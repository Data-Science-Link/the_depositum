# 1 Chronicles Commentary

**These** Books are called by the Greek Interpreters, **Paralipomenon;** (Παραλειπομενων,) that is, *of things left out*, or *omitted;* because they are a kind of supplement of such things as were passed over in the Books of Kings. The Hebrews call them, Dibre Hajamim; that is, *The words of the days*, or *The Chronicles.* Not that they are the books which are so often quoted in *the Kings*, under the title of, *The Words of the days of the kings of Israel*, and *of the kings of Juda;* for the Books of Paralipomenon were written after the Books of Kings; but because, in all probability, they have been abridged from those *ancient words of the days*, by Esdras, or some other sacred author. Ch.—The author of this compilation refers to the same works, 2 Par. 16:11. &c. These journals were principally composed by prophets, though there were other people appointed to write the most important occurrences. 2 K. 8:16, 4 K. 18:18. The genealogies of families, particularly of the Levites, and the interests of piety and religion, are kept most in view. C.—The variations which appear between this work and the other parts of Scripture, are owing to the faults of transcribers; and, though they could not be satisfactorily explained, it would be rashness to condemn the author of inaccuracy, at this distance of time, when we know so little of those transactions. H.—Who calls in question the history of Alexander, though the different authors of it scarcely agree in one calculation of the number of troops, nations conquered, &c.?” Yet the work before us is of far higher authority, as it was dictated by the Holy Ghost. C.—“Without it, a person would in vain pretend to understand the Scriptures.” It is “an epitome of the Old Testament,” and “explains many difficulties of the gospels.” S. Jerom.—The author does not, however, seem to have designed to draw up an exact epitome, or to supply the deficiencies of the other works. C.—The first nine chapters contain various genealogical histories. In the 10th, we have the election and death of Saul; and in the remainder of the first book, the transactions of David, ( W.) till the year 2990, where the second book commences with the reign of Solomon, and brings us to the end of the captivity. A.M. 3468. C.

## Chapter 1

**1** *Seth.* Prot. “Sheth, Enosh, Kenan:” but in Genesis they agree with us, which shews that the translator of the two different books is different, and that there is a want of uniformity in the plan adopted by king James I. H.—The posterity of Cain is neglected, as it all perished in the deluge. C.  
**4** *Noe* begot *Sem, Cham*, and *Japheth.* ( H.) See Gen. 10. The author passes lightly over some of the descendants of the two latter, as he had David’s genealogy principally in view.  
**6** Riphath. Heb. begins with D. C.—But the Prot. correct it ( H.) according to the book of Gen. and the Sept. The two letters are very much alike.  
**7** *Dodanim.* Heb. has R, conformably to the Samar. copy of Genesis, and the Sept. translate the Rhodians. Yet Dodanim seems more accurate, ( C.) and is retained by the Prot. H.  
**10** *Earth*, first establishing the monarchy of Babylon, and building the castle. D.  
**12** *Philistines*, a colony from Crete.  
**17** *Hus* and *Hul* were the immediate sons of Aram, as well as … *Mosoch*, or *Mes;* (Gen. 10:23. C.) so that there seems to be here some transposition. D.  
**18** *Sale.* The Rom. Sept. omits v. 11 to 17, and v. 18 to 24, having only, (17) “The sons of Sem, Ailam and Assur; (24) and Arphaxad, Sala.” H.—But the other copies here insert Cainan, as the father of Sale. See Gen. 10:24. C.—It is a matter of great doubt whether he ought not to be inserted. Lu. 3. H.  
**24** *Sem* begot Arphaxad. M.  
**32** *Concubine.* She was his lawful wife, but of an inferior degree, and such were called concubines. Ch.—She has the title of *wife*, Gen. 25:1.—*And the sons of Dadan*, &c. seems to be copied from Genesis, as the addition is not found in many Lat. MSS. no more than in the Heb. or Sept. C.  
**36** *And by.* This serves to explain the difficulty; as Thamna would otherwise seem to be a daughter of Eliphaz, though we know she was his concubine. Gen. 36:12. H.—The Heb., Rom. Sept. Syr., and Latin, suppose that Thamna was the brother of Amalec; but the Alex. Sept. has, “Now Thamna, the concubine of Eliphaz, bore Amalec.” Arab. “And Thamna, who was the concubine of Eliphaz, the son of Esau, bore him Amalec,” which seems to be the true reading. Kennicott.—Heb. “And Timna and Amalek,” (Prot. H.) which confounds the sense. Mariana. D.  
**38** *Seir*, not Esau, but the Horrite, (Gen. 36:20. M.) which is added in order to explain the origin of Thamna. D.  
**40** *Dixon.* We must add Oolibama. Gen. 36:25.  
**41** *Hamram.* In Gen. *Hamdan.* Two letters have been mistaken since the Chaldee characters have been adopted. C.—On this occasion, we may briefly remark, 1. The most learned fathers have admitted such mistakes in Scripture: yet these are not to be corrected by each one’s private judgment, but we must all abide by the determination of the Church, which is plainly appointed for our guide in the infallible word of God. 2. To obviate the objections of infidels, respecting the apparent contradictions of Scripture, particularly in these books, we must observe that many people and places had different names; 3. And those who had the saem were really distinct. 4. Frequently also grandchildren, and those who have been adopted, are mentioned as the immediate offspring. 5. Some mysterious numbers are specified, as fourteen in the genealogy of Christ, though the history allows more. 6. Odd numbers are sometimes neglected. 7. Often a part is put for the whole, or on the contrary; as Christ is said to have been dead three days, though he was only one whole day and part of two others: and in the reigns of different kings, in the same year, the different parts are assigned to each, as a whole year. 8. Sometimes two reigned together, as Joathan ruled while Ozias was still living, (4 K. 15) and so both reigns are sometimes counted, and, at other times, their respective years. 9. The interregnums are either omitted in calculations, or added to the years of the next ruler. 10. Only the years that a person governed well are sometimes noticed, as Saul is said to have reigned two years, (1 K. 13) though his administration continued much longer. Some of these rules may be applied to most of the scriptural difficulties, as the spirit of God could not dictate any falsehood. At the same time we must be forced to acknowledge that the Scriptures are *hard to be understood*, 2 Peter 1:20. ( W.) and 3:16; and this may serve to exercise the genius, and to humble the pride of man. H.  
**43** *Israel.* The same remark had been made in Gen. 36:31. It is wonderful that the author of this work gives us no further information, when so many revolutions had since occurred. C.—But he might content himself with repeating the words of Moses. H.—The eight kings here specified must have reigned each 50 years, which is not impossible. David conquered the country under Adad.  
**48** *River.* Euphrates is commonly so designated. See Gen. 10:11. C.—Pagnin translates, “from the river Rohoboth.” D.  
**50** *Mezaab.* It is unusual for the Scripture to mark so particularly the genealogy of a woman. We might translate the Heb. “a native, *or* who was a native of Mezaab,” which is probably the same with Dizahab, “abundance of gold.” Deut. 1:1. Mezaab signifies, “waters of gold,” ( C.) or “whose is gold,” whence some infer that the woman was very rich, (Lyran) or had discovered the art of drawing gold thread. Abul.—It is more probably a proper name. M.  
**51** *Kings.* Heb. “Adad also died, and the dukes of Edom were duke Thamna, &c. H.—This, and the following names, designate the place of their residence. M.—The same forms of government prevailed in Idumea, as among the Hebrews, who had judges or dukes, then kings, and, after the captivity, dukes, till the time of the Machabees. T.

## Chapter 2

**1** *Israel*, “seeing, *or* valiant with God,” was before called Jacob, or “a supplanter.” Gen. 35. W.  
**2** Aser*.* They are not placed in the order of their birth. H.  
**3** *Her.* The crime for which he was punished is not specified in Scripture. C.—The Rabbins say that he was so enamoured of the beauty of his wife, that he treated her in the same manner as Onan did afterwards. Cassian viii. 11.—It is supposed that he was slain by a devil, ( C.) like the ( T.) impure husbands of Sarai. Tob. 6:14. H.  
**6** *Zamri*, or Zabdi. Jos. 7:1.—*Etham.* Similar names occur 3 K. 4:30. But they seem to have been different persons.  
**10** *Ram.* He is commonly called *Aram.* But it is to be observed here, once for all, that it was a common thing among the Hebrews for the same person to have different names: and that it is not impossible among so many proper names, as here occur in the first nine chapters of this book, that the transcribers of the ancient Hebrew copies may have made some slips in the orthography. Ch.—*Juda.* Probably the first, appointed by Moses in the desert. Num. 1:7 and 7:12.  
**11** *Salma.* Sept. have “Salmon,” as it is written Ruth 4:20, Mat. 1:4.  
**15** *Seven* *th.* Syriac and Arab. add, “Eliu, (C. 27:18) and the eighth David.” It appears, in effect, the Isai had eight sons, and that David was the youngest. 1 K. 16:10 and 17:12. The Rabbins suppose that one was only adopted, namely, Jonathan, the son of Samma, noted for his prudence and valour. 2 K. 13:3 and 21:21. C.—One might die in his youth, and be therefore omitted, ( T.) as he had done nothing memorable. D.—The Scripture does not always specify the full number. Abul.  
**16** *Sarvia.* The honour shewn to the sisters of David is unusual. The father of the three valiant children of Sarvia is no where specified.  
**17** *Ismahelite*, or more correctly, “Jethra, of Jezrahel;” (2 K. 17:25) though the Heb. and Sept. in that place read “Israelite,” which would be a trifling remark; and it is improbable that Isai would give his daughter to a descendant of Ismahel. C.—The person might, however, have resided among them. D.  
**18** *Caleb*, alias Calubi, v. 9. Ch. W.—He is different from Caleb, the son of Jephone.—*Took*, &c. Heb. “begot Azuba, Ischa, and Jerioth;” or rather with the Sept. “took to wife Gazuba and Jerioth.” C.—Syr. and Arab. “Caleb had Jerioth by his wife Azuba.” We know that the latter was his wife, (v. 19.) and this seems to be the true reading. As *ath* signifies “of or from,” (Noldius) the Heb. only requires a small correction. As it stands at present, it means, “Caleb begot Azuba, a woman, (or wife) and Jerioth.” Prot. supply, “begat *children* of Azuba, *his* wife, and *of* Jerioth.” Kennicott.—*Her sons.* The original determines us to read *her*, instead of “*his*,” as *ejus* would as naturally be understood. If Jerioth was not the wife, she seems to have been the daughter of Caleb; as *Jaser*, &c. were his *sons.* H.  
**20** *Bezeleel*, the famous artist, (Ex. 31:2. C.) or a different person. D.—The Rabbins, who confound Caleb with the son of Jephone, say that he espoused Ephrata, or Mary, the sister of Moses, when he was ten years old, that Ur and Uri had each a child at eight, and the Bezeleel began to work at the tabernacle before he was nine years old. Lyran.—But this is extravagant, and the Bezeleel here mentioned was of the family of Hesron. C.  
**21** *Machir*, grandson of Joseph, whose descendants occupied part of *Galaad*, ( H.) of which he is styled the *father*, or prince. M.—The daughter of Machir was probably an heiress, and Segub dwelt with his mother’s tribe. C.  
**23** **V** **er.** **23** **.** *Aram.* Prot. add “with the towns of Jair from them,” the former possessors; ( H.) or Gessur assisted Aram (Syria) in attacking Israel, 4 K. 10:32. C.—*All these* villages. Prot. supply, “*belonged* *to* the sons.” Sept. “*were* of the sons.” All these were dependencies of Machir, “prince” of Galaad; in which sense *father* is taken, v. 24. M.—*Sons* often denote nephews, &c. W.  
**24** *Hesron.* Perhaps it ought to be Azuba, v. 19. Heb. “and after Hesron was dead, in Caleb-ephrata, then Abia, the wife of Hesron, bore him a (posthumous) son, Ashur, the father of *those who dwelt at* Thecua.” He could not reside there himself no more than Caleb did at Bethlehem, which some, without proof, pretend was called Caleb-ephrata. The Sept. agree with the Vulg. They may signify that Caleb went to the town of Ephrata. But he son of Hebron certainly never resided at Bethlehem. C.  
**25** *And*, is not in Heb. Achia, which may also signify “her sister.” Sept. “brother.” Others take ( C.) Achia to be the first wife of Jerameel. Jan.  
**31** *Oholai*, a daughter, (v. 34. T.) unless this son died before his father. Vatab.  
**42** *Caleb*, or Calubi, v. 9. Ziph, Maresa, and Hebron, are the names of towns, as well as of men. The descendants of Mesa inhabited Ziph, and those of Maresa dwelt at Hebron. The same remark will hold good in other places, where the names of places are put for those who occupied them. C.—*And the sons.* Heb. “and of the sons of Maresa.” Vat.—But it may be as well explained in the sense of the Vulg. Sept. “Marisa, his first-born. He was the father of Ziph, and the sons of Marisa, of the father of Hebron.”—*Father.* Lit. “of the father,” *patris Hebron.* H.  
**47** *Jahaddai.* His name occurs not before. Some suppose he was the son of Mosa: perhaps a verse may be lost, as the Syr. and Arab. pass over this and the two following verses.  
**49** *Achsa*, different from Axa, the grand-daughter of Jephone. Judg. 1:12. H.—Both had daughters of the same name. D.  
**50** *Caleb*, grandson of Calubi. Vatab. &c.—Sobal, his descendant, was prince of those who established themselves at Cariathiarim. C.—The Alex. Sept. seems rather to assert that he was son of Hur, as well as those who follow. “The sons of Hur … Sobal … Salomon, father of Baithlammon, father of Bethleem.” But the editions vary. H.  
**52** *He that saw*, &c. The Latin interpreter seems to have given us here, instead of the proper names, the meaning of those names in the Hebrew. He has done in like manner, v. 55, ( Ch.) and in many other places. D.—Heb. “had sons, *haroe cha hamenuchoth*, ( H.) or *Raia*, Roeh, (C. 4:2) and Chazi *of the canton* of Menuchat, near Babaa. C. 8:6 and Judg. 20:43. Sept. mention Manocho. Jos. 15:60.—We may also translate “the father of Cariathiarim, the prince of half Manuchat, had sons who peopled different cities.” It seems too harsh to call a man “half the place of rest,” or “seeing from the moiety of rest,” though the Heb. has this literal signification. The Sept. give proper names, ( C.) “Araa, Esei, Ammanith,” (but v. 55, half of Manath) and the Prot. “Haroeh *and* half of the Manahattites.” H.—Sobal left to his descendants half the country which he had quietly occupied.  
**53** *Kindr* *ed.* Sept. “Oumasphas.” H.—*Esthaolites.* All these places were in Juda, ( C.) or perhaps ( H.) the two last in Dan, ( M.) or occupied by both tribes. Abul. q. 8.  
**54** *Salma*, or Salmon’s descendants, people Bethlehem, &c.—*Crowns.* Valiant heroes who assisted Joab to gain crowns. W.—Heb. “Hateroth,” the house (Sept. Alex. of the house of Jobab) *of Joab;* ( H.) perhaps the famous general who had land near Absalom’s, on the frontiers of Ephraim, where Ataroth was situated.—*And half.* Heb. “half of the Manahethites.” Prot. ( H.) or “of Menuchat, towards Zarai.” The author seems purposely to mention to whom the cities at first belonged, that the right owners might be reinstated in their possessions, at their return from Babylon. C.—This verse may specify six towns, Bethlehem and Netophat, ( H.) Beth-Joab, Chatsi, Manachti, and Atsothi.  
**55** *Scribes*, learned in the law. M.—*Singing*, &c. The different professions of the Rechabites are here given, instead of proper names, ( C.) which the Vat. Sept. retains.—Thargathiim and Samathiim, Sochathim.—Heb. Tirhatim, “porters;” (Chal.) Shimhathim, “the obedient;” Sucathim, “the inhabitants of tents;” *Calor*, “the heat,” as the Heb. Chamath (Prot. Hemath) signifies. The Cinites dwelt on the south of Juda, for which reason they are probably here mentioned, though some of them also inhabited *Jabes* Galaad, while the Rechabites dwelt in tents, ( H.) and were perhaps employed as *porters* in the temple. C. Jer. 35:5, 19.

## Chapter 3

**1** *Hebron*, during the seven years that he reigned there over Juda. M.—*Jezrahel*, a city of Juda, less noted than the one in Issachar.—*Daniel*, or Cheliab, 2 K. 3:3.  
**2** *Aggith* *.* The mother of Adonias is styled Haggith elsewhere in the Vulg. H.  
**3** *His wife* also. T.—This title refer to all the preceding. Sanctius.  
**5** *Solomon* is put last, though the eldest, because of his genealogy is to be continued. Some think that the three others were the sons of Urias, adopted by David, as Solomon styles himself an only son; (Prov. 4:3) but that only means singularly beloved, and an heir, ( C.) as David had certainly another child by Bethsabee, who died in his infancy. T.—*Bethsabee.* Syr. and Arab. “Bersabee.” Heb. “Bathshuah,” all erroneously.—*Ammiel*, or *Eliam*, (2 K. 11:3) as the same man had two names, ( C.) or, in this instance, we must allow a transposition. H.  
**6** *Elisama*, or Elisua. C. 14:5. C.—Heb. substitutes Elishama and Eliphelet, and Nogah, the last name being “an evident corruption of Nepheg, and the two former being taken in to soon, and still repeated, “in their proper places.” The Vat. Sept. is likewise interpolated, (2 K. 5:14, &c.) by the insertion of eleven names from another version, and two names are twice repeated, so that we have 24 sons of David instead of 11. Kennicott.  
**7** *Noge;* called Noga, (C. 14:6) and omitted entirely in the book of Kings. Eliphaleth being twice mentioned in this book, has made some conclude that David’s first son of this name died in his youth; ( C.) which may be said of Elisama also. Sa.  
**8** *Eliada*, or Elioda, (2 K. 5:16) styled Baaliada, (C. 14:7. C.) as both have the same meaning, “God’s, *or* the Lord’s knowledge.” H.—*Nine*, excluding the children of Bethsabee. In 2 K. there are only seven, or, with the sons of Bethsabee, eleven. There must be a mistake in one place, unless the book of Kings only specifies those who were then alive. Vatab. C.  
**9** *The concubines.* The inferior wives. Ch.—Some of the preceding sons were born of such, v. 6, &c.—*Thamar.* She is the only one whose name is mentioned, but David had other *daughters.* 2 K. 6:13.  
**15** *Johanan*, who is not mentioned in 4 K. 23 and 24. Some think that he died young, (Tostat) or in battle with his father, against Pharao. Pradus.—*Joakim*, or Eliacim, possessed the throne after Joachaz, or *Sellum*, ( C.) which name signifies “confusion,” and was given to all the sons of Josias. S. Jer.—Then came Joachin and Sedecias, whose proper name was Matthanias. H.—Joakim is passes over by S. Mat. S. Jer. ib.  
**16** *Jechonias*, who is called also Joakim, ( W.) and Cenias in Heb. Jer. 22:28. C.—Both the son and the grandson of Josias go under the name of Jechonias. Mat. 1:11. Barrad. i. 5. 16. M.—*Sedecias.* If this be the same with the king, *was born* must signify succeeded, as we know that Joakim was not the father of Sedecias. Grotius, &c.  
**17** *Asir*, means a “prisoner,” so that we might translate, Heb. “and the sons of Jechoias, the prisoner, (at Babylon, 4 K. 24:15) were Salathiel.” C.—Prot. “Assir, Salathiel his son.” H.—Some think that the following were the adopted children, or successors of Jechonias; as S. Luke (3:24) insinuates that Neri was the father of Salathiel, and Jeremias (22:30) seems to declare that Jechonias should have no children. But he means such as should sit on the throne, as he explains himself, and S. Matthew (1:12) expressly says, *Jechonias begot Salathiel.*  
**18** *Melchiram*, &c. born of Salathiel. C.—*Sama.* Sept. “Osamo and Nabadias.” Prot. “Hosahama,” &c. H.  
**19** *Phadaia*, called also Salathiel, (Mat. 1:12) or these two brothers had each a son named Zorobabel. The grandson of Salathiel was called Abiud, and that of Phadaia, Mosollam, ( M.) unless these were the same person. Sa.—Phadaia, son of Salathiel, and father of Zorobabel, left his son to the care of his brother Salatheil, who was therefore accounted the father of Zorobabel too. C.  
**21** *Son.* Heb. “sons of Hananias, Phaltias, and Jesacias, the sons of Raphias, the sons of Arnan, … (22) the sons of Sechenias, Semeia, &c.” But the Sept. and Syriac have read in a more intelligible manner, ( C.) intimating that these people were lineally descended from each other, ( H.) while the Heb. leaves us ignorant of the names of the sons of Rephaias, &c. C.  
**22** *Six.* Counting the father in the number. Ch.—Heb. shisha, or “six.” Sixtus V. with several MSS. Gothic edit. &c. take it improperly for the name of a man. C.—Semeia and his five sons are attributed to Sechenias. W.—Others think that a name has been lost. Castal.  
**24** **V** **er.** **24** **.** *Oduia*, the 12th from Zorobabel, which shews that this has been inserted since the time of Esdras, and that the author was very careful to preserve the genealogical tables, as it was not known from what family of the descendants of David the Messias should be born. C.—S. Matthew gives us a different genealogy. D. C.

## Chapter 4

**1** *Charmi*, the great-grandson of Juda, by Zara and Zamri. Jos. 7:1.—Junius takes him to be the same with Calubi, (C. 2) father of *Sobal.* This seems to be transcribed from another ancient register of the family of Juda, and designed to shew where the principal men had resided. C.—Only the chiefs are specified. D.  
**2** *Sarathi*, who peopled Saraa. C.  
**3** *Posterity.* So all the ancient versions seem to have read *boni*, instead of the present Heb. abi, which literally means, “and these are the father of Etam.” If words ever wanted sense, they do so here. Kennicott.—Etham is perhaps the name of a town. Malv.  
**7** *Ethnan.* Some would insert “and Cos,” to connect this with the following.  
**8** *Cos.* Perhaps ( C.) the same with Cenez, v. 13. T.  
**9** *Jabes.* That is, *sorrowful.* Ch.—There seems to be something wanting, as we are not informed who were the brethren of Jabes. C.—This name he received from his mother, while his father Cos, called him Othoniel. E.  
**10** *For.* To reward his piety and vow. Othoniel obtained Cariath-sepher, and Axa, the daugher of Caleb. Jos. 15:17. C.—Jabes imitated holy Jacob, (Gen. 28) and both desired temporal blessings, for their advancement in virtue. W.  
**11** *Caleb.* Heb. “Celub,” different bother from Calubi and the son of Jephone, v. 15. C.—*Brother*, &c. Sept. “father of Ascha,” which would seem to make him the same with the latter.  
**12** *City.* Heb. “Hir-Nachash.” H.—The latter term denotes “copper of a serpent.” We know not where this city was situated, no more than Recha. C.  
**13** *Othoniel*, first judge. H.—He was brother, or rather cousin, of Caleb. See Jos. 15:17.  
**14** *Artificers.* Heb. Charashim, which means various sorts of “workmen,” ( C.) or “father (prince. M.) of Ge-Harasim, for,” &c. C.—Under this lord the artificers dwelt who built the temple. W.  
**15** *Caleb*, so memorable ( C.) for this fidelity. Num. 13:30. and 32:12. H.  
**18** *Judaia*, a second wife, of his own nation. By the first, from Egypt, Mered had Miriam, &c. Some words seem to be lost, which render it doubtful to whom Judaia was married.  
**19** *Odaia*, perhaps the same with Judaia, ( C.) as the Sept. read.—*Who was.* Heb. and Sept. “Machatha,” ( H.) a place to the north of Basan, far from the limits of Juda, whence we should, perhaps, read Menuchat, as C. 2:52, 54.  
**21** *Her.* Hitherto we have seem the possessions of the descendants of Phares. Those of Her inhabited the country rendered famous by the exploits of Samson with the jaw bone. Judg. 15:9. C.—The first-born of Sela was called *Her*, after his unfortunate uncle. Gen. 38:7. H.—*That wrought.* Sept. take it for a proper name, “Ebdath.” Heb. Beth-habodath habuts, “the house of the byssus, or fine linen manufacturers in *Beth-Ashbaah*,” ( H.) which is, perhaps, the same with Beersabee, “the well of swearing.” Gen. 21:31. C.—*Oath.* The Latin word *juramenti*, might be retained here, as well as *Calor.* C. 2:55. See 2 K. 21:19. Sept. read, “Esoba,” as the proper name of a place. H.  
**22** *He, that made*, &c. viz. *Joazim*, the meaning of whose name in Hebrew, is, *he that made the sun to stand.* In like manner the following names, *Lying*, (Cozeba) *Secure*, (Joash) and *Burning*, (Saraph) are substituted in place of the Hebrew names of the same signification. Ch.—The first etymology is not perfectly accurate, as Jokim means simply, “he made to stand;” Jachin, the pillar which Solomon erected, has the same import. H.—Some injudicious person seems to have placed *the sun* in the margin, whence it has crept into the text. T.—It might be occasioned by the fable of the Rabbins, who assert ( H.) that Elimelech wrought the like miracle as Josue, to convince the people of Bethlehem of the necessity of being converted; but, finding them incorrigible, denounced a famine, which forced him to retire with his family into the country of Moab. S. Jer. Trad. &c.—Elimelech died in that country; but these four descendants of Sela retired, probably, along with him, and returned afterwards to Lehem, or Bethlehem, as it is customary to omit a part of a word. T.—This town was peopled by different branches of Juda’s family, v. 4, and C. 2:54. C.—*Lahem*, &c. Sept. seem to leave the original terms: “he made them return to Abedderim Athoukiim.”—*Who returned*, is also left as a proper name by the Prot. ( H.) &c. “And Jasubi Lehem.” Vat. M.—It is not easy to decide, when the Hebrew words should be translated.—*Old.* Heb. “and ancient words;” ( H.) records, shewing where these families resided, ( C.) unless this be also the name ( H.) of a place. Sept.  
**23** *Potters.* Heb. yotserim, may also designate some family, as it seems improbable that the *princes*, in Moab, should be reduced to so mean a condition. But we have many examples of such a fall; ( H.) and it is supposed, that these descendants of Sela were employed by the *king* of Babylon, at Nethaim and Gadera. C.—*Hedges.* These are the proper names of the places where they dwelt. In Hebrew, *Netahim* and *Gedera.* Ch.—Sept. “Ataim and Gadera.” H.—The correct Roman edition of the Vulg. prints these words, *plantationibus et Sepibus*, with large letters, to imply as much. M.—*King;* David. Sa. M.—Many of the tribe of Juda attended David, while he was forced to flee before Saul, and to hide himself in unfrequented places. Some of them might be these *Yotserim*, or they might follow the profession of *potters.* H.—“With the king they were powerful in his kingdom, and dwelt there.” Sept. H.—The Vulg. often give the meaning of proper names. D.  
**24** *Namuel*, or Jamuel. Gen. 46:10.—*Jarib;* perhaps the same with Sohar, ( M.) unless the latter be Zara, or Zare. Num. 26:12. These genealogies seem different; but the same person ( C.) might have many names. D.  
**27** *Juda*, probably, not even in the following cities, which they inhabited along with them. This tribe of Simeon was always the weakest, and kept close to Juda. See Num. 26:14.  
**30** *Bathuel* appears to be the same with Bethulia. Judith 6:7. C.  
**31** *David*, who had Siceleg given to him, 1 K. 27:6. H.—After the schism, Juda straitened the tribe of Simeon; so that it was forced to seek for other habitations in Gador, under Ezechias, v. 39, &c. C.—It could no longer reside among those of the tribe of Juda, ( D.) and acknowledge another king. H.  
**33** *Baal*, or Ballath. Jos. 19:1.—*Distribution.* Heb. and Sept. “and their genealogy.” M.—Καταλογισμος, may as well have the former signification, “their class;” ( H.) though the sequel seems to determine it in the latter sense. D.  
**34** *Mosabab.* This and the following princes joined their forces, to conquer fresh territories from Gador, ( H.) or Gadara, near Joppe, (Strabo xvi.) which had been long in the possession ( H.) of the Egyptians, (v. 40. C.) or Philistines. Malvenda.  
**40** *Cham.* It is not certain that the Philistines, who came from the country of the Casluim, were descendants of Mezraim. Gen. 10:14. But it is very clear that the Egyptians sprung from Cham. Ps. 77:51.  
**41** *Inhabitants.* Sept. “and the Mineans.” Heb. meyenim, “the inhabitants of Maon,” in Arabia. See Judg. 10:11. Syr. and Arab. “the fountains.”  
**42** *Jesi;* perhaps Asaia, by the transposition of one letter; (v. 36. C.) or these chiefs were remote descendants of Jesi, v. 20. H.—The expedition probably took place about the same time as the preceding, to avoid the attack of the Assyrians, or of Juda, by retiring farther into Arabia. C.  
**43** *Escape* the arms of Saul, or of David. D.—*Day.* It seems, therefore, that they escaped captivity, having abandoned their own country; or this was taken from a record, which had been made before that event, and is here inserted by Esdras; though, when he wrote, these Simeonites might have experienced the fate of their brethren, who were led captives in the 6th year of Ezechias. H.

## Chapter 5

**1** *First-born.* Gen. 49:4. W.—He gives this reason for not beginning with him. C.—*And he.* Prot. “and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birth-right.” H.  
**2** *Accoun* *ted to Joseph*, viz. as to the double portion, which belonged to the first-born: but the princely dignity was given to Juda, and the priesthood to Levi. Ch.—Yet it is not certain that the latter dignity formed a part of the birth-right, (Gen. 25:31) and the author takes no notice of it. C.—The double portion seems to have been all the privilege. Deut. 21:17. Sept. “the blessing *or* gift was Joseph’s.” Hebrew also does not specify *princes*, but “the leader,” ( H.) the Messias, (Syr. &c.) and kings, from David till the captivity. C. Gen. 49:4. W.  
**4** *Joel.* It does not appear whether he was the son of the last, or of Henoch.  
**6** *Beera*, This tribe continued to have princes of their own, after the division of the kingdom. Beera was in power when Thelgathphalnasar, or Theglathphalasar, took five tribes into captivity. 4 K. 15:29. Only twelve generations are mentioned to fill up about 750 years, from the leaving of Egypt. C.—But Enoch must have lived much sooner, as the Israelites continued in that country at least 215 years. The princes are probably not all specified, as on other occasions. H.  
**7** *Families*, when they were led captive into Assyria; ( M.) or before, when the tribe was in a most flourishing condition.—*Princes.* Heb. and Sept. “prince.”—*Jehiel.* Sept. “Joel,” v. 4.  
**8** *And.* So Heb. &c. as f he was one of the princes. But the Vulg. seems to begin a new sentence, *Porro*, “now Bala.” The possessions of this man must have been very extensive, from the Euphrates till ( H.) Baal-meon, within nine miles of Hesebon, (Eus.) almost ( C.) as far as the Jordan. T.—Bala, or his descendants, extended their conquests as far as the Euphrates, which had been promised to Israel; and, under Saul, conquered the *Agarites*, who sprung from Agar. Syr. &c. “the Arabs of Sacca,” or the Scenites, “dwelling under *tents*,” and inhabiting the Desert Arabia. The details of this war are probably given, v. 19, &c. C.  
**9** *Cattle*, for which reason they desired to have this country. Num. 32:4. M.  
**11** *Selcha*, not far from Jabok. Deut. 3:10. C.  
**12** *Chief*, (*in capite* *.*) Sept. “first-born.” H.—This list was made under Joathan, king of Juda, when Joel was at the head of the tribe of Gad. C.—*Basan*, the capital city, v. 16. Sa. M.  
**15** *And*, &c. Heb. also, “Achi, son of Abdiel.”—*Chief*, like the preceding, each in their respective *families.* C.—They were relations ( H.) of the same tribe. M.  
**16** *Saron*, in Basan; (Jos. 12:18) different from those vallies near Joppe, ( C.) and between Thabor and Tiberias. Euseb.  
**17** *Israel.* Jeroboam II. had been dead two years before Joathan was born: unless some of the numbers be incorrect; which seem very probable. 4 K. 15:5. Yet these registers might be made at different times, and one, perhaps, under Jeroboam I. as when any war seemed to threaten, the number of soldiers was to be known. C.—It does not appear why the king of Juda is mentioned, as the people were not under his dominion, unless ( H.) he was contemporary with Jeroboam II. as some assert. M.—Yet the following expedition seems to have taken place while Israel was still faithful to God. H. *By faith they overcame kingdoms.* Heb. 11. W.  
**19** *But*, &c. Heb. “and Jetur, &c. (20) and they were helped by God against them.” H.—Sept. “they prevailed over them, and the Agarites,” &c. The ancient, or higher Iturea, lay between Hermon and Manasses; but the lower, which Josephus includes under this name, took in the deserted possessions of that half tribe. C.—The former ( H.) extended from Jordan by Libanus, to the mountains of Tyre. M.—*And Naphis*, sons of Ismael. Gen. 25:13. H.  
**22** *Lord.* Very dreadful, and in obedience to God’s orders.—*Captivity*, v. 6. C.  
**23** *Basan*, which belonged to Gad. H.—In Josue (17:5.) Basan and Galaad seem to be given to Manasses; but the former there denotes all the level country, from the Jabok to the Jordan, as Galaad is put for the mountains on the East. C.—*Great.* It would take thirty hours to travel from the torrent Jabok to Baal Hermon. Adric. M.  
**26** *Assur.* These princes were scourges in the hand of God, to punish the guilty. H.—The former forced Israel to pay tribute; the latter carried many into captivity, 4 K. 15:19, 29 and 16:7. C.—*Lahela*, or Hala and Haber, cities watered by the river Gozan.—*Ara;* perhaps Rages. Tob. 1:16, &c. D.

## Chapter 6

**1** *Levi.* The genealogy of the Levites is given with more exactitude than any of the preceding. Caath formed two branches, 1. the priests, descended from Aaron; 2. all his other children, who were simply Levites. C.—Hence they are placed after the priests. M.  
**2** *Isaar*, or Aminadab, v. 22.  
**3** *Abiu.* These died without children. The genealogy of *Eleazar* is given, as his family enjoyed the pontificate a long time, while that of Ithamar is neglected, ( C.) as only Heli and a few others were raised to that dignity. H.  
**4** *Eleazar.* The nine following generations to Sadoc may be immediate. D.  
**5** *Abisue.* He is mentioned no where else. Josephus (v. ult.) calls him Abiezer. C.—Many of these high priests were very obscure. M.—*Ozi*, after whom Heli is supposed to have reigned, so that Zaraias and the three following were excluded, ( C.) while Heli, and four of the same family of Ithamar, were acknowledged as high priests. T.—Abiathar was then forced to give place to Sadoc, (3 K. 2:26. H.) whose family was in power at the captivity, v. 15. T.—Nicephorus (ii. 4.) and Josephus (x. 11.) mention other high priests besides these. W.  
**9** *Azarias.* Perhaps the same who is called Amarias, (2 Par. 19:11) as *Johanan* is probably the illustrious Joiada, 4 K. 11:4.  
**10** *This* may refer to either. C.—The Holy Ghost gives an encomium to Joiada, for re-establishing the divine worship, (Junius) or to Azarias, for withstanding the impious attempt of king Osias. E. T. &c. 2 Paral. 26:17. M.  
**12** *Sellum*, or Mosollam. C. 9:11. C.  
**15** *Went out*, into captivity, while his father was slain. 4 K. 25:18. More than 22 priests would be requisite to fill up near 900 years. See Salien.  
**16** *Gerson.* Hebrew here reads Gersom, though it had Gerson before, v. 1.  
**18** *The*, &c. This verse is repeated from v. 2 as the author is now going to continue the genealogy of the Levites, in their natural order, ( H.) to Samuel. D.  
**20** *Jahath.* See v. 42, 43.—*Zamm* *a* springs from Semei, Jeth, Gerson, and has a son named Ethan, who has Adaia; as Zara begot Athanai, v. 41. Almost all the names are rather different  
**22** *Asir.* While Core perished, his children were preserved. Num. 16:30 and 26:11. H.  
**23** *Asir.* This name seems superfluous (v. 36, Ex. 6:24. C.) perhaps taken from the preceding verse. H.—The two former were sons of Core, v. 25, 37. C.  
**26** *Sophai, Nahath*, and *Eliab*, are called Suph, ( H.) Thohu, (v. 34. C.) and Eliel. H.—Sophai may be a surname of Elcana. Poole. D.  
**27** *Elcana, his son.* It seems necessary to supply, “Samuel, his son,” ( H.) as he descended from the 3d Elcana. D.  
**28** *Vasseni.* Some Latin copies subjoin “Joel,” who was the first-born, (v. 33.) La Haye.—Vasseni means, “and the second;” which can hardly be considered as the name of the eldest son, tough some have take it as such, in like manner as they have explained *six.* C. 3:22. But then the v ought at least to be omitted, ( C.) as it is in the Vat. and Alex. Sept. “Sani and Abia.” H.—Other editions insert “Joel,” with the Syr. and Arab. C.—This person had therefore either two names, or Joel has been omitted, and we should translate “Joel and the second, Abia.” M.—These brothers acted so ill as judges, that the people took occasion to demand a king. 1 K. 8:3.  
**31** *The singing.* Heb. “the hands *or* places of the canticle,” the two tribunes on each side of the altar. Heman presided over the band in the middle, while Asaph directed those on the right, and Ethan those on the left, v. 33, 39, and 44. C.—*Placed.* Heb. “rested,” as before David’s time it had been carried about. He erected a tabernacle for it on Sion, and directed the Levites to attend in order, (C. 25) so that some should be present every day ( M.) to honour God, both by instruments and vocal music, while the priests performed their sacred functions with the utmost decency.  
**33** *Heman.* Some families among the Levites were more distinguished than the rest, having authority to regulate the singers, and to give the tune. Hence many psalms are addressed to these three masters of music. Yet from those titles we cannot surely infer that those psalms were composed by Asaph, &c. C.  
**34** *Eliel.* Many of the genealogies do not seem to agree in these first 10 chapters, as some more obscure names have been passed over, ( M.) or the people had different names, or, through the fault of transcribers, some alteration has taken place, which could hardly be avoided, without a constant miracle. H.  
**39** *Brother*, or relation, though of the family of Gerson. He also followed the same profession as Ethan did, v. 44.  
**44** *Ethan* is also called Idithun (C. 25:1. 8) in the Psalms. C.  
**48** *Brethren.* All the other Levites, who were not Cantors. M.  
**49** *Offerings*, which is here the meaning of *incensum* *;* as “incense” was not burnt on this altar, but only victims. Ex. 29:13.  
**53** *Sadoc.* By God’s ordinance Heli had been appointed. But the dignity still subsisted in Aaron’s family. W.—*Achimaas*, who was pontiff in the days of Solomon. This genealogy had been brought down to the Captivity, (v. 3, &c.) which shews that the author give extracts from different records.  
**55** *Suburbs*, or 2000 cubits round the city. See Jos. 20 and 21. C.  
**57** *Of*, is not authorized by the Vulg. *civitates*, but is added, to signify that all these 13 cities were not thus privileged. H.—There were only six cites of refuge, of which *Hebron* was one. See Josue 20:7. C. M.—Prot. “And to the sons of Aaron they gave the cities of Juda, *namely*, Hebron, *the city of* refuge.” But “such a licence to insert words at pleasure, cannot be allowed.” Heb. lit. “they gave cities of Hebrew refuge, Hebron,” &c. The “sense absolutely disallows the word *Judah*,” which is omitted, (Jos. 21:13) as well as in some Heb. MSS. in the Bamberg, and Complut. editions, and in those of Jablonski and Michaelis.—*Hari*, “cities,” ought to be hir, “a city,” as only one is meant. We should also add with the Arab. and Syriac, and the parallel passage in Josue, “and her suburbs,” after Hebron. Kennicott.—“Juda” is not found in the Sept. &c.: and Buxtorf acted with little wisdom, when he thought he had sufficiently answered Capellus, by observing that the Masora declared the word to be authentic. *Anticrit.* It is a great misfortune that most of the printed Heb. editions have been given under such influence; and that the Masorets have defaced so many MSS. by their corrections. H.—Hence they probably burnt all the first edition of Naples, 1487, except part of a single copy, comprising the Cethubim given to Eton college by Dr. Pellet, which omits the word Juda. Kennicott. Dis. i. p. 520–2.  
**59** *Asan*, perhaps Jethnan, or Ain. Jos. 15:23 and 21:15. Syriac adds Ethra. C.—*Bethsames* *.* Sept. Alex. subjoins, “Baither and its suburbs.” H.—All these cities were in the tribes of Juda and of Simeon. M.  
**60** *Almath.* Jos. *Almon.*—*Thirteen;* but Geta and Gabaon are not here expressed. Jos. 21:16, 17. C.—Sept. Alex. inserts, “Lebee,” before, and “Anchos, with its suburbs,” after Anathoth, thus making 14; but these additional cities are not sacerdotal. H.  
**61** *Out of.* We may supply, “the tribe of Dan, Ephraim, &c.” as only two cities belonged to Manasses. Jos. 21:25. C.—Double that number was taken from the two other tribes. M.  
**65** *Them.* The priests, v. 54. D.—*Names.* Some being styled of the priests, ( C.) other of the Levites, ( M.) whose dominion as thus asserted. C.  
**66** *The cities*, or rather “some cities,” as all were not in the tribe of Ephraim. H.  
**67** *Of the.* Lit. “cities to flee to, (*or* of refuge) Sichem,” ( H.) which might induce some to suppose that all these cities were of this description; but, in reality, only Sichem had that privilege. C.—Sept. is liable to the same ambiguity. See v. 57. ( H.) Jos. 20:7 and 21:21.  
**68** *Jecmaan*, or *Cibsaim*, (Jos.) as *Helon* is put for *Aialon* below. *And of the tribe of Dan, Eltheco and Gabathon* is omitted. See Jos. 21:23.  
**70** Aner and *Baalam*, perhaps the same as *Thanach* and *Gethremmon*, which were given *to the children of Caath of the inferior degree*, (Jos. 21:26. C.) or, *who were left* out of the rank of priests, ( M.) or before unprovided for, as the partition was made at different times.—*Baalam.* Heb. “Balaam.” Sept. “Iblaam” is the Jeblaam. Jos. 17:11.  
**71** *Astharoth*, or Bosra. C.—Heb. Hashtaroth. Jos. 21:27. H.  
**72** *Cedes … Ramoth*, and *Anem*, are Cesion, Jaramoth, and Engannim. Jos. 21:28, 29.  
**75** *Hucac … Hamon*, and *Cariathaim*, are Helcath, Hammoth-Dor, and Carthan.  
**77** *Remmono and Thabo* *r*, or, Jecham and Cartha. H.—Damna and Naalol are here omitted. Jos. 21:35. There was formerly a town on Thabor, perhaps called Ceselet Thabor. Jos. 19:12, Judg. 4:6. C.  

---

## Chapter 7

**1** *Jasub*, or Job. See Gen. 46:13, Num. 26:23. C.—*Simeron*, elsewhere Samron and Semran; ( M.) which shews, either that the names have been differently pronounced, or that the transcribers have erred. H.  
**2** *Chiefs.* They were at the head of distinct families. M.—*David.* We know that David took an account of his fighting men. 2 K. 24. But it is not certain that this register was made at that time; as we read that Benjamin was not numbered. C. 21:6. These lists were probably made when some expedition was intended by David. The author was not, perhaps, able to recover the accounts of Nephthali, Manasses, and Ephraim, no more that the genealogies of Dan (v. 12) and Zabulon, which do not appear in this book. C.  
**3** *Sons*, for “the son.” D.—*Izrahia.* He alone deserved to be mentioned. See v. 6, where only three sons of Benjamin appear, though there were more, C. 8:2. T.—*Five*, comprising Israhia, “all chiefs,” ( H.) men of note, ( D.) or one name may be lost. C.  
**4** *Children*, who had numerous offspring; ( H.) so that, in the days of David, these descendants of Thola, amounted to so many. M.  
**5** *War.* In all, this tribe could muster 145,600 men, at that time. C.  
**6** *Benjamin;* a man, perhaps, of the tribe of Issachar. See v. 10. Or the patriarch had originally ten sons, (Gen. 46:21) or grandsons, five of whom only had children, and perhaps tow of their families perished entirely in the war with the other tribes; (Judg. 20:46) so that, under David, only three branches were acknowledged. C.—*Jadihel*, or *Asbel* in Genesis.  
**7** *Urai*, a grandson, called Hir, v. 12. C.—*Five chiefs*, but inferior to the *seven* original families, (Num. 26:38. M.) unless the fortune of war had made great changes, or some of the lists be imperfect. C.  
**12** *And Hapham;* called Mophim and Ophim, (Gen. 46) and Suphim and Hupham, Num. 26:39.—*Aher*, in Heb. means, “another” son, called Hazim: or more probably Aher ought to be Dan, the father of Husim, (Gen. 46:23) as Dan and Nephthali had both the same mother, Bala, v. 13. C.  
**14** *Son.* Heb. “sons … Ezriel, whom she bare.” This seems imperfect. The Hebrews seldom name the mother. C.—Sept. intimate that the Syrian wife was mother of both. H.—*Galaad*, whose posterity enjoyed the country of the same name, (Num. 22:29 and 32:41) only Machir in mentioned as the son of Manasses.  
**15** *And Saphan.* S. Jerom seems to have taken them for women. If they were the sons of Hir, (v. 12) Machir probably adopted them. Heb. “Machir took a wife from Happhim,” &c. But does one woman marry two men? Syr. and Arab. “Machir took a wife one of the sisters of Huphim and Suphim, (the great and powerful) named Maacha.” C.—Prot. “*the sister* of Huppim … whose sister’s name *was* Maachah.” H.—Hebrew may have this sense, with a small alteration. C.—Le Clerc thinks that the name of the woman has been lost, and the text altered.—*Second.* This also seems defective, as no first had been mentioned. C.—Two intervened between Machir and Salphaad, namely, Galaad and Hepher, (Num. 26:29 and 27:1. M.) so that Salphaad was his great-grandson. H.  
**17** *Badan*, perhaps the same with Jair; (Judg. 10:3, 1 K. 12:11. C.) or rather in this last place, the Syr. &c. read more correctly Barac, and Samson instead of *Samuel*, who was then speaking. See Heb. 11:32. There was no such deliverer as Badan, but the word has been corrupted from Barac. Sept. Kennicott.  
**18** *Queen.* Heb. “Moleceth bore Ishehod.” S. Jerom and the Latin Church translate these names. W.—Prot. “Hammoleketh bore Ishod.” H.—The proper names might have been as well retained, ( C.) as in the Sept. H.—Some suppose that the mother of Josue, or Debora, may be designated. Rabbins.—*Abiezer*, (19) *Leci*, are the Jeser and Chelek. Num. 26:30.  
**20** *Bared, Thahath*, probably called *Becher* and Theken, in Num. Three alone are there mentioned, though the other thirteen, whose names are given, seem to have been all the immediate sons of Ephriam, ( C.) since he mourns for them, (v. 22. M.) and his other children afterwards. H.—The dreadful slaughter made them, is perhaps the reason why only three are mentioned in Numbers, and none in Genesis.  
**21** *Son, Ezer.* Heb. “and Ezer and Elad.” *His son*, after each, seems to be twice omitted, as these were in the same degree as the rest. Sept. agree with the Vulg. H.—*Because they*, the sons of Ephraim, ( C. &c.) or the *men of Geth* *.* Syr. and Arab. D. M. T.—The text is ambiguous, but the former supposition seems more rational, ( H.) and more generally received. C.  
**23** *Beria.* This name signifies, *in evil*, or *in affection.* Ch.—*Briae*, “in howling.” M.  
**24** *Daughter*, or great grand-daughter, repaired these three cities. C.—The last, probably, was called after her. H.—But its situation is unknown. C.  
**25** *Thale.* Heb. “and Thale, his son, and Thaan, his son.” These seem to have been the sons of Ephraim. The following were their descendants. H.—At least Elisama was prince in the wilderness, ( C.) under Moses; (Num. 1:10. H.) and Josue, the sixth from Ephraim, was 54 years old, when the Israelites left Egypt. C.  
**29** *Daughters.* Sept. “villages.”—*Joseph*, by Ephraim and Manasses, west of the Jordan. H.  
**34** *Aram.* Add, “and Helem,” ( C.) unless Helem was the first-born (v. 35) of *Ahi*, which signifies “brother.” Perhaps Helem was brother of Somer, called Hotham, v. 32.  
**37** *Jethran.* Sept. “Jether,” as v. seq.  
**38** *Jephone.* The father of Caleb was of the tribe of Juda. C.  
**40** *Of captains;* a Hebrew idiom, to denote the most excellent. H.—Heb. “chief of the princes.” All mentioned from v. 30, were at the hand of their tribe, in succession, and led their brethren to battle. C.  

---

## Chapter 8

**1** *Benjamin.* Some farther particulars of his genealogy are given, for the honour of Saul; ( C.) and many of these, who returned from captivity, are mentioned. 1 Esd. 10:11. Sanctius.—*Bale*, &c. are called *Bela*, ( M. C. 7:6.) *Jadiel*, and *Ahiram*, or *Echi*, Num. 26:36 and Gen. 46.  
**2** *Nohaa* is probably styled Bechor; and *Rapha*, Ros, in Genesis.  
**3** *Addar*, Ared or Hered. C.  
**6** *Ahod*, the judge. Judg. 3:15.—*Manahath;* the Menuchat, in the tribe of Juda, (C. 2:54) after the captivity. C.—Abulensis thinks Manahath was in Moab, v. 8. M.  
**7** *And.* Lit. “but,” *autem* *.* H.—The sentence is clearer without this particle. M.—*Naaman* was the first-born of Ahod; and Gera prevailed on his brethren to leave Gabaa, ( T.) and was probably the father of Oza. C.  
**8** *Saharim.* His father is not specified: but his was a Benjamite. M.—Some force the Heb. text to say that Ahod had three sons, whom he sent to form a colony at Manahath, and afterwards he had three others by his two wives, and at last, by Rodes, he had Jobab, &c. C.—*Begot.* Prot. “*children* in the country of Moab, after he had sent them away: Hushim and Baara *were* his wives.” But the Sept. intimate, that “Saharim begot … after he had sent away Osim, and his wife Baara, and he begot of Ada,” &c. H.—He had perhaps retired into Moab, at the same time as Elimelech. Ruth 1. T.—Those who were sent away were men, (*eo* *s*) according to the Hebrew, unless ( H.) the word should be eas. D.  
**11** *Mehusim* *.* Heb. and Sept. “of Husim (v. 8) he begot.”  
**12** *Ono* was three miles from *Lod*, or Diospolis, (Lightfoot) built after the return from Babylon, (1 Esd. 2:23. C.) in the territory of Benjamin. M.  
**13** *And Sama.* They are supposed to have been sons of Elphaal. C.—*Aialon* belonged to Dan. Jos. 19:42. But it was near Benjamin, ( M.) and was probably occupied by people chiefly of that tribe. H.—*Geth.* We know not at what period.  
**16** *Baria*, son of Elphaal. Whether the following were his brothers does not appear certain, as it seems more natural to have placed all his father’s children together, v. 12 and 18.  
**21** *Semei;* perhaps Sama, v. 13. C.—Sept. read, Samai. H.  
**25** *Sesac*, probably mentioned in v. 14. C.—Sept. have “Sosek,” in both places.  
**28** *Families.* Heb. “These *were* heads of the fathers by their generations, chief *men.*” Prot. H.—*Jerusalem*, probably after the captivity. We find none of these names from v. 14, in the days of Josue; and it was not easy for people to establish themselves at Jerusalem, till David had expelled the Jebusites. C.—Yet we find that the tribes of Juda and Benjamin had seized the lower city long before. Jos. 18:28. H.  
**29** *Dwelt.* Lit. “they dwelt.” But Heb. and Sept. “in Gabaon, dwelt the father of Gaboan,” ( H.) who was called Jehiel, (C. 9:35) or Abiel. 1 K. 9:1. C.—The following verses are repeated in the next chapter, ( H.) and seem to have been originally the same; though now many variations occur, which shew that “every Hebrew letter” has not been preserved. Kennicott.  
**30** *Baal.* Add, “and Ner,” (v. 33. C. 9:36) as the Sept. have it here also.  
**31** *Zacher*, or Zacharias. C. 9. Heb. omits the following name, as well as ( H.) the end of the preceding one. Kennicott.—The Alex. Sept. has the same faults. But the Vatican retains Macelloth. H.  
**32** *Over-against*, in the vicinity, while some remained at Gabaon. See Gen. 16:12. C.—The family of Cis resided at Gabaa. 1 K. 10:26. M.  
**33** *Ner*, son of Abiel, or of Jeheil, prince of Gabaon, v. 29. H.—From Aphia sprung Bechorah, Seror, Abiel, (1 K. 9) who is also called Ner and Jehiel. He had Ner, the father of Abner, and Cis, father of Saul. M.—Abinadab, or Jessui. 1 K. 14:49. C.—*Esbaal*, alias Isboseth. Ch.—The Hebrews avoid pronouncing the name of the idol, and substitute *b* *oseth*, “confusion.” C.—Hence it is clear that many had two names. D.  
**34** *Meribbaal*, alias Mephiboseth. 2 K. 4:4. Ch. 2 K. 9. M.  
**36** *Joada*, or *Jara.* C. 9:42. C.—“Strange mistakes these!” Kennicott.  
**40** *Archers*, particularly the natives of Gabaa. Judg. 20:16. Jonathan is praised for his skill. 2 K. 1:22. M.—*Benjamin.* We might hence conclude that here ended the genealogy of that family. Yet we find it partly repeated in the following chapter, v. 35. H.

## Chapter 9

**1** *Israel.* These registers were preserved by those who fled from the arms of Salmanasar, into the kingdom of Juda. Such records were preserved with the utmost care, and were collected by the author; who could give an account of what happened during and after the captivity, as he was an irreproachable eye-witness; not to mention the divine inspiration, which places his testimony out of the reach of criticism. C.—*And Juda;* perhaps by some historian. M.—*Babylon*, while Israel was removed elsewhere, by the Assyrians. H.—The genealogies of Israel being hitherto recited, now those who came back from captivity appear. W.  
**2** *First.* He only treats of those who returned first, ( T.) under Esdras. H.—Nehemias brought back others, and more returned afterwards. Many also retook possession of their lands, which they had enjoyed before the captivity. 1 Esd. 3:12.—*Nathineans.* These were the posterity of the Gabaonites, whose office was to bring wood, water, &c. for the service of the temple. Ch. Jos. 9:27.—David and Solomon consigned others of the Chanaanites, whose lives they spared, to perform the same office. They were like public slaves. The number of those who returned was so small, that days were appointed for all the people to help to carry wood for the temple. At Jerusalem the Nathineans, “or people given,” resided on the east side of the city; (2 Esd. 2:2–6.) and other towns were assigned them. 1 Esd. 2:70. C.—The people continued to be divided into four classes, as they had been before the captivity. Malvenda.  
**3** *Manasses.* People from these tribes particularly, ( H.) as well as from others, had fled to the kingdom of Juda, when the Assyrians took their brethren prisoners; and these returned to Jerusalem. M.—Cyrus gave a general leave for all Israel to return. The country was too spacious for them; and it was found necessary to force the tenth part of the people, by lot, to repair to Jerusalem, as it wanted inhabitants. 2 Esd. 11:1.  
**4** *Ot* *hei;* perhaps Hathaia, son of Husias. The Heb. names are differently pronounced. C.  
**5** *Siloni* may mean a native of Silo, or a descendant of Sela. See Num. 26:20 and 2 Esd. 11:5. C.  
**7** *Oduia*, or Johed, or Juda. 2 Esd. 11 and 7:9. Junius.  
**11** *Azarias*, or Saraias, ib. 11.—*Mosollam*, or Sellum. C. 6:12. C.—*High* is not expressed in *Pontifex;* and this Azarias was only ( H.) one of the principal families; ( M. D.) perhaps the second in dignity; (4 K. 25:18) while Jesus was the successor of Aaron, 1 Esd. 3:8. C.—Heb. and Sept. “the ruler,” ( H.) or “captain of the guard of the house.” C.—They were styled pontiffs, or princes of the priests. T.  
**12** *Phassur*, Phesur, ( H.) or Phetur. From him sprung Zacharias, Amsi, Phelelia, Jehoram; so that the last was only the great-grandson of Phassur, 2 Esd. 11:12.—*Maasai.* In Esd. (v. 13) *Amassai, the son of Azreel, the son of Ahazi.*  
**14** *Levites*, established at Jerusalem.  
**15** *Carpenter.* Heb. Cheresh, is taken by some to be a surname. Sept. “And Ares.” It is asserted that the priests and Levites could follow no mechanical profession, (Abul.) and the Bacbacar only presided over the carpenters, who wrought in the temple. M. T.—But why might not people of this order employ themselves in such arts and labours, which were never deemed degrading among the Hebrews, nor incompatible with the sacred ministry, during the leisure hours? C.—S. Paul did not disdain to make tents. H.  
**16** *Suburbs*, or “courts,” *atriis* *.* H.—Heb. “villages.” M.—Netophati was a town of Juda. The ancient regulations could not be observed exactly. C.—The priests received the Levites into their cities. D.  
**17** *Sellum* had the superintendency over all the porters. H.—He was also at the head of one of the four bands which guarded the doors, east, west, north, and south of the temple, with various apartments, v. 26. C.—*Brother.* Heb. “brethren,” or bands. H.  
**18** *Time.* Heb. “and hitherto.” This custom has been observed at the king’s gate, who entered his tribune by the eastern gate of the temple. 4 K. 16:18. So far the ancient records reach. Some would infer from this passage, that a guard was still kept at the king’s gate, even though there was none sitting upon the throne after the captivity. C.—Prot. (“who hitherto *waited* in the king’s gate eastward.) They *were* porters in the companies of the children of Levi.” H.—These different bands attended by turns. M.—But the captains were on duty every day, v. 25, and 26, and 34.  
**19** *Service*, to keep watch. C.—*Families.* Heb. “fathers over the host, ( H.) or camp of the Lord: keepers of the entry.” The Corites, though not perhaps alone, performed what their fathers had done before the tabernacle, in the desert, and in the temple of Solomon; which were considered as the camp of the great king.  
**20** *Before.* Heb. “the Lord with him,” an usual form of blessing, ( C.) or of wishing well ( H.) to the deceased. C.—This Phinees lived after the captivity, ( M.) and possessed the same power as Eleazar and Joiada. C. 12:27, Num. 3:32. It is not necessary to refute the fables of the Rabbins, who pretend that the famous Phinees was an angel, who appeared at different times, and particularly at the return from Babylon. C.—Heb. may refer to the ancient Phinees: “And Phinees … was ruler over them formerly, and the Lord *was* with him.” D.  
**21** *Gate*, leading to the holy place, which corresponded with the tabernacle.  
**22** *Towns*, where they resided, when they were not on duty. M.—*Seer*, or prophet. H.—We read not of his making any such regulation. But he probably made it after the misconduct of the sons of Heli, and when the ark was brought back. C.—He might also give private instructions to David for the same purpose; ( H.) as Gad and Nathan did. 2 Par. 29:25. The same plans were still adopted, though the number of Levites was small. C.—*Trust*, while they were at the head of affairs, and acting by God’s authority. Lit. “in their faith;” ( H.) enlightened from above, and regulating matters according to the dispositions, which they discovered in the sacred ministers: or rather Heb. “in their established employment,” which was to subsist in future ages. C.  
**24** *Quarters:* lit. “by the four winds.”  
**25** *Up on.* Heb. “after seven days … with them,” to take their place for a week.  
**26** *To these.* Heb. “for these Levites, (Sellum, &c. v. 17) four chief porters *were* in their set office,” for life, or as long as they were able to serve, and did not change every week like the rest.—*Lord:* the apartments of the priests, and the storehouses, ( H.) where all precious ornaments, wine, &c. were kept. C.  
**30** *Priests.* They alone were allowed to make the composition, which no mortal was permitted to use ( C.) for his own pleasure. H. Ex. 30:34.  
**31** *Pan*, to be offered on the altar of holocausts, (Lev. 2:4 and 7:12) or to be eaten by the priests. Ezec. 46:20. Mathathias was to take care that all this was done with decency, ( C.) and to look after the utensils.  
**32** *Propositions.* Heb. “of arrangement;” (Ex. 35:13.) “of faces.” These loaves were made by the Levites, but arranged upon the golden table every week ( C.) before the ark. See C. 23:29.  
**33** *These;* probably Sellum, &c. (v. 17) though it is not certain that the chief porters presided over the singers. C. 15 and 16. Heb. “And these are the singers, chief of the families ( C. or fathers) of the Levites, in the chambers (of the temple) free” from all other avocations, ( H.) that they may watch over the porters and musicians. Sept. is clearer: ( C.) “And these are the masters of music over the bands of Levites, observing their daily courses, because *they are* day and night over them in the works.” H.—The sons of Caath seem to be chiefly specified, (v. 32) though other families sung. C. 6:39.—*Chambers*, at a distance from their wives, to trim the lamps in the evening, and to see that none were extinguished, ( M.) as also to teach music, &c. The Synagogues were used afterwards. D.  
**34** *Jerusalem*, having no substitute; (C. 26. H.) or the chiefs of each family resided there. M.  
**35** *And in.* These verses are repeated from the last chapter, in order to bring us to the death of Saul, ( M.) and the reign of David. C.—“Tis difficult to account for the repetition, provided they were repeated originally; but if they have been repeated through the blunder of a transcriber, the existence of the same words” before them may be the reason. Kennicott.—*The father of Gabaon.* This is the explanation of *Abigabaon.* C. 8:29. H.—*Wife.* So the former chapter, and all the ancient versions, with some Heb. MSS. read, instead of the printed Heb. “sister,” (Ken.) which seems to be corrupted; ( C.) and the Prot. venture to correct it. H.  
**41** *Tharaa.* Heb. “Tachrea.” Ken. *e*, is substituted for *a.* H.—*And Ahaz*, is omitted in Hebrew, (Ken.) and Sept.  
**42** *Jara.* Heb. Yahra instead of *Jeuade*, or Johada, ( C.) 8:36, twice. Sept. Jada here, and Joiada above. H.  
**43** *Raphaia*, called Rapha before. C.  
**44** *These. All* is omitted, though it is found C. 8:38, and in MS. ii. Kennicott.—These remarks, which may appear to some minute, shew that all Hebrew MSS. are not absolutely alike, as some once pretended; and that the Hebrew Bible is not printed from the best copies. H.—“The sacred volume in Hebrew has, therefore, been published with such carelessness, as no other printed copy with which I am acquainted.” Houbigant, prol. p. 2.—Yet this is the copy, which alone Protestants hold up as the standard of perfection, and the Rule of Faith! H.

## Chapter 10

**1** *Now.* Sept. “and.” H.—This has no connexion with what goes before. C.—This history is given more at large, 1 K. 31 and 2 K. 1. M.  
**3** *Reached:* lit. “found.” H.—Heb. “attacked him, and he feared the archers. He was not, at least, mortally wounded, when he took the desperate resolution to destroy himself, through fear and consternation. C. Yet the original will admit the sense of the Vulg. and Saul might have received some wounds. Sept. “Archers found him with bows, and in labours, and he laboured on account of (or to avoid) the bows.” H.  
**4** *Fear* and reverence for his master, ( C.) as well as concern for his own safety. H.  
**6** *Fell.* Heb. “died.” C.—But, though the house of Saul was fallen from its former glory, on this fatal day, when so many of his courtiers perished; yet he left Isboseth to bewail his fate, ( H.) and some others who were not of age to go to battle. C.  
**9** *To be.* Heb. “to carry tidings to their idols, (sorrows) and to the people.” They exposed the spoils in the temples, and gave thanks to their idols for the victory.  
**10** *Head*, while his body was hung on the walls of Bethsan. 1 K. 31:10. C.—The temple of Dagon was contiguous to the wall. D.  
**12** *Oak*, well known at Jabes. Elsewhere the word is translated, *the grove.* C.  
**13** *For.* Sept. “in his iniquities.” H.—See 1 K. 13:9 and 15:23. Saul offered sacrifice unlawfully, and spared some of the Amalecites. W.

## Chapter 11

**1** *David.* This name is written without *i*, in the books composed before the captivity, (A.C. 588) but *i* is inserted in the latter works, which is an argument against the antiquities of Canticles, where the *i* is found. Yet the MSS. vary so, that great stress is not laid on this (Kennicott) proof, and it is not sufficient weight to stand against the general opinion, which attributes that work to Solomon. H.—*Hebron*, after the death of Isboseth. 2 K. 5. C.—*Flesh;* related, as the children of Jacob.  
**3** *Which he spoke*, is not expressed in Heb. or Sept. Samuel complied with the injunction, by anointing David. 1 K. 16:13. He also wrote an account of this memorable transaction, which translated the sceptre from one family to another. H.—It is, on this account, that the author here takes particular notice of God’s decree. Ken.  
**5** *Here.* In 2 K. 5:6, the passage is much fuller, and attended with many difficulties. Kennicott would correct and translate it: “And they spake unto David, saying, Thou shalt not come hither: for the blind and the lame shall keep thee off, by saying David shall not come hither. But David took the stronghold of Sion,” (different from the citadel. Josephus) “which is the city of David. And David said, on that day, whosoever (first) smiteth the Jebusites, and, through the subterraneous passage, reacheth the blind and the lame, which are hated of David’s soul, because the blind and the lame continue to say, he shall not come into this house—shall be head and captain. So Joab, the son of Zeruiah, went up first, and was head.”  
**8** *Round.* He made a complete inclosure or fortification, as *Mello* denotes perfection, or completion, ( H.) by building houses from the castle to the town beneath it. David begun at the very house (or citadel, 4 K. 12:20) from which the blind and the lame thought to have excluded him, and built all round, so as to make an entire communication. Ken.—*Built.* Prot. “repaired.” Heb. yechaye, ( H.) “saved alive.” Syr. &c. Poole’s Synop. But probably *shear* is now written instead of *shor*, and *jeje* ought to be *jeje.* The long and the short *e* are easily confounded, ( H.) and *a* is frequently thus inserted. Watson.—“He built … round to the beginning of that circuit. And Joab was made governor of the city.” Ken.—“And surrounding it with a wall, he appointed Joab superintendant of the walls.” Joseph. vii. 3.—The position of the vowel points in these words, might naturally cause this mistake, ( H.) as it seems to have done on other occasions. Thus *shor*, “an ox,” should be sar, “a prince.” Gen. 49:6 and Osee 12:11. *Shevarim*, “oxen,” has been read sarim, “princes,” by the Sept. The former passage might admit of some corrections. “In their anger they slew the men, and in their fury (*vabrothom* *;* instead of *va* *brotsnom*, which is always explained in a good sense) they destroyed the princes. Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their fury, for it was inflexible.”  
**9** *Lord.* 2 K. adds *God*, more properly, as it seems always to have been inserted, thoug it is now wanting in two hundred places. Kennicott, Dis. i. p. 62 and 525.  
**10** *These.* Besides the help which David received immediately from God, he derived great assistance from Joab, the captain-general, from the six more renowned valiant men, and from the body of Thirty, as well as from fifteen others of less note, who are mentioned here. H.  
**11** *Number.* 2 K. 23:8. *the names.* But the two authors do not always use the same terms. Ken.—*Thirty*, or *three*, (2 K.) more correctly. D.—*Three*, ib. *eight;* ( H.) probably by mistake.—*Wounded*, or rather soldiers. He encountered singly a whole regiment, though he might not kill them all; much less did he attack them, when already wounded. Ken.—Numbers have often been expressed by letter in Heb. as well as in Greek and other languages. Our numeral figures are not liable to fewer mistakes. H.—Heb. “This is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, (the son of Zabdiel) the Hachmonite, chief of three. He lifted up his spear against three hundred soldiers at one time.” Ken.  
**12** *His.* Heb. “the son of Dodi.”  
**13** *And.* “Who could have discovered that thirty-four words are here omitted, if they had not been preserved in 2 K. 23.” though with some inaccuracy? We should read, “And when the men of Israel were fled, he arose and smote the Philistines, until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword. And the Lord wrought a great deliverance that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil. And after him was Shammah, the son of Agee, the Hararite: and the Philistines were gathered together at Lechi, where was a piece of ground full of barley … 14. But he placed himself in the midst of the field, (of barley) and saved it, and smote the Philistines; and the Lord wrought a great deliverance.” Ken.—The name of Samma must have been omitted by the transcriber. C.—Without it, how will the number 37 be made out?  
**14** *These men.* Sept. speak only of one: “And he stood,” &c. ( H.) and the verbs are singular. 2 K. 23:12.—*Gave.* Heb. vayahas (ibid.) is more correct than vayosha, “saved.” Ken.—Prot. are forced to add, “saved *them* by a great deliverance.” But there is nothing in the original signifying *by.* H.  
**15** *Captains.* This is not rightly expressed in any of the ancient versions, no more than in the Prot. which has, “Three of the Thirty chief;” marg. “Three captains over the Thirty.” The latter signification comes much nearer to the truth. It should be, “And there went down three captains, (Jesbaam, Eleazar, and Semma. H.) who were over Thirty.”—*Rock*, (hatsur) which seems preferable to *katsir*, “in the time of harvest.” 2 K. Ken. C.  
**16** *Garrison*, or advanced guard.  
**17** *O that.* Heb. “Who will.” David wished to see his native country freed from the troops of the Philistines.—*In.* Heb. “by the gate.”  
**18** *These.* Heb. “The three (or perhaps, *three of the mighty men*) brake through the host of the Philistines … by the gate, and took, and brought it to David. But David would not drink it; and he poured it out unto the Lord,” by way of prayer, (Ken.) or of thanksgiving. Josephus.  
**19** *In the.* Heb. “thing! Shall I drink the blood of these men, with their lives? for at the hazard of their lives they have brought it! And he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men,” (Ken.) forming the first ternary. T.—Among these heroes there were different degrees of excellence. C.—Prot. acknowledge the superlative, “mightiest:” but “mighty” would do better, as they were not still equal to Joab. H.  
**20** **Ve** **r.** **20** **.** *Abisai.* His name is written without the middle *i*, in all this book.—*Three.* Alex. Sept. alone reads, “six.”—*He was.* Heb. adds, “not;” evidently mistaking lo, “not,” for lo, “ei.” See 4 K. 8:10. “He lifted up his spear against 300 soldiers, and had a name among Three.” Ken.  
**21** *Second* and ( H.) *first* occur not in Heb. and Sept. C.—Heb. “Of the three he was more honourable than two; therefore he was their captain: and yet he attained not unto the first three.” Ken.—*First* is indeed the sense, but it is not expressed in the original. We have here the exact order of these mighty men sufficiently marked out. Abisai is the first captain ( H.) of the second ternary. T.  
**22** *Two ariels*. That is, two lions, or lion-like men; for ariel, in Hebrew, signifies “a lion ( Ch). of God,” the strongest compound word for “a man of valour. The courage of a lion is so singular, that a man of extraordinary heroism is frequently called a *lion*, by way of emphasis; and the word *God* is frequently applied in Scripture to things particularly great.” Kennicott.—*V* is wanting at the beginning and end of the name of Banaias, (here *Benaia*, instead of *Ubenaiahu* and Banaias, 2 K.) The last letter (v. 24) serves to distinguish this third captain in waiting on the king, from the eleventh, v. 31. C. 27:5 and 14. H.—Heb. “And Benaihu, the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, mighty in exploits; he slew two men of Moab, who were stouter than lions. He also went down and slew a lion in a pit, in a snowy day.” Ken.—We have observed, that “And” is not found in the printed Heb. nor is it in the Prot. “Benaiah … slew two lion-like men, of Moad.” Lit. “ariels;” (Sept.) that is, “lions of God,” or two of Moab *equal to* ( H.) the strongest lions. W.—Yet it is not certain whether these were not real lions, as well as the following. H.—S. Jerom translates, *two lions of Moab*, 2 K. 23:20. C.—*Lion: ari* is written arih, 2 K. H.  
**23** *Cubits.* 2 K. “a man of great aspect.”—*Ones.* Heb. “and he had a name among three mighty men.” Ken.—Shelosha, “three,” has the *u* omitted, (2 K.) as it is frequently on other occasions. H.  
**25** *Among*, or rather “above,” as he was the second captain of this series, and not one of the body of Thirty. Ken.—*Council.* Lit. “placed him at his ear,” ( H.) *fecit eum auricularium a secreto* *;* (2 K.) though the word is the same. C.—It seems, however, to have been read differently. H.—Sept. “he placed him over his family, ( C. πατριαν) or native place.” H.—Syr. “guard of his spear, and chief of his heroes.” Arab. “over all his riches.” Some would translate, “captain of his guards.” Grot.—Banaias was a man of consummate prudence, as well as a great warrior. C.—David “gives Banaias the command of his life-guard.” Joseph. 7:12.—Heb. “Behold! he was more honourable than the Thirty; but he attained not unto the first three, and David set him over his guard,” the Cerethites, &c. C. 18:17. Ken.—This author adopts the correction of Grotius, as the Prot. do; though he acknowledges there is not impropriety in the present reading, “over his hearing or obedience.” He also adds “first,” by way of explanation, as v. 21. H.  
**26** *Moreover.* Nothing particular is here recorded of Asahel, and therefore he is barely mentioned with the rest. But the Book of Kings had been more particular in determining their rank, and had said, “Asahel, brother of Joab, was over the Thirty,” being the last of the second ternary. The preposition *b* (Ken.) frequently means, “over.” Nold. &c.—Arab. “head of Thirty, whose names are these.” Ken.—*Elchanan;* probably the son of Jair. 2 K. 21:18. C.  
**27** *Arorite*, or Harodite, (2 K.) to distinguish him from Shammah. Eliza, who follows in 2 K. is here universally omitted, as he is supposed to have died soon, and to have been replaced by Zabad, (v. 41.) who completes the number of 30. Ken.—*Phalonite;* not Paltite, as 2 K. where *t* has been formed of the two letters *un.* So Sept. have read Adni, “my lord,” perhaps correctly, (Ken.) instead of Adan, “any man’s,” (1 K. 17:32) as the two letters might easily be mistaken for one. Ken.—Helles was the captain for the seventh month, as the following was for the sixth, and Abiezer for the ninth. C. 27:10. H.  
**29** *Sobbochai*, rather than Mobonnai, (2 K.) where *s* and *m* have been mistaken for *m* and *n*, which are very similar in Heb. The Sept. (Aldi) has there also Sabouchai. He was the eighth captain. C. 27.—*Ilai*, or Selmon. 2 K. Sept. have the same variation in some copies; but others lead us to suppose that Ilai was the true name. Neither occur any where else in Scripture.  
**30** *Maharai*, the tenth captain. (C. 27.) Heled was the twelfth.  
**31** *Ethai.* Not the famous prince of Geth, (2 K. 15:19. Ken.) though the name is written alike, (2 K. 23:29) an *i* being omitted. H.—This captain contributed to make David king (v. 10.)—*Banaia.* 2 K. 23 a *v* is added, which makes the name like that of the second general; (v. 22.) but it ought to form part of the *e*, which is wanting in the following word.  
**32** Hurai, rather than *Heddai*, (2 K. Ken.) though there is some doubt which is to be preferred. H.—Syr. and Arab. have Hiddai; but the Sept. declare for Hurai here, and the Aldine copy has Ouri also. 2 K. Ken.—*Torrent.* Heb. “of the torrents *or vales* of Gaas.” C.—*Abiel.* 2 K. *Abailbon*, which seems to be the right word, as a transcriber may omit letters more easily than he can insert them. *Bun* and the end seems to have been written separate, and to have been translated “the son of,” by Syr. and Arab. The particles al and ál, have also been frequently mistaken on account of their nearly similar pronunciation.—Bauramite. Heb. habacharumi, 2 K. habarchumi, where two letters are transposed, and *v* is omitted, as usual, in the latter book. H.—The former reading appears to be more correct, as the hero probably came from Bahurim, (bérim, 2 K. 3:16) and the Syr. and Arab. seem to have read correctly.—*Salabonite.* Sept. Σαλαβωνιτης (2 K.) Σαλαβωνι. Ken.—The translator of the latter book gives the Hebrew termination throughout, instead of the Greek; ( H.) “whence the learned have drawn an unanswerable argument against that version’s being the work of the same author.” Ken.—They might as well prove that S. Jerom did not translate both these books. H.  
**33** *Gezonite.* We know not the meaning of this epithet. C.—In 2 K. we read *of the sons of Jassen, Jonathan, and Se* *mma;* (K.) but both seem to be incorrect; instead of Sept. “the son,” or supposing *m* to be lost, at the beginning, “of the sons of Assem, Gouni,” as Sept. read, instead of *Genonite*, which would leave this hero without any name. See C. 5:15. E is prefixed to this name, as it is to that of Manasses. Jos. 1:12.—*Sage*, should be Shamha, (Ken.) or *Jonathan, the son of Samaa*, the brother of David. He slew the monstrous giant, (C. 20:7) as Sabachai did another. Jonathan is mentioned also along with Asahel (2 K. 21) so that he deserves a place here among David’s heroes.  
**34** *Sachar*, mentioned C. 26:4.  
**35** *Eliphal* should be *Eliphelet, the son of Aasgai, the son of Machati*, ( H.) or of the country of Maacha, 4 K. 25:23. Ken.—*Eliphal* and *Hepher* cannot constitute two heroes, as that would derange the number 37. 2 K. 23:39. The copies of the Sept. vary much. H.  
**36** *Ahia*, or rather “Eliam, the son of Achitophel, the Gilonite,” 2 K. The name of the hero is lost here; and the latter part of his father’s name (*p*) has also been mistaken for *g*, which it resembles.  
**37** *Hesro* ends with *u* in the Heb. Yet some read more properly with *i*, “Hetzrai,” as all the ancient versions have it, except the Vulg. (Ken.) some copies of which read Asra. Blanchini, Vind. 1740.—*Carmelite.* Sept. καρμηδι. The Δ might easily be mistaken for Λ, as the Greek bibles (Ken.) for some ages after Origen were written in capital letters, without accents. Montfaucon, Pref. to Hexap. p. 44.—*Azbai* seems preferable to *Arbi*, as the proper name seems also more correct than *Pharai.* 2 K. H.—The Vat. Sept. confounds both words in one “Ouraiverchi.” We may apply to many of the proper names that severe censure which S. Jerom has passed upon the transcribers of the book of Chronicles. *Ita in Græcis & Latinis cod: hic* *nominum liber vitiosus est, ut non tam Hebræa quam Barbara quædam & Sarmatica nomina conjecta arbitrandum eit*, &c. ep. ad Domn. If this epistle be not genuine, the same doctor complains at least of the incorrect state of the Sept. Pref. in Paral.  
**38** *Joel* seems better than Igaal, (2 K. H.) as we know there were some of this name under David, (C. 26:22 and 27:20) and all the versions agree here, but vary much 2 K. It is, therefore, more natural for us to adhere to that copy which has the greatest authority from the ancient versions. Ken.—*Brother*, relation, adopted child, ( D.) or *son*, (2 K.) which seems more correct, as this is an usual expression. C.—This reason may rather lead us to conclude that the mistake being more natural, has been made by the transcriber of that book; particularly as we no where else read of Joel being the son of Nathan, but rather of Pedaiah, &c.—*Mibahar*, or rather “Nathan of Tzoba.”—*The son*, ought to be the proper name, “Bonni, (of Gadi. 2 K.) or the Gadite.” Ken.  
**41** *Zabad.* This name, with the following, is not found 2 K. where Elica occurs, though not mentioned here. C.—We have observed that Zabad took his place, and completed the number 37, v. 27.  
**42** *With him.* Heb. “above him,” (Sept. Jun. Mont.) which must be applied to the rest of these 15 less valiant men. Ken.—Prot. agree with the Vulg. ( H.) and Delany looks upon these 30 as a forth order of commanders in chief. But 30 with him would take 31, and why are only 15 mentioned? We have a regular gradation of officers, descending from Joab, the captain general. Ken.—These heroes are supplementary to those in the Book of Kings, and were stationed ( C.) on the east of the Jordan, ( D.) in their native country; ( C.) which is true, at least ( H.) with respect to several of them. Maacha, Aashtaroth, and Aroer were in these parts, (Jos. 13:9, 13. Ken.) as well as Mathana. Num. 21:18. C.  
**44** *Jehiel.* The Masorets read so in the margin; but in the text they substitute *u* for *i*, improperly. See Sept. and C. 5:7, 8.  
**45** *Samri.* Prot. “Shimri,” or margin, “the Shimrite,” as they deem the expression to be equivalent. But Shimri was rather the father of Jedihel or Jediael, and Joha.  
**46** *Mahumite.* Prot. “Mahavite.” Kennicott would translate these last verses according to his corrections. 42 … “Zabad, the son of Ahlai; (43) Adina, the son of Shiza, the Reubenite, and head of the Reubenites: But the thirty were his superiors. 44 Hanan, the son of Maacha; and Josaphat, the Mithnite. 45 Urzia, the Ashtarothite; Shema and Jehiel, the sons of Hotham, the Aroerite. 46 Jediel, the son of Shimri; and Joha, his brother, the Titzite. 47 Jeliel and Mahavite, and Jeribai and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam; and Ithmah, the Moabite; (48) Eliel, and Obed and Jashiel, the Metzobaites.” It will be easily perceived that this author frequently recedes from the Prot. version, as well as from the printed Heb. both of which are frequently erroneous. Perhaps the critical examination of these proper names, may appear to some unimportant. But the question respecting the perfect integrity of the Hebrew text deserves to be seriously considered; and every part of sacred history requires our attention. If the Prot. rule of faith be incorrect, what security can they have? We are not exposed to the same inconvenience, even though the Vulgate be susceptible of farther improvement. H.

## Chapter 12

**1** *Siceleg*, which had been given to David for a retreat. Hither many brave men came to join him.—*Fled.* Heb. “was shut up through fear.” C.—Sept. “was under anxiety.” H.  
**2** *Hand*, like Aod. Judg. 3:15. M.—*Brethren*, of the same tribe. The opinion which they entertained of David, must have been very great, to make them expose themselves to such dangers. In adversity, true friendship and virtue shine the most. C.—The hand of providence is here conspicuous. T.  
**4** *Thirty.* Heb. sheloshim, denotes “the officers” of the army. C.—Prot. style this hero “Ismaiah.”  
**6** *Jesbaam.* Probably the second after Joab. C. 11:11. H.—*Of Carehim.* Heb. “the Korhites.” Ken.—So also the Sept. There were Levites, descendants of Core. M.  
**8** *Gaddi*, a city of the tribe of Gad, (2 K. 23) from which many went to join David, when he was in the country of Moab, ( M.) as others of the Gadites did, v. 14.—*Mountains.* A fierce countenance and swiftness were much commended in soldiers. “The eyes are always first conquered.” *Primi in omnibus præliis oculi vincuntur*, says Tacitus, Mor. Germ. C. See Prov. 30:30, 2 K. 2:18. M.  
**14** *Thousand*, after David had ascended the throne. C.—At Siceleg he had only 600. M.—Some suppose that each of these officers was worth 100 men, &c. Vatab.  
**15** *Month*, Nisan. T.—*Banks.* This circumstance enhances their courage. Maundrel (Alep. p. 136) went to see the Jordan, 13th March, 1697, but the river was nine feet from the banks. Its rapidity has perhaps made its bed so much deeper, that it does not overflow so frequently at present. C.  
**16** *Hold*, in Moab, (1 K. 22:4. D. M.) or to Siceleg. The people of *Benjamin* come with those of *Juda*, to avoid suspicion. C.  
**17** *Hands.* At that time he had done no injury to any man. H.  
**18** *S* *pirit* of God ( C. or good will. D.) prompted Amasai, the chief of “the officers.” C.—*Band*, or “of a company.” H.  
**19** *Fight.* They joined him after he had left the Philistines. C.—*But he.* Heb. “they helped them not.” Neither David nor his partizans were involved in this danger, which might have caused their fidelity to be suspected. 1 K. 29. H.  
**20** *Thousands:* heads of the principal cities. Mic. 5:2. D.  
**21** *Rovers* of Amalec, 1 K. 30:1.  
**22** *Of God;* very great, ( C.) particularly when Isboseth was slain 2 K. 5:1. H.—The angels are to us innumerable, Job 25. An army in concord is compared to them. W.  
**27** *Joiada* had the post of Eleazar over the Levites, (Num. 3:32) and was at the head of the warriors of his tribe, while Abiathar was high priest. C.  
**28** *Of excellent.* Heb. “of great valour.” Saul had appointed him in the place of Achimelec, and David permitted him to retain his dignity.  
**29** *Followed.* Heb. “kept guard at the palace.” These guards submitted to David, like the rest, after the death of Isboseth. C.  
**31** *Manasses*, west of the Jordan. See v. 37. H.  
**32** *Should*, in agricultural pursuits, in which those of Issachar excelled. Gen. 49:14. Countrymen have often more skill about the weather, then the greatest astronomers, Virg. Georg. i. M. T.—Others think that these men could calculate when the festivals would occur, (S. Jer. Trad.) or they were well versed in politics, &c. See Est. 1:13.  
**40** *Nephthali.* All, both far and near, contributed to regale the deputies. C.

## Chapter 13

**1** *Consulted.* David wished to give religion due splendour and authority, in his dominions; and he prudently contrives to obtain the general consent. H.—“Where there is no liberty, there is no religion;” and no change in religious matters should be attempted, without the consent of the Church. C.  
**2** *To us.* In the first assembly, David’s motion was adopted, and a more general meeting, particularly of the priests, was convoked. H.  
**3** *Sought.* Prot. “inquired not at it.” Yet it is certain that many resorted to the ark, at that time. But is was not treated with such honours as David now wished. H.  
**5** Emath, from “the troubled river” Nile, (Jos. 13:3. C.) or Rhinocorura, ( T. M.) to the northern extremities of the promised land, ( H.) near Emesa.  
**6** *Hill.* Heb. “to Baalah,” which was another name, as well as “Baslim,” for Cariathiarim. 1 K. 7:2. C.  
**7** *Brother.* Heb. “Acho,” which has the same meaning. T.—Sept. Syr. &c. “his brethren.” C.  
**9** *Ch* *idon.* Alias, Nachon. Ch. 2 K. 6.—He had perhaps two names. D.—Syr. and Arab. “of Ramim.” C.—*The ox.* Prot. “the oxen stumbled.”  
**11** *Divided.* Slain. See C. 14:11, 1 K. 15:32 and 2 K. 6:7. H.—The soul of brutes perishes; that of man is only divided from the body by death.  
**13** *Obededom.* A Levite was judged more proper to guard the ark. C. 15:18.—*Gethite.* Because he had dwelt in Geth. W.

## Chapter 14

**1** *Hiram.* This embassy, and the war with the Philistines, took place before the ark was removed. C.  
**2** *Perceived*, by divine revelation, or by his constant success, ( M.) as well as by the presents of “the king of Tyre, and the unanimity” of all the people. D.—*Over his.* Heb. and Sept. on account of his people. Kings are more for their subjects than for themselves. C.  
**5** **Ver** **.** **5** **.** *Eliphalet and Noga* are not mentioned. 2 K. 6:15. C. See C. 3:9. H.  
**7** *Baaliada*, probably the same with Eliada. C.  
**8** *Seek him*, with a design to oppress him, before his throne was established. H.  
**11** *Baalpharasim*, “the god *or* master of divisions.” C.—The place was so called afterwards. D.  
**12** *Burnt*, conformably to Deut. 7:25. These idols were commonly made of wood, and covered with plates of gold, &c. The Philistines took them along with them to battle, as the Hebrews carried the ark on many occasions. The Greeks, at the siege of Troy, had their gods on board their vessels; (Iliad ix.) and the Romans had theirs on their ensigns, in their wars.  
**14** *Pear* or mulberry trees, (2 K. 5:23. C.) on the side where the idols were. T.  
**15** *Tops*, or on the height. God sent an invisible army to David’s assistance.  
**16** *Gazera*, on the borders of the Philistines, near Azotus. C.  
**17** *All countries and nations*, in the vicinity. H.

## Chapter 15

**1** *Houses*, or magnificent palaces, which afterwards caused him to be ashamed, seeing the ark was lodged under skins. 2 K. 7:10.—*For it*, entirely new. The old tabernacle was left at Gabaon. C. D.  
**2** *Levites*, of the family of Caath, v. 13, Num. 4:5. He was rendered more cautious by the death of Oza. C.—*For ever*, as long as this law subsists. H.  
**5** *Brethren.* Relations. D.  
**8** *Elisaphan*, a Caathite, (Ex. 6:18, 22) as well as Hebron and Oziel. C.—Perhaps Caath was also called by the first name. D.  
**12** *Sanctified.* Free from every legal uncleanness, continent, and washed. C.  
**13** *Struck us.* He partakes in the misfortune of Oza. H.—*The law* through ignorance. You must attend and give proper directions. M.—Heb. “because we did not seek him with judgment,” ( D.) or, “after the due order.” Prot.  
**17** *Heman, Asaph*, and *Ethan* were masters of the first band of musicians, in the reign of David. They played on the cymbals of brass, v. 19.  
**18** *Ben.* His name is omitted, v. 20, and in the Sept. The Syriac, &c. have “the son of Jaziel:” but we find the 9th Psalm addressed “to Ben, chief of the hand of young women,” who sung and played on nables, v. 20. C.—*And Jaziel*, called Oziel, v. 20, as the Sept. have here. H.  
**20** *Zacharias*, &c. presided over the second band, with nables, and *Mathathias* over the third, which had instruments of eight strings. The priests sounded the trumpets, (v. 24.) which Chonenias directed all the music, in this solemn processions. C.—*Psalteries.* Lit. “nables.” H.—The Vulg. sometimes renders it psalterion, at other times lyra, ( M.) or symphonia. S. Jer. ad Dard. T.—Some have supposed that the word denotes bagpipes; but it was a stringed instrument made of wood. C.—Heb. “with nebalim over halamoth,” concerted things, or virgins, (Ps. 67:26) who sung the mysterious words of God. H.  
**21** *Ozaziu* does not occur before. Sept. have Ozias both here and v. 18, after Jehiel. H.—*Of victory*, such as was customary on the like occasions.—*For the octave.* Heb. hasheminith, according to the Jews, means an instrument of eight strings; so when *ten* is mentioned, the Sept. frequently supply “strings.” Ps. 32:2. M.—Heb. “they had guitars, and presided over the eighth band to intone. All the bands formed four choirs, distinguished by their instruments, the cymbal, nable, *cinnor*, (or guitar) and trumpets. C.  
**22** *The prophecy.* Singing praises to God is here called *prophecy:* the more, because these singers were often inspired men. Ch.—Heb. Massa signifies a song, ( H.) elevation, ( C.) burden. Syr. So the Vulg. has *onus Moab*, &c. the burden or dreadful prediction against Moab. C.—Prophecy often denotes no more than a melodious canticle. 1 K. 10:10. H.—Chonenias directed all this music. Sept. simply style him “prince of the Levites, prince of the musicians” ( C.) or αρχων των ωδων (who gave out the songs) “because he was intelligent.” H.  
**24** *Jehias* is called Jehiel, v. 18 and 21. He, Obededom, Barachias, and Elcana, (v. 23.) were probably the four chief porters who attended the ark in arms; and others were, afterwards, stationed at the temple. C. 9:17. The two former took part also in the music, v. 21. C.—Perhaps two preceded and two went behind the ark, to keep off the crowd. M.  
**26** *Rams*, in thanksgiving, that they had not been treated like Oza. C.—The Jews pretend that the ark was no burden to the Levites. T.—Love makes all duties easy. H.  
**27** *Linen.* Heb. “a cloak of byssus,” or of the finest white linen. D.—Bysus has often occurred before in the Vulg. but we find the Heb. buts, here for the first time. It probably denotes the brilliant yellow silk taken from the fish pinna, of which S. Basil speaks. Hexa. vii. Justinian was clothed with it, on account of its rarity and brightness. Procop. de fabric. Yet as it would hardly assume any colour but black, it was not so much sought after as the silk of Persia. Not only David, but all the Levites, were thus richly adorned; as the latter were at the dedication of the temple. 2 Par. 2:14. There was a manufactory of this byssus established by David. C. 4:21. That of Egypt was white, and is called schesch, or “cotton.” Ex. 16:4. C.—*Ephod.* Sept. “a stole of byssus,” or a long silken robe, ( H.) which has been already expressed; ( T.) or rather, the ephod was only a girdle, which was not peculiar to the sacred ministers. 1 K. 2:18. C.—Samuel, though a child, wore one. W.  
**29** *Heart*, and reproached him for appearing without his regal ornaments, ( H. 2 K. 6:20) as if he had been naked. No reproach could have been more unfounded, as we see David had on a robe of byssus, with the ephod. C.

## Chapter 16

**2** *Lord*, wishing them all felicity, and making them presents, like the master of a family, v. 43, and 2 K. 6:18. C.—Any superior may bless. W.  
**3** *Oil.* The precise signification of the Heb. Ashisha, is not known. C.—Prot. “a flagon *of wine.*” H.—It denotes any thing “exhilarating.” T. D.  
**4** *Appointed*, as a prophet, ( H.) or by dispensation. The high priest has supreme spiritual power. Deut. 17:18. &c. W.  
**5** *Zacharias*, at the head of the second band. These played on the nable and kinnor, as the women did not sing in the tabernacle. *Jahiel* should be Oziel, (C. 15:18, &c. C.) unless he be the same person. C. 15:18. H.—*Instruments.* Lit. “organs.” H.—Heb. “the instruments of nables.” Vat. M.  
**6** *Jaziel.* We read Eliezer, &c. C. 15:24.—*Continually.* At the appointed times.  
**7** *Made.* Heb. “gave first, to thank the Lord, into the hand of Asaph and his brethren *this psalm*,” ( H.) in order the 104th; and from v. 23 we find the 95th in the Psalter, with some improvements. T.  
**11** *Power.* The ark was frequently the instrument of God’s power; and his people are exhorted to present themselves to pray before it. C.—God seemed to dwell there, and often displayed his wonders. D.  
**13** *Israel.* In Ps. 104. *Abraham.*  
**22** *Prophets.* The ancient patriarchs ruled their families as kings, and directed them by word and example, like the most holy prophets. C.—Both are frequently styled *anointed.* H.  
**27** *Place.* In Ps. 95:6. *holiness and majesty in his sanctuary.* Heb. “strength and beauty in,” &c. God is served in his tabernacle with piety.  
**29** **9** **.** *Sacrifice*, of flour and wine.—*Beauty.* Heb. “in the beauty of his sanctuary.” Ps. *Come into his courts: adore ye the Lord in his holy court.*  
**30** *Presence.* Here the psalm adds, *say ye among*, as v. 31.  
**35** *And say*, &c. is not in the psalm; and it seems not to agree with the flourishing state of David’s kingdom: yet he might speak with the spirit of prophecy, or with that all his subjects might live in happiness and concord under him. C.—Others think that Esdras inserted these verses to be sung in the second temple, (Lyran. E.) when many still remained in captivity. Yet them may refer to the time of Christ. D.  
**36** *And* sing. Heb. “and Alleluia,” or, “all … said, (or shall say) truth and praise be to the Lord.”  
**39** *Sadoc* was to minister at Gabaon, with Heman, Idithun, &c. while Abiathar, Asaph, &c. officiated at Jerusalem. C.—This regulation continued till towards the end of David’s reign, ( H.) when fresh orders were given. C. 23. &c. We find Abiathar and Sadoc were both at Jerusalem, when David was obliged to flee. 2 K. 15:24 and 3 K. 1:7. The altar at Gabaon continued some time longer. 3 K. 3:3.  
**43** *Bless*, or feast, ( D.) with his family, on part of the sacred victims. H.

## Chapter 17

**1** *Cedar.* Such were esteemed the most magnificent, v. 6. See 2 K. 7.  
**9** *A place* permanent and secure, while I have had no fixed abode. C.—*No more*, for a long time: and unless they provoke me by their crimes, as they did afterwards, and were exposed to more severe chastisements. Constant rest is not always expedient. T.  
**11** *Seed*, even till Christ shall be born of the Blessed Virgin, of the family of David.  
**12** *Ever* often means only a long duration. The dominion of Christ shall have no end. C.—The Church founded by this true David, ( H.) falls heir to these promises. D.  
**13** *Thee.* The posterity of Saul lost the throne. H.—If Solomon was reprobated, his children were permitted to reign. It is also presumed that he did penance; though this is not certain.  
**17** *Men.* Who was ever more favoured by God than David? Heb. “Thou hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree.” Prot. H.  
**18** *Known him.* Treating him with love and tenderness, as a friend. How can David sufficiently testify his gratitude?  
**21** *Himself.* Heb. adds, “and to make thee a name.”  
**27** *Begun.* Heb. “be pleased, ( H.) or thou hast had the goodness to bless.” Syr. “I pray thee bless.”

## Chapter 18

**1** *Daughters.* Villages (See 2 K. 8:1. M.) and dependant towns. W.  
**2** *Gifts.* Heb. mincha, a word used to denote the offerings of bread, &c. Lev. 2. Here it signifies the tribute ( C.) imposed on the conquered. H.  
**3** *Adarezer*, or Adadezer, 2 K.—*When he*, the king of Soba, *went to extend.* Heb. “to strengthened his hand on the,” &c.—*Hand* often denotes power, extent, possession.  
**4** *Footmen.* Heb. may well signify, “1000 chariot-horses and 7000 men who mounted the chariots and the horses.” We only find 1700 horsemen. 2 K. 8:4. But soon after it is added, David *hou* *ghed all the chariot-horses.* C.—They were thus rendered useless. The king was forbidden to keep many horses. D.  
**5** *Damascus.* Heb. “Aram of Darmesek.” Elsewhere the *r* is omitted.  
**6** *A garriso* *n.* Lit. “soldiers.” This word has been lost by the neglect of some Heb. transcriber. C.—Prot. supply it. H.  
**7** *Quivers.* Heb. “the shields,” &c. The term is variously translated, 2 K.  
**8** *Chun*, called probably Betath, and Berothai. 2 K.  
**10** *Adoram*, or Joram, ib.—*Desire.* Heb. “to ask if all went well with him, and to bless him.  
**11** Edom, or rather Syria, (Aram) which might easily be exchanged for Edom. 2 K. 8. David could not satisfy his devotion by building a temple; but he made preparations. Solomon left part of the treasures unconsumed, 1 Par. 26:26. C.—These effects, being destined for sacred uses, are said to be consecrated to the Lord. W.  
**12** *Edomites.* David seems to have been present, and the victory is sometimes attributed to him. Joab afterwards slew 18,000. 3 K. 11:15 title of Ps. 9. S. Jer. Trad. C.—*Pits.* This place was fatal to that nation: there Amasias destroyed 20,000, 2 Par. 25:12. T.  
**16** *Abiathar* and *Achimelech* had both names indifferently. Heb. reads Abimelech, which is a manifest mistake. The name of Abiathar perhaps ought to be in the place of Achimelech; as we know that he was the son of the latter, and the high priest under David. Some would translate, “and Abiathar, son of Achimelech.”—*Susa*, or *Saraias*, secretary.  
**17** *About.* Lit. “at the hand of the king,” to execute his orders, and to assist him. Sept. “vicegerents.” Syr. “princes.” They are styled *priests.* 2 K. 8:18.

## Chapter 19

**3** *Land*, or city, 2 K. 10:3. C.—What evils proceed from evil counsellors!  
**4** *From.* Heb. “in the midst, above the thighs:” exposing them to derision. H.  
**6** *Done.* Heb. “made themselves stinking.” Sept. “that the people of David were covered with confusion.” The insult fell on all Israel.—*Mesopotamia* is not mentioned 2 K. as the troops perhaps did not arrive soon enough for the first battle, v. 16.  
**7** *Chariots.* This number seems excessive, and it may have been put for infantry; the number of which, specified 2 K. was 33,000. But the troops of Mesopotamia are not there mentioned, and this supplies what was left defective. C.—The chariots may signify those who fought upon them, ( M.) v. 18, Isai. 21:7. T.—Sometimes the whole number is specified; at others only a part.  
**16** *River*, in Mesopotamia. Joab did not allow them time to arrive.—*Sophach*, or Sobac. Adarezer sent also to collect these forces. 2 K.  
**18** *Chariots.* Lit. “chariot.” 2 K. has only 700, and 40,000 *horsemen.* C.—Ten men might be in each chariot. D.  
**19** *Went.* Heb. “made peace with David.” The many petty kings who had hitherto been tributary to Adarezer, submitted now to the conqueror. C.

## Chapter 20

**1** *Year.* Heb. “at the return of the year,” in spring. C.  
**2** *Melchom.* Sept. add the explanation, “their king.” It may also be referred to the idol of Ammon. H.—The massy crown was suspended over David’s head. T. D.  
**3** *Harrows.* Heb. “cut *them* with saws, and with harrows; ( H.) *or*, rollers of iron, and with saws.” But some other term was probably used, as we find saws before. C.—Prot. have “axes.” This exemplary punishment was in consequence of the violation of the law of nations. Abulensis pronounced it lawful. Tirin accuses David of a grievous sin of cruelty; observing that he was at this time involved in the sin of adultery: and people easily fall from one abyss into another. Cruelty and lust often go together. Yet it seems best to suspend our judgment. H.—David might only treat the most guilty in this manner. D.  
**4** *Gazer*, which seems preferable to Gob. 2 K. 21:18.  
**5** *Adeodatus.* Heb. “Elchanan, the son of Jair, of Lehem;” or, “slew Lechemi, brother of Goliath;” or equal to him in strength. C.—*Brother* is here supplied, as it is wanting. 2 K. D.  
**7** *Rapha*, head of the giants of Palestine. C.

## Chapter 21

**1** Satan*.* This shews that the Lord only ( H.) permitted David’s sin, (2 K. 24. W.) and in this sense only he is said to have instigated him; ( D.) though we read this was done by the fury of the Lord, or by an evil spirit. H.  
**3** *Israel*, who will be severely punished. C.—Sin is often used in this sense. Vatable.  
**5** *The number*, &c. The difference of the numbers here and 2 K. 24:9 is to be accounted for, by supposing the greater number to be that which was really found, and the lesser to be that which Joab gave in; ( Ch.) or the transcribers of this place have been inaccurate. C.  
**6** *Number.* These might therefore escape the pestilence. D.—*For.* Heb. “because the king’s word was abominable to Joab.” We read that Benjamin was numbered unto David. C. 7:5, 11. But that might be on another occasion; or the register continued in the archives, and was not brought to the king. See C. 27:24. C.  
**8** *Iniquity.* David was guilty, though he retained both faith and hope. W.  
**9** *Seer*, or prophet, whom David kept at court and consulted. He was endued himself with the prophetic spirit.  
**10** *Three;* a word omitted in Heb. but supplied by the Prot. H.—“I will bring three things upon thee.” Sept.  
**12** *Three years’ famine;* which joined with the three foregoing years of famine, mentioned 2 K. 21 and the seventh year of the land’s resting, would make up the seven years proposed by the prophet. 2 K. 24:13. Ch.—Perhaps it would be as well to acknowledge a mistake, (2 K. H.) on account of the similitude of the Hebrew words signifying three and seven: ( T.) unless the prophet reduced the time from seven to three years; as in Ezechiel (4:15.) God mitigates the severity of his first threat. Sanctius.  
**13** *Men.* Susanna spoke on a different supposition, (Dan. 13:23, Eccli. 2:22) of eternal punishment, in consequence of sin. David prefers to be punished by the hand of a tender father, rather than that of an enemy; ( T. E.) and he does not wish to screen himself from suffering in this world, but offers himself to share in the chastisement of his subjects. H.  
**15** *Took.* Heb. “repented of evil,” taking pity of unhappy victims.—*Ornan*, or Areuna. Ch.—He had been *king* of the Jebusites before David took Jerusalem. Mariana. T.  
**18** *Altar.* Hence it appears that holy men erected altars by God’s command. D.  
**20** *Now.* Heb. “and Oranan turned back.”—*Angel.* Sept. (Vat.) “the king and his four sons with him, along with Achabin.” Other editions have, “and his four sons hidden with him.” Arab. “and the king, being come near to Aran, he saw David and his,” &c. Syr. reads in like manner; but says nothing of the children either of David or of Ornan. We do not read that Ornan saw the angel, 2 K. but this circumstance may be here supplied. It is evident the Sept. have read melec, “king,” instead of *malac*, “angel.” C.—Eupolemus says the angel Dianathan shewed David were to build the temple. Eus. Præp. ix. 30.  
**22** *Worth.* Heb. “give it me for the full price,” or “worth.” Sept. “the money was weighed.”  
**25** *Six hundred sicles*, &c. This was the price of the whole place on which the temple was afterwards built: but the price of the oxen was fifty sicles of silver. 2 K. 24:24. Ch.—Or the fifty sicles were given for the threshing-floor alone. C. D.  
**26** *Fire*, to testify his approbation. ( W. T.) See Gen. 4:4, 2 Par. 7:1. C.—This altar represented the cross, on which the Victim of our reconciliation was offered. D.  
**30** *God.* He performed what God had commanded. But he would have offered other voluntary victims at Gabaon, if he had been able. C.—The distance shewed the propriety of building the temple at Jerusalem, ( D.) which was nearly in the centre of the country. H.

## Chapter 22

**1** *The house.* Or the place where the temple shall be built. M.—The miraculous fire convinced David that God had made choice of this spot.  
**2** *Proselytes.* This is the first time that the word occurs in the Vulg. See Ex. 12:45. It means “strangers,” ( C.) who were not allowed to live in the country, unless they would observe the natural law, and renounce idolatry. Rabbins.—These had embraced the Jewish religion. M.—They were the remnants of the people of Chanaan, (3 K. 9:20,) and were treated as public slaves, which could not have been done, with justice or policy, with regard to those who might barely wish to reside in the country. These strangers prefigured the Gentiles, chosen to build the Christian Church.  
**3** *Prepared.* Syr. and Arab. “appointed blacksmiths from among the proselytes, to forge tools for cutting and dressing stone, &c.” But most follow the Vulg. C.—*Closures* is explained by the following word, which alone occurs in Heb. &c.—*Immense.* Heb. and Sept. “abundance, *it was* not weighed.” H.  
**4** *Number.* Still we find that Solomon ordered more, as the structure was more magnificent than even David had imagined.  
**6** *Tender*, (*delicatus*) weak and unexperienced. C.—Yet he might be 21 when he was crowned. T.—David began his preparations long before.—*Lord.* Heb. “*must be* ( H.) for grandeur, excellence, fame, and beauty, through all countries” a sort of prodigy.—*All.* Heb. “abundantly.”  
**8** *Blood*, of Urias, (S. Jer. and the Rab.) or rather, as David had already entertained the desire of building a temple before that event, ( E.) the blood which David had shed in just wars, must be understood; as even that causes a person to be regarded as unclean. The soldiers were obliged to be purified before they could enter the camp. Num. 31:19. In the Christian Church, those are deemed irregular who have contributed to the death of the guilty, even as judges or witnesses. The Pagans entertained the like sentiments. C. Æneas dares not touch the sacred vessels and household gods, when he was stained with blood, shed in his country’s defence.  
**9** *Peaceable.* Heb. “Solomon,” which has this meaning. C.—Herein Solomon was a figure of Christ, who is styled the Prince of peace. Isai. 9. W.  
**10** *Name.* See 2 K. 7:13. M.—*A son.* The crimes into which Solomon fell, hinder us from explaining this literally of him. S. Paul refers the expression to Jesus Christ. Heb. 1:5. C.—S. Aug. (de C. xvii. 8 and 9.) observes that the promises were not perfectly fulfilled in Solomon.  
**12** *Understanding*, (*sensum* *.*) Skill to resolve difficult questions. M.—*That.* Heb. “and appoint thee to rule.” H.  
**14** *Poverty.* Prot. “trouble.” H.—David confesses that the immense sums which he had collected, were nothing in comparison with the greatness of God. He left more than was sufficient for Solomon to perfect the work, with still greater magnificence than he had planned out, v. 5. C. 28:2 and 29:2. &c. C.—*Million.* Josephus (vii. 14) reduces these sums to one tenth part, “of gold 10,000 talents, of silver 100,000;” so that it is “extremely probable that a *cipher*” was added to these numbers, in some very ancient Heb. copy. Brerewood computes that the sum mentioned here and C. 29:4, would amount to 841,125,000*l.* and maintains that the whole temple pavement, and all the vessels, might have been made of solid gold, without consuming it all. De pond, in Walton’s Polyglot.—“If we take the preceding talents according to bishop Cumberland’s computation, the sum total will be somewhat less: but, were we to reduce it to less than one-half, would not the sum of four hundred millions of money be immense and incredible?” Kennicott.—A learned Jew has written this marginal note in his Bible, 1661: “It is supposed, these talents are not to be reckoned like the Mosaic, for they would amount to 720 millions. But as the Scripture makes no difference, we have no other computation to go by.” See Ken. diss. ii. If they were the same, the sum would exceed belief. Some have thought that they were only half. Mariana supposes the talents were only the weight of sicles, or four drachms; so that David left one million for the fabric. D.—But the relation given by historians of the riches of Sardanapalus, Cyrus, Alexander, Atabalipa, and some kings, who were not more likely to amass such treasures than David, make the account less improbable. Josephus (7:12) asserts, that “no prince ever left so great riches.” He had extended his dominions on all sides, and imposed tribute on the conquered. He was very frugal, and had possession of the mines of Phunon, (Num. 21:10 and 33:43) and of Phœnicia. Deut. 33:25. Though the talent seems to have varied in other nations, it always consisted of 3000 sicles among the Hebrews, at least till the captivity. Ex. 38:25, 26. We find from 2 Par. 25:6, 4 K. 15:19. &c. that it formed a very considerable sum. Yet Villalpand calculates that all the gold and silver left by David, would be requisite for the ornaments and vessels of the temple. If, however, we grant that it would have sufficed to build a massive temple of gold, how much must be deducted to pay the workmen? &c. C. Diss. on the riches left by David, t. ii.—*For all.* Heb. Chal. Sept. “And to these add.” T.—He encouraged the princes to contribute; (C. 29) and here he exhorts his son to shew his liberality, if any thing should be found deficient. H.  
**18** *Saying* is not expressed in Heb. “*Is* not the Lord,” &c.—*A* *nd hath.* Heb. “for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into my hand,” or power. H.—Almost all the neighbouring nations were subjected to David. C.—*The Lord*, who assisted his people, and filled the enemy with terror. M.  
**19** *Is* on the point of being *built.* David was convinced that the work would not be much longer retarded, so that he speaks of it as present. H.

## Chapter 23

**1** *Full*, satisfied, in the last year of his reign, and the 70th of his age. D.—*Cur non ut plenus vitæ conviva recedit?* Lucret. iii.—*Israel.* This example was much followed by succeeding kings. C.—Yet this is controverted. Houbigant. H.  
**2** *Princes*, heads of families, or officers of the army. C. 25:1. M.  
**3** *Numbered* at the same time, when David caused his son to be crowned, and made these fresh regulations, v. 27, and C. 26:31.—*Upwards*, according to the plan given by Moses. David afterwards ordered people of twenty years of age, to begin to serve in the tabernacle, as it was now fixed, and consequently the labours were diminished. This tended to augment the splendour of the religious worship, and to edify the people, who could not attend so constantly, in person.  
**4** *Overseers.* Heb. shoterim. Sept. “scribes.” Others suppose “lictors and executioners,” who attended the *judges.* Grotius.—These were functions from which the priests were exempted; ( C.) so that the Levites alone are meant. M.—*Judges.* They had to decide the causes of the people. 2 Par. 29. D.  
**5** *David.* Lit. “he.” Sept. “they.” Prot. “which I made (*said David*) to praise *therewith.*” H.  
**6** *Into* 24 *courses*, like the priests, that each class might serve twice a year for a whole week. C. 24:31. T.—God had already made choice of the posterity of Levi; and David, with the princes, Sadoc, &c. disposed of them by lots, (C. 24:6) to serve in the tabernacle, and in the future temple. W.  
**7** *Leedan*, or Lebni. Num. 3:18. M.  
**8** *Chief*, head of the rest; ( H.) or all these three were chiefs, (Jun.) no less than the sons of Semei, v. 9.  
**9** *Semei* *;* perhaps ( C.) sons of Joel. D.—The brother of Leedan had four sons, v. 10. M.  
**10** Ziza. Heb. has “Zina,” but reads “Ziza,” v. 11. C.  
**11** *Children.* All together were not more than the children of each of the preceding, so that they only formed one class. T.—It would have been too burdensome for them to have performed the same service with those who were far more numerous: ( H.) therefore the sons of Semei were joined with the family of Leedan: ( C.) or rather Jaus and Baria went together, as one family.—*Counted.* Heb. “in one class, according to *their* father’s house.” H.  
**13** *Minister.* Heb. “to sanctify the holy of holies.”—*His.* Heb. “in his name,” with solemnity. Num. 6:23. The Levites might bless the name of the Lord.  
**14** *Levi*, but not among the priests, ( C.) though their father was an extraordinary priest, appointed by God to anoint Aaron. Ps. 98. D.  
**15** *Eliezer.* His being uncircumcised, had almost proved fatal to his father. Ex. 4:24. M.—*First.* He might have other brothers, ( C.) though the title may be given to an only son, v. 17, Mat. 1:25. Subuel was perhaps ( H.) chief of a family, ( C.) and was appointed over the treasury. C. 26:24. M.  
**24** *Old.* See v. 3, and Num. 4:3.—*And upwards;* as long as they were able to serve. They were excused from carrying the tabernacle, &c. at fifty years of age. Num. 8:25. Abulens. M.—To those who were turned of thirty, the higher offices were entrusted; while the Levites began at twenty, to exercise themselves in things of less consequence, under the direction of their elder brethren. T.—The kings might declare, by the advice of the Sanhedrim, what laws were of a temporary nature. Grot. D.  
**25** *Ever.* They will not have to carry, the sacred vessels about, as formerly. H.—In order that they may not be idle, we must therefore provide them some other employment, v. 28, &c. T.  
**28** *Place.* Heb. “purifying all that is holy;” ( H.) keeping clean all that is used about the sacred ministry. C.  
**29** *And the priests*, &c. This is not found in Heb. or Sept. The Levites might prepare these things; though the priests alone were to offer them in sacrifice. T. C. 9:32, Lev. 24:8.—Others think that ( C.) the priests received flour from the people, and baked it. M.—But S. Jerom follows the tradition of the Jews, intimating that the priests sowed the corn, and did every thing about the loaves of proposition. In Mal. 1:6.—*Flour.* Lev. 2:1.—*Cakes.* Ex. 29:2.—*Roasting* the first-fruits. Lev. 2:14. M.—*Measure.* A standard was kept in the temple, (Ex. 30:13. C.) to prevent any fraud. The Ediles at Rome performed the same office. T.—There were not two measures in the country, as that would have caused confusion. D.  
**30** *And the Levites.* This also is omitted in Heb. “and to stand,” &c. as all the preceding offices pertained to the Levites, ( H.) and priests were bound equally with them to praise the Lord.  
**31** *Lord.* Music accompanied this service twice a day, as it did the sacrifices which were offered for the prince, or for the nation. Num. 10:10. C.—*Rest.* Heb. “the set festivals, by number, according to the order prescribed unto them continually,” &c. H.  
**32** *Brethren.* Let them follow the directions of the high priests, who are of the same tribe. M.

## Chapter 24

**2** *Before.* Heb. “in the presence of.” See Lev. 10:2.—*Priesthood*, under Aaron. Eleazar succeeded him, and the posterity of Ithamar obtained the dignity under Heli.  
**3** *Ahime* *lech* is styled also Achimelech and Abiathar, v. 6, 21 and C. 18:16. C.—*Courses*, twenty-four, which were to serve by lot, that no one might complain, as they were equally *princes*, v. 5. Hence S. Dionisius styles Zachary “prince of the priests.” But the pontiff was over all. T.  
**4** *Houses.* The descendants of Eleazar were far more numerous.  
**5** *Of God*, great. Elohim also signifies “judges,” and we might translate, “princes of the judges.” Grot. D.—These men occupied the first dignities of the priesthood, and of the judicature, or they were princes in all sacred affairs. C.—They were to offer sacrifice, and to enjoy spiritual jurisdiction, in the house of God. W.—As their claims were therefore equal, the decision was left to lots. M.—It would have been otherwise difficult for all to be satisfied. See Jos. 7:14. C.  
**6** Ithamar*.* All was done with the utmost order, and the priests took care to observe the regulation, till the end of the republic. Joseph. vii. 2 and con. Ap. i and ii, Lu. 1:5.—The family of Eleazar had many prerogatives over the rest, as it was longer in possession of the high priesthood, and more numerous; but that of Ithamar, gave pontiffs to the nation at the time of this regulation. The Heb. is very obscure, and is deemed incorrect. Cap. Grot. C.—Prot. “one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and *one* taken for Ithamar.”—The insertion of “one,” which is in the Sept. removes the difficulty. H.—The two families were enregistered alternately, ( M.) till the eight families of Ithamar were done. H.  
**10** *Abia*, the progenitor of S. John Baptist. Lu. 1:5. Yet whether his father was “chief of the priests” of his course, as S. Dion. asserts, or whether he sprung from Eleazar, or from Ithamar, is uncertain. T.  
**19** *Aaron*, and his successors. The former might have given some directions, which tradition had preserved. C.  
**20** *Subael*, grandson of Moses. C. 23:16.  
**21** *Rohobia* was in the same degree, by Eliezer. M.  
**23** *And his.* Prot. “the sons *of Hebron*, Jeriah, *the first.*” The words underlined, shew what omissions are in the text, ( H.) which is probably corrupted, as well as the Sept. Jeria and Amarias were sons of Hebron. C. 23:19 and 26:31. *Jahath* may, therefore, be the same with Hebron. C.  
**26** *The son.* Heb. “the son of Jehasia, *or* of Oziau …” But the name of this son is lost. It is wonderful that the posterity of Gersom are passed over. C.—Prot. “the sons of Jaaziah; Beno.—27. The sons of Merari, by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoam.” H.—Sept. vary, and the original text is supposed to be changed by some transcriber, (Capel. &c.) as we read only of Moholi and Musi, v. 26, and C. 23:21.  
**31** *Over-against*, in imitation of the priests, ( C.) being likewise divided into twenty-four classes. T.—*Both*, &c. Heb. “the principal fathers over-against their younger brethren.” All the rest is omitted. Lots decided the place and functions both of father and children. H.

## Chapter 25

**1** *Army;* the chief magistrates of the state and of the church. T. C. 24:6, 31.—The priests, &c. were all divided into twenty-four classes, each having twelve masters to preside, v. 7. C.—*Idithun*, or Ethan. C. 6:44 and 15:19. W. 3 K. 4:31.—The twenty-four sons of these three, who were chief musicians under David and Solomon, presided over the bands: eleven other inferior masters helped to instruct the rest, v. 9.—*Prophecy*, or play on instruments.—*Harps.* “Kinnor” means also the “guitar.” C.—Vulg. has, *lyras* *.* C. 15:16.—*Psalteries.* Heb. “nebalim.” M.—The Jews pretend that the singers were inspired commonly, when they sounded forth God’s praises in the temple, as Eliseus was, 4 K. 3:15. Lyran. E.—But they may be said to prophesy, because they sung the composition of the prophets. W.—*According.* Heb. “and the number of the workmen, (or experienced musicians) according to their service, was.” H.—The chiefs of the twenty-four bands were carefully selected.  
**2** *King*, who sat in a separate tribune. Asaph presided in the royal city, at court, and in the tabernacle, while some of the singers were fixed at Gabaon. C. 16:7, 37 and 41. C.—Heb. may signify, “at the king’s command. Pagnin.—He sometimes condescended to direct the singers, v. 6. H.  
**3** *Of Idithun;* or, altering the punctuation, ( D.) “Now the sons of Idithun, *the first-born*, Godolias ( H.) Sori, or Isari, v. 11. Thus, the number *six*, will be complete: otherwise we much acknowledge that Idithun, the father, is counted with his children; or that a name is lost, perhaps that of Semeias, (v. 17. C.) as Sept. Alex. has Semei before Hasabias. H.—*Harp*, (kinnor.) This was the distinctive instrument of this band, as the *horn* was of Heman’s. C.  
**5** *Seer;* a title usually given to the real prophets, who foresee future things. M.—Gad has this title. 2 Par. 24:11. But Heman’s office was to proclaim the words of God, with the sound of the horn. This musician had formerly been fixed at Gabaon, C. 16:41. C.—*To lift up the horn*, or to sing those psalms, which regarded the kingdom of David, and of Christ, as others were composed for the instruction of the people. T.—*Daughters.* These are specified, only because they joined with their brethren, in singing in the temple. Abul. q. 14. M.—At least, we find that there were bands of young women, in the solemn procession. H. C. 15:20, Ps. 67:26. C.  
**6** *Near.* Heb. “under the hand of the king,” who presided over a band of musicians, as well as Asaph; ( C.) or he directed all, particularly giving his instructions to Asaph, &c.—*To wit* in not in Heb. “by the order of the king to Asaph.” H.  
**7** *Eight*, comprising the twenty-four princes, and the eleven secondary masters of each of the bands, or twelve times twenty-four, v. 1.  
**8** *Unlearned.* Heb. and Sept. “the scholars.” H.—After the singers had been distributed into twenty-four classes, pretty equal in number, lots decided which of then should serve first, ( M.) as had been done with the priests. C. 24:31. See C. 26:13.  
**9** *Asaph.* Add, “to him, and ( H.) to his sons, and his brethren, twelve,” who taught the rest. Unless these twelve be admitted, ( T.) as in the sequel, ( H.) the number 288 will not be found, v. 7. T.—Sept. is very confused: “And the first (entire) lot of his sons and brethren came out to Asaph, of Joseph, Godolias: the second Enia, his brethren, and his sons, twelve.” Heb. “the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph; the second to,” &c. Prot. In all the subsequent verses they read, “*he*, his sons, and his brethren, *were* twelve.” Why Asaph should be mentioned any more than Idithun or Heman, does not appear. Their children are placed indiscriminately by lot. H.  
**14** *Isreela;* probably Oziel, v. 4. C.

## Chapter 26

**1** *Porters*, who guarded the temple, being stationed at the four gates. They were selected from the families of Core and Merari, (v. 19.) and were under C. five captains, two being placed at the gate leading from the palace, v. 16. H.—How many were appointed to follow the directions of these officers, we do not find. But 4,000 porters are mentioned, C. 23:5. Some guarded the treasury, &c. After the captivity, the same plan was adopted, C. 9. C.—*Son*, or descendant of Core, by Asaph, ( H.) or Abiasaph, (C. 6:37) different from the musician. C.  
**5** *Him.* Obededom, by giving him a more numerous posterity, than any here mentioned, v. 8. See 2 K. 6:11. C. T.  
**6** *Semei*, who is called Semeias, v. 4 and 7. The last syllable is not lost in Heb. or Sept. H.—*Valour.* Their post was of a military nature, and required strength. Josephus says, some of the gates could hardly be shut by twenty men.  
**10** *He had not a first-born.* That is, his first-born was either dead or not fit to be chief, and therefore he made Semri the chief, ( W. Ch.) who was the second son ( T.) of Hosa. Heb. “for, *or* though he was not the first-born, yet his father made him chief.” Sept. add, “of the second division,” but without reason, as they interpret, “keeping the command,” instead of *Semri, the chief*, which leaves us without a proper name. H.  
**12** *Lord.* The companies succeeded each other every sabbath, but the chiefs were not changed. C.—The office of these men was most noble. From them were selected treasurers, overseers, prefects, &c. v. 16–32. T.—The lot decided only between the heads of families. D.  
**14** *Selemias* *:* the first syllable is frequently neglected in Heb. C. 4:24. T.—*Zacharias* was the first-born of *Meselemia*, v. 2. H.—*A very.* Heb. “a wise counsellor.” C.  
**15** **Ver** **.** **15** **.** *And.* Prot. “To Obededom southward, and to his sons, the house of Asuppim.” H.—This term may denote the “revenue;” where the offerings, destined for the support of the priests, were collected. Ex. 34:22. We find the same word used for the offerings received at the door of the temple. 2 Esd. 12:15. It may also mean the house “of the assemblies,” ( C.) where the 72 judges of the Sanhedrim met. Villalp. T.  
**16** *Which.* Heb. Shalecheth, ( C.) or ssolcoth, ( H.) “which leads *or* casts out” the filth from the temple. Villalp. Isai. 6:13. M.—But there were conduits for that purpose; and the meaning of the Vulg. is more accurate. C.—The palace lay below the tabernacle and the temple, ( T.) on the west. Joseph. 15:14. C.—*Ward.* The centinels where opposite to each other, ( M.) or at equal distances. All were replaced at the same time. C.—Two captains were stationed on this road, for greater respect to the king, ( H.) and because the concourse and dangers were increased, v. 18. T.  
**17** *Six.* This gate was the most frequented, ( C.) and the king entered by it.—*Council.* Heb. asupim, as v. 15, “for the offerings two *and* two,” ( H.) distinct from the porters.  
**18** *Cell.* Heb. is not clearer: “at the chamber” ( C. ‘at the house of the instruments’ for sacrifice. ( M.) at Parbar. Prot.) of the west, at the ascent, two at each chamber.” C.—Prot. “at the causey, and two at Parbar.” This term is not in Heb. It resembles Parvar, or Pharurim, (4 K. 23:11) which is said to signify “suburbs,” in Chal. But it cannot have this meaning here: and these terms are probably borrowed from the Greek, φρουρα, a military “post;” so that we might translate “There were at the western post, four guards for the ascent, two at each post:” one perhaps was near the temple, ( C.) the other at the palace gates. 4 K. 11:6. Sept. is more diffuse, but throws no light upon this passage. H.  
**20** *Now.* Heb. and Sept. add, “the Levites:” the latter translate *Achias*, “their brethren.” H.—*Vessels.* Or vessels of the holy places, or of things holy. *Vasa sanctorum* *.* Ch.—Sept. “of the consecrated treasures.” C. 28:12. H.  
**21** *Ledan* is called Leedan, (C. 23:8) son of Gerson. His first-born was Jahiel. This person is here styled Jehieli, and was chief of the Gersonites; at least the eldest branch.  
**22** *Brethren.* Heb. and Sept. “brother.” In effect, we find that Joel was the son of Leedan. C. 23.—*Zathan*, whose name ends in *m* both in Heb. and Sept. may perhaps be his grandson. We often find *sons* in Heb. when only one is specified. Jehieli might adopt his two brothers; so that none of his own children are mentioned. H.—We may also translate: “(21) These are the sons of Ledan, the Gersonite. Out of Ledan, the Gersonite, came chiefs of families: Jehiel, (22) the sons of Jehiel, Zathan and Joel, his (Jehiel’s) brethren, *were* over,” &c. It appears that Jehiel was treasurer. C. 29:8.  
**23** *Ozielites.* These are all the sons of Caath. C. 6:18.  
**24** *Moses.* Many are passed over; ( C.) or Subael acted by his children. M.  
**26** *Selemith* was to guard the treasure, taken in war. C.—*Dedicated.* Lit. “sanctified,” by designating for holy uses. W.  
**27** *Wars.* Heb. “out of the spoils won in battles, which they had set apart as sacred, to support the house,” &c. Sept. “that the building of the house of the Lord might not be retarded.” H.—Yet these spoils remained untouched by Solomon, who imitated this piety, as others did. 3 K. 14:26. The Romans adored Jupiter *Prædator*, as he was styled, because part of the plunder was allotted to him. Serv. in Æn. iii.  
**28** *Samuel*, while he was at the head of affairs. M.—*Joab.* Though these three were not very religious, they concurred in promoting the splendour of the public worship, as that would at least procure them applause. H.  
**29** *Them.* Heb. “for officers (shoterim, “scribes,” ( H.) whose power was very great. C.) and judges.” The former are often placed first, as more honourable, so that they were not mere heralds or executioners. The administration of justice was chiefly in the hands of the Levitical tribe. C. 23:4. The sons of Hebron resided on the east, while those of Isaar and Oziel probably acted as judges on the western side of the Jordan, v. 30. C.—They were not confined to the temple, but taught the people the law of Moses in the cities *abroad.* M.  
**30** *Beyond.* Heb. *meheber* means, “at the passage, *or* on either side.” Prot. “on this side Jordan, westward.” This would seem to designate the countries nearer Jerusalem. H.—But *westward* may also be understood with reference to Ruben, &c. so as to mean the parts along the river.—*King.* To decide both ecclesiastical and civil causes. C.—They also inspected the preparations for the temple, and gathered the king’s tribute. Grotius.  
**31** *Jazer*, a city of Gad, in *Galaad.* Adric. M.

## Chapter 27

**1** *Now.* This list is entirely of a political nature. It seems to have been made before David had obtained the throne of Israel, (v. 7.) though perhaps the monthly division did not comprise 24,000, before that time. This regulation was very excellent, and enabled the king to have an army of 300,000 men, at a short notice. It was not attended with any material inconvenience to the people, as none were on service above a month.—*Hands.* Commanders in chief.—*Captains.* Twenty-four in number, with 240 centurions under them.—*Officers.* Heb. shoterim. Sept. “scribes,” whose employment is not well ascertained. They perhaps acted as commissaries, or kept an account of the king’s troops, and reviewed them. C.—Sept. “and scribes serving the people, and the king’s orders respecting the divisions, both coming in and going out, monthly, throughout the year. One division comprised 24,000 men.  
**2** *Jesboam.* Heb. “Jashobham,” as C. 11:11. He was the first after Joab, ( H.) and a descendant of Pharez, like David, and waiting upon the king in the month of Nisan, which almost agrees with our March ( M.) and April. H.—Zabdiel, the Hachmonite, may therefore denote his country; (Kennicott) or Zabdiel might be his ancestor, though the same man has frequently different names. We find several companions of this general in the sequel.  
**4** *Dudia*, of Dodi, the father of Eleazar. C. 11:12. C.—*After him*, his substitute. T.—Heb. “and Macelloth, chief also of his course, consisting likewise of 24,000.” H.  
**5** *Priest.* This we read no where else, so that some understand, “a chief officer at court,” 2 K. 8:18. C.—But he might be ( H.) of the tribe of Levi. M.—His exploits are mentioned. C. 11:21.  
**6** *Company*, in his absence, ( H.) as lieutenant. Salien.  
**7** *After him.* He acted under his father, and succeeded ( M.) to Asahel’s post, after Abner had slain him. 2 K. 2:23 and 23:24. C.  
**8** *Samaoth.* Perhaps Samma, or Sammoth of Arodi, or Arari; places with which we are not acquainted, unless they denote some of his progenitors. Jazer is well known. C.—C. 26:31.  
**9** *Hari.* Mentioned as one of David’s brave men. C. 11:28.  
**10** *Phallonite*, or of Phalti. 2 K. 23:26.  
**11** *Zarahi*, or of Zara, the son of Thamar. C. 11:29. Sobochai slew the giant Saph, 2 K. 21:17.  
**12** Jemini, or Benjamin. C.—The first syllable is neglected. M.  
**13** *Marai*, or Marahai, sprung from Zara. C.  
**14** *Ephraim.* Pharathon was in this tribe. M.  
**15** *Holdai*, called *Heled, the son of Baana.* C. 11:30 and 2 K. 23:29.—*Gothoniel.* So the Sept. write Othoniel, ( H.) so famous in the book of Judges, 1:13 and 3:9.  
**16** *Chiefs*, by their birth-right. The former were chosen for merit. T.—The tribes of Aser and of Gad are omitted, either because the list was not in the hands of the author, or it was overlooked by transcribers. C.—*Rubenites*, with whom Em. Sa joins the Gadites. M.  
**18** *Eliu.* Probably the same with Eliab, the eldest son of Isai, (1 K. 16:7. C.) or the youngest but David, (C. 2:15) whose name is preserved by the Syriac, &c.  
**23** *Heaven.* It would have seemed, therefore, as if David distrusted the divine promise, ( H.) and attempted what was impossible (Grot.) or useless. C.—He had before offended, and hence would now only number those who were wanted. W.  
**24** *Number*, those above 20; but he acted with reluctance, ( T.) and the *wrath* of heaven prevented the entire completion of the king’s order. C. 21:6 and 2 K. 24:9.—*David.* It would hence appear that the list was perfected, but not delivered to the king. The commissioners retained some of the lists; and, perhaps from these, Esdras has inserted what relates to Benjamin, (C. 7:6) as the account was not given in C. 21:6. C.—This list may, however, have been made at another time; as we are informed that Benjamin and Levi were not numbered. H.—The Book of Kings, where we find it, is therefore a different work. D.  
**25** *Treasures* of gold, &c. as those of provisions had other officers. C.—*Were in.* Heb. and Sept. add, “the fields, in the cities,” &c. H.—This must be understood of corn; wine is mentioned afterwards. Nothing could give us a higher opinion of David’s wisdom than these details.  
**26** *Ground*, for the king. This was done at the expense of the nation, and by the people, no less than the vintage. 2 K. 8:12. The companions of Daniel were thus appointed to superintend the workmen of Nabuchodonosor. Dan. 2:49. Xenophon (Cyrop. viii.) styles such, εργων επιστατας, “men set over the works.” H.  
**27** *Cellars.* Heb. “over the increase of the vineyards, for the wine cellars.” Prot. Wine was formerly kept in cisterns, in the vineyards, till it was taken into large earthen vessels, and placed in cellars.  
**29** *Saron*, a fertile region at the food of the mountains of Galaad; also a vale near the Mediterranean, ( C.) in Ephraim, extending as far as Joppe. Adric. M.  
**30** *Ismahelite.* People of that nation deal much in camels. C.—Ubil had embraced the Jewish religion, or perhaps he was originally an Israelite, but had acquired the title of Ismahelite by some exploit, or by residing long in the country. M.  
**32** *Man.* Heb. “a writer.” He was a good politician and lawyer. Grot.—*Sons*, as tutors. D. C.—*Jahiel* was perhaps the brother of Jesbaam. C. 11:11. M.  
**33** *Friend.* Chusai rendered the most signal service to the king, 2 K. 16:23 and 17:1. C.  
**34** *After*, inferior, (Salien) as Achitophel’s advice was esteemed like an oracle, ( C.) or Joiada, a chief priest, and Abiathar, the pontiff, succeeded to his place, after he had hung himself. T. D.

## Chapter 28

**1** *Israel.* These are more particularly described as *princes of the tribes*, ( H.) twelve *captains*, &c. C. 27:1.—*And his.* Heb. “and of his sons.” C.—We may also understand this of the preceptors of the royal family. C. 27:32.—*Officers.* Lit. “eunuchs.” H.—*Bravest;* particularly those specified C. 11.  
**2** *Rising up* from his bed, on which he lay, on account of his great age and weakness, while he addressed himself to his son; (3 K. 1:47. C.) or he rose from his throne, to honor this grand assembly. Heb. “stood upon his feet.” H.—*Thought.* Heb. “I, with my heart, *thought* to,” &c. C.—*And*, or which is *the footstool.* H.—The ark is often so called, because God was considered as sitting upon the wings of the cherubim, over it. Ps. 98:1. &c.—*Building.* No doubt what David left would have been sufficient. Yet Solomon thought that he could make something still more magnificent.  
**3** *Blood.* See C. 22:8. C.  
**4** *Ever;* for a long time, and to leave the throne to my posterity for many ages, and to the Messias for ever. This expression is not always to be taken in its rigour. C.—*Princes.* Heb. “prince, or the ruler.” H.—This tribe had long possessed the greatest power, ( C.) and the promise of the sceptre. Gen. 49. W.—The phrase often denotes a long time, but it is best understood of Christ. D.  
**5** *My son*, by the mouth of Nathan. 2 K. 7:13. M.—Solomon was a figure of Christ, and his dignity was predicted. C. 17:11, 3 K. 1:13. C.  
**7** *If.* The promises of the Old Testament were frequently conditional, and we always find the condition marked in some place; but those made to the Church of Christ, have no such limitation. H.—*Day.* Solomon was once faithful, and afterwards fell; it is uncertain whether ever to rise again. Hence it appears that the true children of God may become wicked. W.  
**8** *Seek.* Wilful ( H.) or supine ignorance will excuse no man. M.  
**9** *Know*, with affection ( H.) and faith; and him alone must thou serve. D.—*Forsake him*, and die impenitent. H.  
**11** *Description*, impressed by God on David’s imagination; (Cajet.) or rather planned out by the hand of God, (v. 19. Salien) as the law was written. H.—The Jews pretend that this plan was delivered to Moses, and handed down by Josue, &c. to David. E.—But why might not David receive it immediately from heaven? C.—*Treasures.* Lit. “cellars.” H.—The original term, *Ganzac*, is not Heb. We find Ganas (Est. 3:9) to signify a treasure, being derived from the Persian, Gaza. David gave, therefore, a description of the rooms to keep the treasures of the temple, or of the cellars for wine and oil. C.—Sept. “a pattern of the temple and of the houses thereof, and of the Zakcho, and of the upper rooms, and of the inner storehouses,” &c. H.—*Inner*, or most retired closets, (3 K. 20:30. C.) where the Levites slept. M.—*Seat*, where the ark was kept, and God was rendered propitious. H.  
**13** *Divisions*, into twenty-four classes, ( M.) which was done by God’s order. H.—*For all*, that everything might be done with regularity. M.  
**14** *Weight*, or sufficient for each, v. 15. H.—Some think he only left a memorial of what quantity of gold and silver would be requisite. It does not appear that Solomon used silver for the vessels, as he chose to execute his father’s injunctions with still greater magnificence.  
**15** *Silver.* David probably intended that five candlesticks would be made of this metal: but Solomon made all the ten of gold. 3 K. 7:49. There was one in the tabernacle. Ex. 25:31. C.—But the temple was more spacious, and a greater number was not prohibited. M.—*According* *.* Heb. “for the use of every candlestick.”  
**16** *Silver.* Yet all the ten were composed of the purest gold, (2 Par. 4:12) as silver was too common, ib. 9:20. Moses had only two tables. C.—*Diversity.* Heb. “for each table.” Vat.  
**17** *Lions.* S. Jerom seems to have read cephir, instead of the present *cephor*, which is rendered “a cup, or bowl.” 1 Esd. 1:10. C.—Sept. Alex. “and of the flesh-hooks, libation vessels and bowls; and the weight of the golden and silver *vessels* (*kepphoure;* a word which they do not translate) of each weight.” H.—The change of *i* for *u* was very easy; and perhaps the basins were ornamented with representations of lions. D. M.—We do not find *cephor* used before, to denote any of the vessels of the tabernacle: but Esdras uses it, (C. 8:27) whence it is inferred that it is of Chal. extraction.  
**18** *Purest.* Heb. “refined.”—*Lord.* He was represented as riding in a chariot, drawn by Cherubim, ( C.) or sitting on their wings. H.—Two, particularly, filled up the space between the walls in the most holy place, and covered the ark, and also the Cherubim made by Moses, 3 K. 7:23.  
**19** *These things, said he*, is not in Heb. Sept. “All in the handwriting of the Lord, did David give to Solomon, according to the knowledge given to him from above, respecting the workmanship of the pattern.” H.—David saw the pattern in a kind of ecstasy; (Salien. E.) or some prophet delivered it unto him, ( C.) marked out by the hand of an angel, ( T.) like the tabernacle given to Moses. D.  
**20** *Lord.* Sept. add, “and I beheld, *or* behold, the pattern of the temple, and of the house and the Zakcho thereof, and the upper rooms and inner storehouses, and the house of propitiation, and the pattern of the house of the Lord: (21) and behold,” v. 11. H.  
**21** *Thee.* Heb. and Sept. “for all workmanship, every willing skilful man for any service, also all the princes, and the people entirely at thy commands.” H.—The willing artificers are distinguished from those who were forced to work, though the former also received pay. C.

## Chapter 29

**1** *Tender*, not so much in years, for he was 22, but in comparison with David, and with reference to so great a work. M.  
**2** *Onyx*, or “emeralds.” C.—Sept. “*soom*,” from the Heb. shoham.—*Alabaster.* Heb. puc. H.—The dark paint used for the eyes, has the same name. 4 K. 9:30, Jer. 4:30. Yet the stibium or stimmi, or alabaster, mentioned by Pliny, (xxxiii. 6.) was of a sliver colour, but not transparent. The stone here specified was probably alabaster, as it was used for the pavement. There is a very fine species at Damascus, and in Arabia, which was much sought after to decorate buildings. C.—Chal. has “emeralds.” Sept. “stones of perfection, rich and various, and every precious stone, and much Parion.” H.—But Isai. 54:11, they translate the same term, “carbuncle.” C.—The stone might resemble the agate, which is beautifully shaded with clouds and other fanciful figures. T.—*Paros:* this is taken from the Sept. Heb. has simply, “and stones of ssiss.” H.—Whether it denote the isle of Chio, or that of Chitis, in the Red Sea, the former famous for marble, and the latter for topaz; or it may refer to Sais, a city of Egypt, which had most beautiful porphyry. Pliny xxxvi. 7. and xxxvii. 8.—But Paros, one of the Cyclades, was most renowned for its white marble. ib. xxxvi. 5.—Josephus (Bel. vi. 6.) informs us, that the temple was built of large white marble stones; so that it appeared, at a distance, to be covered with snow. C.  
**3** *Own.* What he had already vowed, he esteemed no longer his. W.—*Temple.* Heb. “houses,” including the various apartments belonging to the temple. The sum which David had formerly set apart out of the spoils of war, &c. amounted to 835,000,000*l.* What he now adds, is 16,125,000*l.* sterling, according to Brerewood, who deems the sums exorbitant; and others have suspected that there is a mistake in the former numbers. We have seen with what foundation. C. 22:14. David was so convinced, that the sum which he had been able to collect was too small, that he exhorted the princes to contribute, with all their power, and set them this noble example, which they endeavoured to imitate. H.—He had collected some of the gold of *Ophir*, which was esteemed the best. C. See 3 K. 9:28. M.—We have before remarked, that Solomon went beyond the expectations of his father, and used no *silver.*  
**5** *Fill his hand*, is an expression applied to priests, by which David imitates, that any one may now offer a species of sacrifice to the Lord. Judg. 7:5, Ex. 32:29. C. M.—He wishes them to act with generosity. H.  
**6** *Possessions*, mentioned C. 27:25.  
**7** *Solids.* Sept. “pieces of gold;” χρυσους. Heb. adarcnim, which Prot. render “drachms,” ( H.) after the Syr. &c. Others think that the Darics, used in Persia, are meant, though they did not exist in David’s time. Esdras might reduce the money to correspond with the coin with which his countrymen were then acquainted. 2 Esd. 7:70. Pelletier.—The Daric was equivalent to the golden sicle, which was only half the weight of one of silver, though this is not certain. C.—A solid was only the sixth part of an ounce, whereas the sicle weighed half an ounce, or four drachms.—*Talents* were always of the same weight, 125 Roman pounds. M.  
**8** *Gersonite;* who, with his brethren, was treasurer. C. 26:22.  
**9** *Willingly.* Their disposition was perfect: for God loves a cheerful giver. 2 Cor. 9:7. C.  
**10** *From.* Sept. “from age to age;” (Pagnin, &c.) that is, throughout eternity: ( M.) “for ever and ever.” Prot. Eternity has no parts. H.  
**11** *Magnificence.* Thee we ought to magnify. David uses many words to express the sentiments of his grateful soul. M.  
**12** *Thine.* Heb. and Sept. “of thee.” H.—*Greatness.* Heb. “to magnify and strengthen all.” M.—Our riches are thy gifts; and to thee we return a part, with gladness.  
**14** *Promise.* Heb. “to offer so willingly in this manner?” H.—He is astonished at the rich display of gifts: but acknowledged that all was originally sent by God. In the same sentiments, we say in the mass, “We offer unto thee of thy own presents and gifts;” or, as the Greek expresses it, τα σα απο των σων. C.  
**15** *Strangers.* We have nothing but what we have received from thee; and for how short a time! C.—*No stay.* Heb. “none abiding, ( H. *or*) no hope” of being able to escape death, ( C.) when we must leave all. How happy, therefore, are those who sent their treasures before them! H.—All are pilgrims, with respect to heaven. Heb. 13. W.  
**17** *Simplicity.* Heb. “uprightness.” Sept. “justice;” ( H.) a pure intention, which our Saviour styled *a single eye.* Mat. 6:22. T.  
**18** *This.* Heb. “keep this for ever, in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and direct their heart unto thee. Preserve these good dispositions, which though has given them.” C.  
**20** *Then* is not in Heb. or Sept. H.—The same term is used, to express the outward adoration which they shewed to God, and the civil respect which was due to the king: *pari gestu*, says Grotius, *animo diverso* *.* C.—How then will Protestants prove that we are guilty of idolatry, when we bow down before the cross, &c. unless they pretend to know the secrets of hearts? Prot. they “bowed down their heads, (Sept. knees) and worshipped the Lord and the king.” H.—The exterior set was the same, but the intention determined the application. See Ex. 20. W.  
**21** *And* *with.* Heb. and Sept. “and their sacrifices *of wine* and victims, (or peace-offerings, to be eaten by the people. C.) in abundance for all Israel.” H.  
**22** *The Lord*, at Jerusalem, ( M.) where the ark was then kept. H.—*Second time:* the first had been done with too much precipitation, in consequence of the attempt of Adonias; (3 K. 1:39. T.) or this took place after the death of David, that his successor might be invested with full power, (Grot.) and be acknowledged by all. H.—*Priest.* This at least only took place after the death of David, when Abiathar fell into disgrace. 3 K. 2:35. Both prince and priest must act by God’s authority; and those who resist them, resist God himself. Rom. 13:1. C.—They are ministers of the *Lord.* H.  
**24** *Gave.* Heb. “placed their hands upon Solomon.” Sept. “were subject to him.” C.—The latter words in the Vulg. explain the meaning of the ceremony. M.—It seems to have been similar to that used by Abraham required an oath of his servant. Gen. 24:2. Vassals placed their hands within those of their Lord, under whom they hold lands; ( C.) and the descendants of the Germans testify their submission, by putting their hands between a person’s knees. Grotius.—The nobles took the oath of fidelity to Solomon, by some such method. C.  
**29** Gad*, the seer* “of David,” as he is sometimes styled. These three were well acquainted with David, ( C.) and wrote the two first books of Kings; ( H.) or at least those books are compiled from their memorials, ( C.) if their works be lost, ( M.) which is uncertain. W.  
**30** *Under him* in various tribulations, towards the end of his reign. Vatable, &c.—Those prophets recorded not only what regarded David, ( H.) but also what happened of consequence, in other nations, with which he had any connections.—*Of the.* Syr. and Arab. “of his land, *or* among the kings of his race.” C.—David reduced under his dominion not only the nations which dwelt in Chanaan, but all those which had been promised *to Israel.* H.
