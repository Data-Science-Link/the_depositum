# Daniel Commentary

DANIEL, whose name signifies “the judgment of God,” was of the royal blood of the kings of Juda, and one of those that were first of all carried away into captivity. He was so renowned for his wisdom and knowledge, that it became a proverb among the Babylonians, “as wise as Daniel;” (Ezech. 28:3) and his holiness was so great from his very childhood, that at the time when he was as yet but a young man, he is joined by the Spirit of God with Noe and Job, as three persons most eminent for virtue and sanctity. Ezech. 14. He is not commonly numbered by the Hebrews among *the prophets*, because he lived at court, and in high station in the world: but if we consider his many clear predictions of things to come, we shall find that no one better deserves the name and title of *a prophet;* which also has been given him by the Son of God himself. Mat. 24. Mark 13. Luke 21.) Ch.—The ancient Jews ranked him among the greatest prophets. Jos. Ant. x. 12. and 1 Mac. 2:59. Those who came after Christ began to make frivolous exceptions, because he so clearly pointed out the coming of our Saviour, (Theod.) that Porphyrius has no other method of evading this authority except by saying, that the book was written under Epiphanes after the event of many of the predictions. S. Jer.—But this assertion is contrary to all antiquity. Some parts have indeed been questioned, which are found only in Greek. They must, however, have sometime existed in Heb. or Chal. else how should we have the version of Theodotion, which the Church has substituted instead of the Sept. as that copy was become very incorrect, and is now lost? C.—Some hopes of its recovery are nevertheless entertained; and its publication, at Rome, has been announced. Kennicott.—In a title, it seems to make the Daniel visited by Habacuc, a priest; but it is abandoned. C.—This version of course proves that the original was formerly known; and the loss of it, at present, is no more decisive against the authenticity of these pieces, that that of S. Matthew’s *Heb.* original, and of the Chaldee of Judith, &c. will evince that their works are spurious. H.—Extracts of ( C.) Aquila and Sym. seen by S. Jerom, ( W.) are also given in the Hexapla. Origen has answered the objections of Africanus, respecting the history of Susanna; and his arguments are equally cogent, when applied to the other contested works. The Jews and Christians were formerly both divided in their sentiments about these pieces. C. See S. Jer. in Jer. xxix. 12 and xxxii. 44.—But now as the Church (*the pillar of truth*) has spoken, all farther controversy ought to cease; ( H.) and we should follow the precept, *Remove not the landmarks which thy fathers have placed.* Deut. 19:14. See N. Alex. t. ii. S. Jerom, who sometimes calls these pieces “fables,” explains himself, by observing, that he had delivered “not his own sentiments,” but those of the Jews: *quid illi contra nos dicere soleant* *.* C.—If he really denied their authority, his opinion ought not to outweigh that of so many other ( H.) Fathers and Councils who receive them. They admit *all the parts*, as the Council of Trent expressly requires us to do. See S. Cyp. &c. also the observations prefixed to Tobias, ( W.) and p. 597. H.—Paine remarks that Daniel and Ezechiel only pretended to have visions, and carried on an enigmatical correspondence relative to the recovery of their country. But this deserves no refutation. By allowing that their works are genuine, he cuts up the very root of his performance. Watson.—Daniel, according to Sir Is. Newton, resembles the Apoc. (as both bring us to the end of the Roman empire) and is “the most distinct in order of time, and easiest to be understood; and therefore, in those things that relate to the last times, he must be made a key to the rest.” Bp. Newton.—Yet there are many difficulties which require a knowledge of history; (S. Jer. W.) and we must reflect on the words of Christ, *He that readeth, let him understand.* Mat. 24:15. Daniel ( H.) is supposed to have died at court, ( C.) aged 110, having written many things of Christ. W.—His name is not prefixed to his book, yet as Prideaux observes, he sufficiently shews himself in the sequel to be the author. H.

## Chapter 1

**1** *Third*, at the conclusion, so that it is called the *fourth.* Jer. 25:1. A. Lap. M.—Nabuchodonosor began his expedition into Syria a year before he was king; (Salien, A. 3428. Jos. &c.) or he had the title before his father Nabopolassar’s death. Usher, A. 3397.—The following year he took Joakim, with a design to convey him to Babylon; but left him on hard terms, and seized many of the sacred vessels, Daniel, &c. C.—Joakim reigned other eight years. 2 Par. 36:5. W.  
**2** *His god; Bel*, or *Belas*, the principal idol of the Chaldeans. Ch.—The king pretended to derive his pedigree from Belus, (Abyd. Eus. præp. 1.) and greatly enriched his temple, ( C.) which Xerxes demolished. Arrian.—*God.* Some part might be kept in the *palace.* C. 5:10 and 2 Par. 36:7.  
**3** *Eunuchs*, or chief officers. The Jews assert that Daniel was made an eunuch. Is. 39:7. But he might be so styled on account of his dignity. C.—*Princes.* Lit. “tyrants.” H.—This name was afterwards only rendered odious by the misconduct of several kings. C.—Heb. parthemim, ( H.) seems to be of Greek derivation, alluding to προτιμοι, or προτοι, “the first or most honoured.” Drus.—We find here other Greek words. C.  
**4** *Blemish.* Deformed people were excluded the throne, or the king’s presence. Procop. 1.—*Science;* well educated, or apt to learn. They were first to be taught the Chaldee letters, which then differed from the Hebrew. C.  
**5** *Meat:* more exquisite. De Dieu.—All was first served on the king’s table. Athen. vi. 14.  
**6** *Juda.* It is thought all four were of royal blood. C.—Others were also kept at court. M.  
**7** *Baltassar*, or as Chaldees ( C. or Masorets. H.) pronounce, *Beltesasar*, “the treasurer of Baal.” The names were changed to testify their subjection, ( C.) and that they might embrace the manners of the Chaldees. M.—The new names alluded to the sun. C.  
**8** *Daniel*, as head and nearer the throne, gave good example to the rest. W.—*Defiled*, either by eating meat forbidden by the law, or which had before been offered to idols. Ch.—It was customary among the pagans to make an offering of some parts to their gods, or throw it into the fire. Theod. C.—These reasons determined the pious youths, ( H.) who desired also to keep free from gluttony and other vices. Theod. W.  
**11** Malassar, another inferior officer. It means also one appointed over the mouth or provisions, ( C.) and might be Asphenez. v. 3, 9. H.  
**12** *Pulse.* That is, pease, beans, and such like. Ch.—S. Basil hence shews the advantages of fasting; and Catholics, who imitate Daniel, may expect the like reward in heaven: and the hope that such a pattern would not displease their dissenting brethren, but rather screen them from their profane sarcasms. H.  
**17** *Dreams.* He was learned in all the sciences of the country, like Moses. Acts 7:22. C.—They studies these things, in order to refute what was erroneous: *discunt … ut judicent* *.* S. Jer.—The Chaldeans paid great attention to dreams. Daniel acquired the knowledge of such as were sent from heaven by the gift of God, as Joseph had done. To pay any regard to common dreams would be childish ( C.) and sinful, if the person depend on them for the knowledge of futurity. H.  
**20** *Diviners*, or fortune-tellers.—*Wise men.* Sept. “philosophers.” C.—Heb. Ashaphim, may come from the Gr. sophoi. Grot.—They had been educated three years. v. 5. H.  
**21** *Cyru* *s;* and also to the third, (C. 10) and of course during the whole of the captivity. W.—He was maintained in power by the conqueror of Babylon. C. 6:18 and 14:1. He first displayed his sagacity in the cause of Susanna, (C. 13. C.) whose history was placed at the head of the book, in Theodotion, (S. Jer. in Isai. iii. 1) as in its natural order. C.

## Chapter 2

**1** *Year*, from the death of his father, Nabopolassar; for he had reigned before as partner with his father, in the empire. Ch.—In that quality he conquered Syria, ( A. 3397) took Daniel, &c. in 3399. He succeeded his father. Usher. C.—After he had enlarged his empire by the conquest of Egypt, &c. he had this dream. A. R. 25. W.—*Mind.* Sept. “his sleep departed from him.” H.—He was restless, recollecting enough to fill him with trouble. When the dream was repeated over, he knew that it was the same. C.  
**2** *The Chaldeans.* That is, the astrologers, that pretended to divine by stars. Ch.—They dwelt on the banks of the Euphrates, and were highly esteemed. Diod. Sic. i.—They were the most ancient philosophers. Civ. Div. i.  
**3** *I know.* Heb. also, “to know or understand what,” &c.  
**4** *Syriac.* It was originally the same as the Chaldee. Daniel understood this language, as well as Heb. and writes in it what concerned the Chaldees, to C. 8. This shews his accuracy, as he makes his speakers use their own tongue. Spinosa ignorantly asserts, that all the seven first chapters are in Chal. and taken from the records of that nation by Judas Macc. How then did Matthathias become acquainted with the contents?  
**5** *Put.* Chal. “torn to pieces, and your house become infamous places;” ( C.) Prot. “a dunghill” H.—Such cruel punishments were not uncommon. 1 Esd. 6:11. C.—Bessus was torn in pieces by the relations of Darius; (Diod. xvii.) and the Persians generally cut off some member of criminals. Brisson ii.  
**8** *Gain.* Lit. “redeem” H.—S. Paul uses a similar expression, exhorting us to save our souls even at the expense of our temporal interest. C.—The diviners wished to give the king’s fury time to abate, ( H.) and to save their lives; ( C.) or delay punishment, at least, as much as possible. H.  
**9** *Thereof.* It is indeed more easy to discover what dream a person has had, than to explain it; since the devil might disclose the former, but he can only guess at what will happen, and herein his agents are often deceived. See Gen. 40. W.—It is not even certain that the devil can know the dreams which we have not divulged, as it is the privilege of God to discern the secrets of the heart. H.  
**11** *Men.* They acknowledged greater and less gods. Stanley, p. 13. C. i.—They pretend not to have any communication with the superior ones, ( C.) and by their answer unguardedly bear testimony to the excellence of the God whom Daniel served. S. Jer.  
**13** *Slain.* Lit. “were slaughtering;” *interficiebantur* *.* H.—Many think that some had already suffered. Geier. M.—The had been perhaps jealous of Daniel, and had not informed him of the matter. S. Jer.  
**14** *General.* He occupied the same office as Putiphar, in Egypt. Gen. 39:1. It was no disgrace for such a one to execute himself the king’s order, as Banaias slew the brother of Solomon. 3 K. 2.  
**15** *Cruel.* Chal. also, “precipitate.” C.  
**16** *Declare* the dream. H.—The Chaldeans had promised only to explain it, and the king knew the superior merit of Daniel. C. 1:19. C.  
**18** *Secret.* Lit. “sacrament.” Gr. “mystery,” which seems to be derived from ( C.) mosthor, “a secret.” H.  
**19** *Night*, while he was probably asleep, ( C.) or praying with his companions. Villet.  
**20** *His.* He grants them to whom he pleases, and disposes of kingdoms ( C.) without control. v. 21.  
**27** *Soothsayers.* Chal. Gazerin, ( H.) who inspect entrails, (Ezec. 21:21. S. Jer.) or tell fortunes by sticks. C. 3:3.  
**28** *Times.* In the Old Test. this commonly signifies when Christ shall appear; but in the New, it refers to the end of the world. C.  
**29** *Begin.* By thus telling what thoughts the king had entertained before his dream, he would be heard with greater confidence. W.  
**31** *Terrible*, or unusual. C.—The statue denoted the four great empires of the Chaldees, Persians, Greeks and Romans. The metals did not mean that the empire of *gold* was greater than the rest, as that signified by *iron* was far more powerful; but only that the empire of the Chaldees was then the greatest, and that the Persians would acquire still more power and be surpassed by the Greeks, as they were by the Romans, till the kingdom of Christ should be spread over all the earth. W.  
**37** *Of kings.* This title was used by the Persians. Nabuchodonosor was at that time the most potent monarch on earth. He conquered many nations, and greatly embellished the city of Babylon, surrounding it with three walls in fifteen days, and building hanging gardens, which were the wonder of the world. See Eus. præp. ix. 41. and x. 42. &c. C.  
**39** *Another kingdom;* viz. that of the Medes and Persians. Ch.—*Inferior;* later, of less duration and extent. C.—*Third*, &c. That of Alexander the Great. Ch.—*World.* Alexander received ambassadors at Babylon, from the most distant nations, testifying their submission. He conquered beyond the river Indus, &c. Diod. A. 1. Olym. 14. C.  
**40** *The fourth kingdom*, &c. Some understand this of the successors of Alexander, the kings of Syria and Egypt: others, of the Roman empire and its civil wars. Ch.—The former supposition seems best, though the latter is almost universally received, and will be explained hereafter. C.—The Roman empire did not immediately rise out of Alexander’s, and had no relation to the Jews, &c. Grot. L’Empereus.—But it surely swallowed up all that he had left to his generals, and proved the greatest scourge to the Jewish nation; which has been ever since scattered, while the kingdom of Christ gains ground, and will flourish till that of Rome shall be no more. Antichrist will then appear to cast a cloud over, but not destroy it for three years and a half. It is the opinion of many Fathers, &c. that the Roman empire will subsist till that event take place; (see 2 Thes. 2:3. 7.) and thus it may be said, that the fourth empire shall not be given *to another people.* For antichrist will not strive to exalt a particular nation, but to rule over all. Yet his dominion will be short, and will end in the general dissolution of nature; so that the Roman empire maybe deemed to last for a long time, or even *for ever.* v. 44. Those who adopt the former system, allow ( H.) that the *stone* designates both the Roman empire and that of Christ; so that some parts of the prediction may refer to one and some to the other. The origin and progress of the Roman empire, might be a figure of the spiritual power of the Church. It is certain that the successors of Alexander owed their dominion to their valour, and established it by the slaughter of many great generals. The kings who followed Seleucus and Ptolemy were remarkable for a mixture of good and bad qualities. Their efforts to preserve their power by intermarriages, proved abortive. The prophet seems also to have had them in view, C. 7:7 and 8:22. C.  
**41** *Clay.* The iron was in a rude state, mixed with earth. The Roman power was at last partly exercised by consuls and partly by emperors. M.—Florus (l.) compares it to the four states of a man, infancy, childhood, youth, and old age. Its youth may be dated from the conquest of all Italy to Tiberius; afterwards it fell to decay, while the eternal kingdom of Christ was forming. v. 44.  
**43** *Man.* Pompey and Cæsar, Anthony and Augustus, married each other’s relations; but they soon quarrelled, and the race of the Cæsars was extinct in Nero. But this is better understood of the kings of Syria and of Egypt. C.  
**44** *Kingdom* of Christ, in the Catholic Church, which cannot be destroyed. Ch.—This alone cannot be destroyed. W.—All other empires change. The Catholic Church has stood for seventeen centuries in the midst of persecutions, which gives us an assurance that she will continue for ever. C.—“Then,” says Munster, “was the kingdom of Christ set up, not by arms, … but by the divine power.” This interpretation arises from the improper version, *without hands;* whereas the sequel shews that the empire here spoken of, is attended with the like violence as the four others, which it destroys. The Roman empire was in no degree connected with others by marriage. In the following verse, Munster improperly turns to the second coming of our Saviour. Grotius here asserts that the stone alludes to the Roman armies, prefiguring the Son of man, whose gospel is indicated by the progress of the Roman empire, as both sprung from small beginnings. But who informed him that there were such figures in that empire as in the Old Testament? All empires begin in that manner, and types should have some greater resemblance with the reality. The Church meddles not with the temporal powers. It is therefore plain that the prophet speaks of empires which shall succeed each other. Houbigant. perf. Prop. 340.—*Kingdoms.* That of Rome comprised all the former. The persecuting emperors are forced to yield, and the colossal power of infidelity and vice falls before the gospel. Christ’s dominion is spiritual, exercised against wickedness; ( C.) is heavenly and eternal. H.—The blood of martyrs was more efficacious in the establishing of Christianity, than fire and sword had been in forming other empires. M.  
**45** *Hands.* Prot. marg. “mountain, which was not in hand.” H.—Christ was born of a virgin; and his kingdom was not established by ambition, like others. Yet it presently became a mountain, and filled the earth. S. Just. dial. S. Aug. tr. 9. in Jo.—*God* himself sets up this *kingdom.* C.  
**46** *Daniel*, taking him for a little god, under the great one, v. 17. W.—*Victims.* Chal. mincha, ( H.) of flour, &c. But the prophet had already declared his sentiments on this head, (v. 28) and abhorred such honours, like S. Paul, (Acts 14:10. C.) though this is not here recorded. M.  
**47** *Of gods*, above all those of the country for explaining hidden things: yet he did not acknowledge him to be the only true God. C.—He afterwards erected an idol to represent his own greatness. W.  
**48** *Provinces*, or that of Babylonia, which was the first.—*W* *ise men.* This would not engage him in any idolatrous practices.  
**49** *Works* of agriculture, ( C.) which the ancient kings of Persia encouraged with great attention, appointing officers to reward or punish according as their land was cultivated. Xenophon, Cyr. 8. & Œcon.—S. Jerom thinks they were appointed judges, ( C.) or assistants of Daniel. Grot.—*Palace.* Lit. “gates,” ( H.) as receiver of the taxes, particularly at Susa. C. 8:2. Marsham Egypt. sæc. 18.

## Chapter 3

**1** *Statue.* It was the figure of a man, ( C.) the dimensions 90 feet high and 9 broad ( W.) being disproportionate; though a man might be represented on the pillar. Some take it for Nabolpolassar, ( C.) or for the king himself. S. Jer. W.—But he never complains of the injury shewn to his own person, and therefore it probably was meant for Bel, the chief god. C. 4:5 and 14:1. This nation adored statues. Bar. 6:3. The Persians worshipped only the elements. C.—Ochus first set up the statue of the goddess Tanais or Anais. Clem. Protr.—*Dura.* Sept. “enclosed.” S. Jer.—This happened towards the end of the king’s reign, (v. 98, &c.) of course the three young men might be about fifty years old. C.  
**2** *Nobles.* Lit. “satraps,” or, “the king’s domestics.” Sept. in 1 Esd. 8:36.—*Judges*, or “governors of provinces.” ib. Theodotion, &c.—*Captains* of the soothsayers.—*Rulers;* “tyrants,” here denoting treasurers. C.—*Governors.* Lit. “the grandees who were in power;” ( H.) counsellors. The original adds, ( C.) Thopthia, ( H.) “lawyers” and orators. The head of the Turkish religion is called muphti, from the root, ( C.) *peti*, “to teach.” H.  
**5** *Symphony.* This and several other terms seem taken from the Greek, though the scythara and *sambuca* came originally from Chaldea. C.—*Down.* This and offering incense were sometimes considered as marks of idolatry; so being present at the sermons and churches of Protestants was a sign of joining in their communion, being required for that purpose. W.  
**8** *Jews:* the three children whom they viewed with a jealous eye. Daniel was too much exalted, or was absent with other Jews.  
**15** *Hand?* Proof of this king’s inconstancy, as he had witnessed the power of God!  
**18** *He.* Chal. “not” C.—By this modest yet resolute answer, they testified their faith in God’s power, and their determination rather to suffer death ( W.) than to go against their conscience. H.—They were ignorant whether God would preserve them from the flames or not, ( W.) as he is said to have rescued Abraham from a similar danger. 2 Esd. 9:7.  
**20** *Strongest.* Chal. “mighty in strength;” ( H.) his own guards, the usual executioners.  
**21** *Coats*, or various coloured bandages for the thighs, used by men and women. Aquila and Th. retain the original term, Σαραβαροις. Chal. saraballa. C.—*Caps:* “tiaras.” H.—The king alone wore them upright.  
**22** *Slew.* They were working still at the furnace, when it burst out and destroyed them, ( C.) while the three Jews were praising God below. H. v. 46, 48.  
**24** *And*, &c. “What follows I have not found in the Heb. volumes.” S. Jer. H.—Here S. Jerom takes notice, that from this verse to v. 91 was not in the Heb. in his time. But as it was in all the Greek Bibles, (which were originally translated from the Hebrew) it is more than probable that it had been formerly in the Hebrew; or rather in the Chaldaic, in which the Book of Daniel was written. But this is certain: that it is and has been of old, received by the Church, and read as canonical Scripture in her liturgy and divine offices. Ch.—See the pref. W.  
**27** *True;* not fickle, and liable to change. C.—*Opera mutas non mutas consilium* *.* S. Aug. Conf. i. 4.—Cappel. argues from this confession, that the piece is not divine, as they would rather have burst out into expressions of admiration, as they do in the canticle below. But they had done so already, (v. 26) and make this confession, ( H.) as Daniel does, C. 9; reflecting, that if the nation had not transgressed, they would not thus have been exposed to the fury of the king. Houbigant. v. 40. H.  
**33** **Ver** **.** **33** **.** *Thee.* Pagans take occasion to vilify our religion.  
**34** *Sake.* This disinterested motive is often urged. Jos. 7:9 and 2 Mac. 8:15. C.  
**35** *One.* Moses used the like terms, and pacified God. Ex. 32. W.  
**38** *Thee*, in Jerusalem, ( H.) or Judea. There were chiefs and judges, (C. 13) as well as prophets, (Ezech. &c.) among the captives. Yet the republic was in disorder. C.—Sedecias was dead, Joakim in prison, so that no Jewish king ruled over the people; nor was there any prophet in the promised land, Jeremias being either dead or in Egypt. W.—Prophets were at least very rare. M.  
**40** **Ver** **.** **40** **.** *Sacrifice* of ourselves. H.—They knew not yet whether they would escape. When they beheld the angel they had greater confidence, and broke forth into a hymn of praise. Houbig.—They now offer all they can, a humble heart!  
**43** *Name*, by rescuing us, that all may confess thy power. C.  
**46** *Brimstone.* Lit. naphtha, ( H.) or bitumen, which was very inflammable.—*Tow*, besmeared with pitch. C.—*Dry (* *malleolis* *)* “bundles” of sticks, or ropes, covered with pitch. H.—*Manipuli spartœi pice contecti* *.* Nonius.  
**48** *Furnace.* These might be other victims, ( H.) or he recapitulates what had been said v. 22, ( C.) which is by no means unusual, though Cappel. would hence reject the piece. Houbigant.  
**49** *Furnace:* so that it destroyed the Chaldeans, while it had no power to hurt God’s servants. The operation of the laws nature was thus only restrained. H.  
**53** *Temple;* heaven, styled the throne, v. 54. The temple was now in ruins.  
**55** *Depths*, from whom nothing is hidden.—*Cherubims*, as on thy chariot.  
**65** *Spirits:* winds. Angels and men are mentioned elsewhere. C.—They rejoice that the angels always praise God, and wish that all would strive to imitate them. W.  
**67** *Heat.* Winter and summer. Some copies have, *æstas* *.* C.  
**72** *Darkness.* The privation of light has its use, and invites men to praise. S. Aug. de nat. Boni. 16. W.  
**86** *Souls*, in a separate state. Angels are invited before. C.  
**88** *Ananias*, &c. They retain their Hebrew names, despising those imposed by the Chaldeans, with their impious manners. C. 1:7. The inanimate creation is invited to praise God in its way, (Ps. 148) as well as those endued with reason. The former never refuse obedience. H.—*Hell:* the grave. C.  
**90** *And ever.* “Hitherto does not occur in Heb.; and what we have written, is translated from the edition of Theodotion.” S. Jer. v. 24.  
**91** *Then* hearing these praises, and seeing people walking in the fire. Grabe’s edit. after v. 24, has only, “And Nabuchodonosor heard them singing hymns, and was, “&c.  
**92** *The son*, or rather ( H.) “a son;” νιω. Lowth’s Gram.—He supposed this was some angel or petty god, like Hercules. Carthus.—It was the same angel who descended ( W.) with them v. 49. Some have taken him for Jesus Christ. But S. Aug. observes, that most of these apparitions were made by angels, (Trin. iii. 11.) who are often styled “sons of God.” Job 1:6. T. C.  
**94** *Smell*, such as is felt when people, ( H.) or their garments, come too near the fire. Pagans have sometimes walked through fire; but they first anointed their feet with certain preservatives, as Servius (in Æn. xi.) remarks from Varro. C.—Here the fire burnt only the bands, (v. 23, 92. H.) God making his creatures afford comfort to his servants, as was the case when the Goths attempted to burn S. Benedict. S. Greg. Dial. iii. 18. W.  
**95** *Changed*, refusing to comply against their better knowledge. The force of reason extorts this concession from the wicked king. H.  
**96** *Des* *troyed.* Chal. “torn limb from limb, ( C.) and their houses be made a dunghill.” C. 2:5. H.—*Manner.* One would suppose that he was really converted; but his heart was not changed. C. 4. C.  
**97** *Promo* *ted.* He granted them greater power: ( W.) or Chal. “re-established” them in their former dignities. Rom. Gr. “He elevated them in honour, and judged them worthy to rule over all the Jews in his kingdom.” Theod.  
**98** *Nabuchodonosor*, &c. These three last verses are a kind of preface to the following chapter, which is written in the style of an epistle from the king. Ch.—It was probably published in consequence of this miracle. Here the chap. might properly commence, ( C.) as it does in Heb. and Prot. Bibles. H.

## Chapter 4

**1** *Palace.* He continues the edict, having subdued all his enemies. C.—Daniel recites his words. The king had the *dream* in the 34th year of his reign, which continued in all forty-three, including the seven of absence. W.  
**5** *Colleague.* Chal. also, “another, *or* afterwards, ( H.) or at last.” C.—*My god.* He says this, because the name of *Baltassar*, or *Belteshazzar*, is derived from the name of *Bel*, the chief god of the Babylonians. Ch.—*Gods.* He speaks conformably to his false opinion; (S. Jer.) or, being instructed by Daniel, he testifies that the Holy Spirit enlightens the prophet. Theod. Gr. has “god,” which S. Jerom disapproves; though the plural is often used for the true God. Reason evinces that only the Deity can disclose the secrets of futurity. Gen. 41:38. C.  
**6** *A* *nd the.* He is convinced that Daniel could do both, but condescends now to relate his dream. H.  
**7** *Tree* often denotes princes; (Ezec. 31:3) and according to the false principles ( C.) of those who pretend to explain dreams, always ( H.) implies some great personage. Achmet. C. 200. Grot.—But nothing is more vain than these pretensions. C.  
**10** *A watcher.* A vigilant angel, perhaps the guardian of Israel. Ch.—Chal. *hir* *;* ( H.) whence Iris the messenger of the gods, is derived. S. Jer.—Theodot. retains eir. See S. Jer. in Ps. lxxvi. 4. The Scholiast (Rom. ed.) says: “the Sept. renders it an *a* *ngel*, the rest a *watcher.*” These supernatural agents H. and *saints* are represented as judges. v. 14. C.  
**11** *Branches*, to shew that all ( H.) the king’s subjects should abandon him.  
**12** *Let it*, the tree, representing the king who was confined when he began to shew signs of madness: but he broke loose, and fled away. C.  
**13** *Changed*, &c. It does not appear, by Scripture, that Nabuchodonosor was changed from human shape, much less that he was changed into an ox, but only that he lost his reason, and became mad; and in this condition remained abroad in the company of beasts, eating grass like an ox, till his hair grew in such a manner as to resemble the feathers of an eagle, and his nails to be like birds’ claws. Ch.—Origen represents the whole as an allegorical description of the fall of Lucifer. See S. Jer. But his arguments have made little impression: and it is universally believed that Nabuchodonosor was thus punished for his pride, after a whole year had been allowed him to see if he would repent. The manner of this strange metamorphose has been variously explained. But it seems that he was seized with the species of madness styled Lycanthropy, ( C.) as Virgil (Ec. 6:4–8) relates of the daughters of Prœtus, who “with mimick’d mooings fill’d the fields.” H.—Thus many fancy they are kings, or horses, ( C.) and that they are continually mounting above the clouds, of which we have an instance in a woman still living at Whitby, who in other respects appears to be sufficiently sensible, ( H.) as Tertullian and others think Nabuchodonosor was, that he might suffer more. Yet it is commonly supposed he lost his senses for a while, till God was pleased to restore them at the time appointed; when his former humiliating state might make a deep impression upon his mind, as well as upon his subjects, and caution all future generations to guard against the fatal consequences of pride. His son, Evilmerodac, probably ruled during his absence. Most of the Chaldee writings have perished; so that we need not be surprised if they take no notice of this event, wheich was so disgraceful to the nation. Yet Megasthenes, (in Eus. præp. ix. ultra) seems to hint at it, when he represents the king seized with a divine fury, and crying out: ( C. Diss.) “I, the same Nabuchodonosor, foretell unto you, Babylonians, a fatal calamity, which neither my ancestor Belus, nor even the kingdom of Bel, ( H. *the gods*) have power to avert. For a Persian mule (*Cyrus.* C.) shall come, assisted by your demons, and bring on slavery … Having uttered this oracle, he suddenly disappeared.” H.—*Be* *ast’s heart.* In his hypochondriac temper he imagined himself ( C.) to be an ox, ( H.) avoided the society of men, going naked and feeding on grass, upon his hands and feet, till (after seven years) God restored him to his senses and kingdom. W.—The food which he used would tend to purge him, and naturally abate the disorder. Barthol.—Yet none but God could tell precisely when the madness would seize or leave him.—*Times.* This usually denotes years, in Daniel; (7:25 and 12:7) and of course ( C.) we must understand it here in this sense; ( W.) though some have explained it of an indeterminate length of time, or of weeks, months, or seasons. Only winter and summer were admitted, so that his period would thus suffice. See Theod. C.  
**14** *Over it.* Kings are not always of the most noble dispositions. H.—“All honour comes from Jove.” Homer. Ili. 17.—Let the greatest monarchs be humble, ( H.) and cast their crowns at the feet of God. C.  
**16** *Hour.* Chal. shaha, ( H.) implies “a little while;” (Grot.) yet of some duration, not precisely like one of the modern hours. The prophet was silent, being troubled by the divine spirit, (C. 10:8) at the view of impending misery; or unwilling to hurt the king’s feelings, till he should urge him to speak. C.—He was sorry to denounce such calamities, yet must speak the truth. W.—*Trouble.* Theodot. “make thee hurry.” He perceived the prophet’s anxiety, and encouraged him.  
**23** *Remain.* His son and the nobles should act in his name. v. 13.  
**24** *Alms.* Chal. “justice,” is often taken in this sense. Syr. &c. 2 Cor. 9:9. C.—The prediction was conditional, and therefore Daniel exhorts the king to strive to obtain pardon by the powerful remedy of alms-deeds; as he did, after enduring some punishment. W.—Yet this is very doubtful. v. 31.  
**25** *Came.* Daniel informs us of this event, unless the king speak of himself in the third person, from v. 16 to 31, giving an account of what he had heard and experienced. H.—A year of trial was allowed him at first; (Theod.) or he obtained this reprieve by his alms, and lost his former merit by relapsing into pride. S. Jer.  
**27** *Answered* his own vain thoughts. H.—He was admiring the city, ( C.) which he had greatly enlarged and beautified. Berosus &c.  
**31** *Heaven:* God having looked on me with pity. S. Aug. (ep. 111. C. or 122. W.) seems to think that he was saved; and the author of the B. on Pred. & grace, (c. 15) attributes to him, remarks that his repentance was different from that of Pharao. Hence none must despair. S. Jer. ep. vii. to Læta.—See Theod. A. Lap. &c. who maintain that same opinion: but S. Thomas expresses his doubts. Isaias (14:9) seems to condign him to *hell;* and the king here manifests his adhesion to *Bel*, (v. 5) and great inconstancy. C. 2:47 and 3:15. His conviction seems therefore to have been only in speculation, ( C.) or momentary, like that of the philosophers, (Rom. 1) which would render them more criminal; and we must confess, ( H.) that this conversion is very equivocal. Sanctius. v. 24 and 34. H.  
**32** *With*, or “by the powers (*angels.* v. 10.) … as by men.” Grot.—The stars are also frequently thus described. Mat. 24:29. The king probably believed that the God of the Jews was above his gods, the sun, fire, &c. C.  
**33** *Shape.* He had not assumed that of an ox, ( H.) but had greatly neglected his person, ( C.) so that he was covered with hair, &c. v. 30. H.  
**34** *I*, &c. From this place some commentators infer, that this king became a true convert, and dying not long after, was probably saved. Ch. Jos. Ant. 10—This is the last act of his which is recorded. If he had lived much longer, he would probably have restored the Jews. W.—But the time decreed by heaven for their liberation was not yet arrived. H.

## Chapter 5

**1** *Baltassar* *.* He is believed to be the same as Nabonides, the last of the Chaldean kings, grandson to Nabuchodonosor. He is called his son v. 2, 11, &c. according to the style of the Scriptures, because he was a descendant from him. Ch. S. Jer. in Is. xiii. Usher, &c.—Some think that he was brother of Evilmerodac. v. 11. Bar. 1:11. But he seems rather to have been his son. Jer. 27:7. Profane authors place Neriglissor and Laborosoarchod between them. They were not of the royal family, and might be looked upon as usurpers, or reigned in some other place; or they did not meddle with the Jews. C.—It is wonderful that Josephus should prefer these authors; ( T.) yet he abandons the dates given by them. Ant. x. 12. & c. Ap. 1. They represent Nabonides as a simple Babylonian raised to the throne, defeated by Cyrus, and suffered to retire into Carmania; whereas, Baltassar was slain. v. 29. C.—The others were of a different lineage, and are mentioned by Eus. &c. Evilmerodac certainly preceded him on the throne, and honoured Joachim in the 37th years of his captivity. W.—*Thousand;* or, “for his officers over a thousand men.” Theodot.—*Every.* Chal. “and drank wine before the thousand,” more than any, for this was deemed a great perfection; or he drank in their presence, but apart. C.—The Persian monarchs used to sit in a separate apartment, with a veil before the door, so that they could see the guests without being seen. A great chandelier was before them; (Athen. iv. 10.) probably on the outside, otherwise it would have defeated their purpose. Light sufficient would appear for Baltassar to see the hand-writing on his chamber wall. v. 5. H.—According to the order of time, this chapter should be placed after the 7 and 8. C.—But those contain visions. H.  
**6** *Loosed*, so that he quaked for fear. Ezec. 29:7. C.—He was not so drunk as to be deprived of sense. H.—This happened in the 17th and last year of his reign, when Daniel was about a hundred years old, ( W.) though we have no certain account of his age. H.—He might be eighty-two when he died. C.  
**7** *Purple.* This and the *chain* were reserved for the highest nobility.—*Third*, or one of the three great officers. C. 6:1 and 2 K. 23:8. 19.  
**8** *Read.* It was written in Samaritan characters; or, for want of vowels, could not be read or understood. C.  
**10** *The queen.* Not his wife, but the mother of the king; ( Ch.) Amyit, widow of Nabuchodonosor, and sister of Darius, the Mede; or ( C.) Nitocris, the mother of Labynithus, (Herod. i.) whom many confound with Baltassar. C.  
**11** *Father.* So a grandfather might be styled. Jer. 27:7. W.—Daniel was not perhaps at the head of the wise men. C.—They were too jealous to mention him; and the intoxicated king and courtiers remembered not his merit, till an aged matron suggested that he should be consulted. He was probably ( H.) in some office, at Susa, yet happened to be then in Babylon, ( C.) which was besieged; and thither he might have retired at the approached of Cyrus.  
**16** *Difficult.* Lit. “things which are tied,” or perplexing. H.—The Persians still used the like expressions, to imply an intelligent governor. Chardin.  
**17** *Another.* He does not refuse the offers, but civilly replies that he will give satisfaction without regard to any recompense.  
**19** *Slew.* He was an absolute monarch, and considered his subjects as so many slaves. C.—Xerxes having called together his nobles, that he might not seem to have resolved on the war with Greece alone, said: “Nevertheless, remember that you have to obey rather than to advise.” V. Max. 9. 5. 2.  
**21** *Beasts.* His disordered imagination made him dwell with them. W.—It is strange that such an example should have been so soon forgotten, that Daniel is forced to repeat it so explicitly. C. 4:13.  
**23** *Vessels.* Only part had been returned to Sedecias: (C. 1:2) but they were taken again, and kept in the palace, or in the temple of Bel. H.—*Breath*, or soul. Gen. 2:7. C.  
**25** *Pha* *res* *.* These words consist of three letters, mona, thokol, pros, as we add *o* merely for pronunciation. Being unconnected and almost destitute of vowels, ( H.) it is not easy even for the learned to read these words, or to ascertain their meaning. Thus *d b r* being placed in a similar situation, it would be impossible to determine the sense; as it may have ten different meanings, according as it is pronounced. v. 8. C.—*Mane* is twice repeated, to shew the certainty and exactitude of the numbering. M.—Yet in the sequel each word occurs once and unconnected, as it is here in the Vulg.; not *Mene, Mene,* *Tekel, Upharsin*, (Prot. H.) “He hath numbered, weighed, and the dividers *or* the Persians” are upon thee, ( T.) as Dalila said to Samson. Only three words ( H.) were written. S. Jer.—The rest contain the prophet’s explanation. The Chaldean empire had now attained its utmost height. Its king brought ruin upon himself by his wicked life. H.—He would soon be divided with the sword, and his kingdom shared between the Medes and Persians. S. Jer.  
**28** *Persians.* Those who confound Baltassar with Nabonides, say that Cyrus made himself master of all the empire. How then was it divided? Darius rather took possession of the greatest part while Cyrus had Persia, ( C.) till his uncle’s death. H.  
**29** *Third*, or over a third part. S. Jer. 5:7. H. The honours wee conferred without delay, and they would have been made public in the morning. But death prevented the king; and Daniel did not enjoy them till they were ratified by Darius, to whom he adhered. C.—The Medes then besieged the city, which they took that night, when most part were drunk. W.—It was a solemn festival. Is. 21. S. Jer.—Cyrus rushed in by the channel of the Euphrates, and two of the king’s guards slew him to revenge themselves. Xenoph. 7. Beros.  
**31** *Darius.* He is called *Cyaxares* by the historians, and was the son of Astyages, and uncle to Cyrus ( Ch.) as well as to Baltassar, by the mother’s side. He is styled Astyages, (C. 13:65) or Artaxerxes. Sept. C. 6:1. He takes the title of king both of the Medes and Persians. C. 6:8. &c. C.

## Chapter 6

**1** *Kingdom.* Josephus, &c. say Darius had returned into Media, where he made these regulations. But if this did not take place at Babylon, it would be rather at Susa. C. 8. Josephus counts 300 or 360 governments, though when the monarchy was increased there were only 127. Est. 1. C.—He may therefore speak here of large towns, which had each a magistrate. Such regulations easily vary. H.—Darius acts as master of the whole empire.  
**3** *Princes.* Th. “regulators.” Chal. sacecin, ( H.) may be put for ( C.) scranim, ( H.) the usual title ( C.) of the highest officers, the *surenas* of Persia. Ammian 30.  
**4** *Kingdom*, as prime minister, to whom the three princes should be accountable, as the inferior governors where to them. H.—The king was now advanced in years, and wished to ease himself of part of the burden, ( C.) as he could entirely confide in Daniel. H.—He reigned only one year. C. 13:65. W.—*King.* Chal. “kingdom,” ( H.) to accuse him of treason, (Grot.) or to get him removed. C.—This is an old and malignant trick, to call religion treason, and to get laws made for that purpose. W.—*In him* a great proof of integrity! M.  
**6** *Craftily.* Chal. “came tumultuously to,” &c. C.—They hoped thus to convince the king, as they were so unanimous. He would not perceive the drift of their petition, and was flattered with the idea of being like a god. Daniel was not consulted, though on other occasions the king reposed such confidence in him, as the deputies so impudently asserted that the wish was universal! So easily are princes deceived! H.  
**8** *It*, when it is confirmed both by the king and his nobility. Est. 8:8.  
**9** *It.* Nabuchodonosor of Babylon, and of Ninive, had both pretended to be gods; (C. 3:15. Judith 6:2–9. C.) and Curtius (8) remarks, “that the Persians follow the dictates of prudence as well as of piety, in worshipping their kings among the gods, the majesty of empire being its best protection.” H.  
**10** *Before.* He did not open the windows that he might be seen, as that would have been rashness; nor did many perceive what he was doing, (v. 11. W.) as it was in an *upper room*, but only those who rushed in. H.—It was the usual practice of the Jews, ( C.) to pray turning towards the temple, as Solomon had directed, (3 K. 8:48. S. Jer. in Ezec. viii. 16.) though it was now in ashes. H.—Daniel observed the third, sixth, and ninth hours, as the Church still does. Acts 2:15 and 10:9. S. Jer.  
**11** *Carefully.* Chal. “came in a tumultuous manner.” as v. 6. & 15. C.  
**15** *Perceiving.* Chal. “assembled,” (Prot. H.) or “came quickly in a body.” C.  
**17** *Own ring*, that none of his enemies might injure Daniel. The nobles also affixed their seal, ( H.) that the king might not liberate him. M.—All this shews that aristocracy was mixed with the monarchical form of government. Nothing of importance is done without the nobles.  
**18** *Meat.* Chal. “music,” ( C.) or “incense.” De Dieu.—He was tired of his godship, to which he had unguardedly opened his heart. v. 6. H.  
**22** *Offence*, as I neglected thy decree to obey a higher Master. C.—The king had sense enough to approve of this distinction. H.  
**23** *Believed*, or trusted. C.—S. Paul alludes to this miracle. Heb. 11:33. W.  
**24** *Accused.* They were punished as false witnesses; ( C.) and the king justly made them suffer what they would have inflicted on the innocent, being convinced that Daniel had only acted according to his devotion. W.—These wretches deserved to perish, though they had spoken nothing but the truth. H.—*Wives.* Many examples of such punishments occur, ( C.) as it was presumed that children and wives were infected by the bad example, and would imitiate it, (Jun.) if they had not concurred already. M.—This must have been the case, to make it just. H. See Jos. 7.—*Abominandœ leges*, says Ammianus, (23) speaking of the customs of Persia, *per quas ob noxam unius omnis propinquitas perit* *.* C.

## Chapter 7

**1** *Baltassar* *.* Chal. a letter is wanting. H.—This Baltassar was slain. C. 5. C.—The two visions happened before that event. W.—*The.* Prot. “visions of his head, upon his bed. Then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.” H.  
**2** *Winds*, to imply the tumults occasioned by fresh kingdoms ( W.) in the world. Theod.  
**3** *Four great beasts;* viz. the Chaldean, Persian, Grecian, and Roman empires. But some rather choose to understand the fourth beast of the successors of Alexander the great, more especially of them that reigned in Asia and Syria, ( Ch.) or in Egypt. C. 2:40. H.  
**4** *Man.* The emperors of Babylon were forced to confess that they were nothing more. C.—Their cruel and rapid conquests ( W.) are denoted by this monstrous animal. Its wings shew how the lands were divided between the Medes and Persians. Perhaps Neriglissor, &c. shared a part. C. 5:1. C.  
**5** *Bear*, which is cruel, and eats what is set before it greedily. W.—*Side.* Cyrus did not attack the Jews. S. Jer.—He stood ready to attack the Chaldeans.—*Three.* He ruled over the Medes and Chaldeans, as well as over the Persians. C.—*Rows.* Gr. “wings or sides” of an animal, ( H.) or “bones.” Grot.—Cyrus was always at war; and Justin (1.) says, that Tomyris II. of Scythia, ordered his head to be cut off, and thrown into a vessel full of blood. His troops are styled robbers, Jer. 51:48. The ambition of Cambyses, Hystaspes, &c. are insatiable.  
**6** *Leopard*, a small spotted beast, may denote the size and disposition of Alexander, as well as his rapid conquests. When he was asked how he had subdued so many, he answered, “by never putting off.” C.—*Four.* He led his forces on all sides; ( H.) and after his death, his empire was divided into four, ( W.) Egypt, Syria, Asia, and Macedon, (Theod.) as he had united in his person the empire of the Chaldees, Medes, Persians, and Greeks. C.  
**7** *Unlike.* It is not named: but shews the incomparable power of the Romans, governed by kings, consuls, tribunes, dictators, emperors, at different times. W.—This in the opinion generally received, which we shall explain. Yet many think that the kingdoms of Syria and Egypt are designated, as C. 2:40. S. Jerom acknowledged that what is understood of antichrist, had been partly verified in Epiphanes, his figure. The beast was to be slain before the coming of the Son of man. v. 11, 26. It would persecute for three years and a half; but God would grant victory to his saints, as he did to the Machabees. Yet they only exhibited a faint idea of what has been done by the Church. The same subject is treated, C. 11. Many things caused the dominion of the successors of Alexander to be unlike that of others. It was never united, and was very destructive to the Jews. C.—*Horns.* That is, ten kingdoms, (as Apoc. 17:12) among which the empire of the fourth beast shall be parcelled: or ten kings of the number of the successors of Alexander, as figures of such as shall be about the time of antichrist. Ch.—Epiphanes was the eighth king, and Laomedon, Antigonus, and Demetrius, had been governors of Syria before. Most understand this of antichrist, whom Epiphanes foreshewed. Others think that it points out Vespasian, the tenth successor of Cæsar, who made war on the Jews. The same prediction may regard different events, as the *abomination* (C. 9) may allude to the profanations committed by Epiphanes, by the Romans at the last siege, and by antichrist. Others apply this to the Turkish empire, which may be paving the way for the great antagonist of Christ. C. Dioclesian and Julian may also be meant, as well as other forerunners of the *man of sin.* H.—He shall overcome many, but his fury shall continue but a short time. v. 25. W.  
**8** *Little horn.* This is commonly understood of antichrist. It may also be applied to that great persecutor, Antiochus Epiphanes, as a figure of antichrist. Ch.—He was the youngest son of Antiochus the great, and was a hostage of Rome. While he was returning, his elder brother died, and Epiphanes excluded his son Philometor, of Egypt, and the usurper Heliodorus. He also defeated *three*, Philometor, on the *south;* Artaxias, king of Armenia, on the *east;* and *the s* *trength*, or God’s people, v. 24 and C. 8:9.—*Man.* He gained several at first, by his affability.—*Things:* blasphemy. 1 Mac. 1:23. 43. C.  
**9** *Ancient.* The Son is born of the Father, and the Holy Ghost proceeds from both, yet all three are coeternal. W.—Hence the Father is sometimes painted in this manner, though he be a pure spirit. His throne resembled that seen by Ezechiel, C. 1. H.—He takes cognizance of all, and punishes accordingly. C.  
**10** *Fire.* Ps. 96:3.—*Thousands.* Gr. implies one million and one hundred millions. M.—The angels are very numerous, particularly the highest, styled assistants. S. Tho. W.  
**11** *Spoke.* I wished to see how the king would be punished. He felt the hand of God as he was going to destroy all the Jews, when he pretended to repent. 1 Mac. 6 and 2 Mac. 9:4. His successors could not much disturb the Jews. v. 13. C.  
**12** *Time.* Each of the four empires had its period assigned. That of Rome attracted the prophet’s attention most, and is mentioned first. M.  
**13** *Heaven.* Christ appeared about sixty years after the subversion of the Syrian monarchy. Yet these expressions literally refer to his second coming. Mat. 26:64. C.—He had the form of man, as he had the nature. M.—He is clearly predicted. by his power antichrist is overthrown. W.  
**14** *Destroyed.* The eternal dominion of Christ could not be expressed in stronger terms. He seems to allude to them, Mat. 28:18. C.  
**17** *Earth.* The first was on the point of disappearing. C. 5:31. H.  
**18** *Most High*, (Th.) or rather Chal. “the very high saints of God;” as also v. 22, 25, and 27.  
**21** *Saints.* The Machabees at last prevailed. Christ will punish the Jews. Mat. 24:30.  
**23** *Greater.* Chal. “unlike,” as v. 7. Epiphanes was a *greater* scourge of the Jews than any of the preceding.  
**24** *Mightier.* Chal. again, “unlike.” Antiochus the great had lost many provinces: but his son was the most implacable enemy of God’s people. He subdued them, Egypt and Armenia; or his three competitors. v. 8.  
**25** *Against*, or “over against,” like an accuser. Sym. “as if he were God.”—*Laws.* He did this with regard to the Jews, (1 Mac. 1:41. C.) prohibiting their festivals. Antichrist will do the like, and pretend to work miracles. H.—*A time*, &c. That is, three years and a half; which is supposed to be the length of the duration of the persecution of antichrist. Ch. Apoc. 11:2 and 12:14.—Josephus (Bel. pref.) says the sacrifices were discontinued so long, or rather this time elapsed from the publishing his edict till the temple was purified. During six months, people offered sacrifice clandestinely. 1 Mac. 4:36. 52.  
**27** *Him.* The power of the Machabees was too limited, to be here understood. The Church and Christ must be meant.  
**28** *Word.* The angel spoke no more at this time. C.

## Chapter 8

**1** *Beginning.* This vision was to explain what he had seen C. 7 respecting the four monarchies. The conflict of the Persians with Alexander, after two hundred years and twenty years, is here described. W.  
**2** *Castle;* some read “city.” Here the kings had a palace; and Hystaspes, &c. generally resided in it. Nabuchodonosor seems to have subdued Elam. Cyrus had it for his share; but Darius, the Mede, appears from Eschylus to have plundered Susa again. Daniel probably spent the latter part of his life in this city. C.—*Gate*, or “stagnant water;” (*paludem* *.* v. 3. H.) though most understand the river Euleus, on the side of Susiana. The prophets often sought retired places. C. 10:4. Ezec. 1:1. C.  
**3** *A ram.* The empire of the Medes and Persians. Ch. W.—Cyrus, the founder, was allied to both.—*Higher*, denoting the Persians; or Hystaspes, and his posterity, the second branch of the royal family, which reigned to the end: whereas Cambyses was the only one of the race of Cyrus who succeeded to the throne. Others think that he alludes to Codomannus, whom Alexander certainly attacked.—*Afterward* is not in Heb. S. Jerom supposed that another *ram* was designated, but it is the same.  
**4** *South.* Codomannus reigned in peace for two years, when he was invaded. But his predecessors had made war chiefly in Greece, Scythia, and Egypt. The stupendous preparations of Xerxes against Greece only accelerated the fall of his own kingdom, by irritating the two nations. C.  
**5** *A he-goat.* The empire of the Greeks, or Macedonians.—*He touched not the ground.* He conquered all before him with so much rapidity, that he seemed rather to fly than to walk upon the earth.—*A notable horn.* Alexander the great. Ch.—He succeeded his father when only twenty years old, and the next year was chosen generalissimo of the Greeks against Persia, which he invaded at the head of 30,000 foot and 4,000 horses, having only seventy talents of silver and provisions for one month. With this he attacked the most flourishing empire, and conquered it in less than four years’ time, when Darius was slain. A. 3674. Alexander survived only six years and ten months, yet subdued so many nations that it is almost incredible that he should have travelled over them. He is the belly of brass and the leopard, C. 2:39 and 7:6. C.—He died in the midst of his prosperity, ( H.) when not quite thirty-three years old, ( W.) and left no heirs to succeed him. This conqueror would be painted with two horns, to intimate that he was the son of Jupiter Ammon. C.  
**7** *Hand.* He routed all the forces of his enemy ( H.) at the Granicus, at Issus; and at Gaugamela, ( C.) or Arbela, Darius escaped, but was slain by his own servants. H.—The clemency of the conqueror towards the fallen royal family is not here specified. C.  
**8** *Broken*, by death. Usher, A. 3681.—*Four.* Seleucus, Antigonus, Philip, and Ptolemeus, the successors of Alexander, who divided his empire among them. Ch.—Other generals held out for some time. Philip was only a nominal king; Antipater governed Macedon and Greece. Syria, Asia, and Egypt, formed three other kingdoms. All four marked out by the four heads of the leopard. C. 7:6. But the prophet is intent upon Syria and Egypt, which had most to do with the Jews. C.  
**9** *A little horn.* Antiochus Epiphanes, a descendant of Seleucus. He grew against the south and the east, by his victories over the kings of Egypt and Armenia; and *against the strength*, that is, against Jerusalem and the people of God. Ch.—He persecuted God’s people, and set up the idol of Jupiter Olympius in the very temple. W.  
**10** *Even unto*, or against the strength of heaven. So are here called the army of the Jews, the people of God, ( Ch.) and particularly the teachers. Many priests gave way to idolatry. 1 Mac. 1:48 and 2 Mac. 4:14. C.  
**11** *Strength;* the God of armies, ( H.) over whom Epiphanes seemed to triumph.  
**12** *Strength.* Heb. “the army was delivered up to him, for the,” &c. While several contended for the high priesthood, and imitated the manners of the Greeks, the sacrifices were neglected, and then Antiochus prevailed. 2 Mac. 4:7.—*Ground.* The ambitious pontiffs, as well as the king and his officers, kept not their promises. Onias, the lawful high priest, being displaced, went to seek redress at Antioch, in the asylum at Daphne. Andronicus prevailed on him to come out by treacherous promises, and slew him; whereupon even Epiphanes wept, and ordered the murderer to be punished. 2 Mac. 4:32. The following year he entered Jerusalem, and committed horrible profanations.  
**13** *Another.* We do not inquire how the angels explained themselves, or whether they instruct each other. This conversation was for the prophet’s information. C.—One angel asked the other a question about futurity. W.  
**14** *Days.* That is, six years and almost four months; which was the whole time from the beginning of the persecution of Antiochus till his death. Ch.—He began A. 143, and died A. 149, according to the era of Seleucus. H.—The temple was purified in the mean time. 1 Mac. 1:21 and 6:16. W.—Full days are specified. Sacrifice entirely ceased for three years, A. 145. C. 7:25. Sym. has 2,400, others 2,200, as quoted by S. Jerom. We know not whether the solar year of 365 days, or the lunar of 354, be meant.  
**17** *Man.* So Ezechiel is usually styled, to shew that the human nature is different from that of angels, and would be greatly honoured by Jesus Christ, who takes this appellation. W.—*Of the end*, or determined. This shall take place, ( C.) but the period is distinct. Grot. v. 26.  
**19** *Malediction.* Hebrew: “wrath” against the people of God, and their enemies. C.  
**21** *Is.* Heb. “*are* the kings,” ( H.) including all. v. 3.  
**22** *Nation*, yet not his children. v. 8.  
**23** *Shameless.* Heb. “hard,” cruel, and impudent, as Epiphanes was. 1 Mac. 1:2. Marcellinus styles him “wrathful and savage.”—*Sentences*, making use of artifice to seize the estates of his nephew Philometor, and to oppress the Jews. 2 Mac. 5:24. C.—The history speaks of Antiochus: antichrist is also meant, as C. 12 and Mat. 24. W.  
**24** *By.* Heb. “not to his (Alexander’s) strength.” v. 22. Epiphanes conquered Egypt and the Jews: but the former had an infant king, and the latter were unprovided. He shewed more cunning than prowess.  
**25** *Prince:* God.—*Hand* of man. He confessed that he was justly punished. 1 Mac. 6:10. Gr. “He shall raise himself by the ruin of many, (Theod. and some MSS. add, *and shall rise* up *against the prince of princes*) and he shall break them like eggs with his hand.”  
**26** *Morning* of this day, or of what shall happen in certain full days. v. 14.—*Seal.* When the predictions were to take place, soon they were dated and published. C.—This will remain obscure till after the event. S. Jer.—What regarded the temple, happened in 300 years’ time. But it alludes also to antichrist. S. Greg. Mor. xxx. 12. W.  
**27** *Business*, at Susa. Nabuchodonosor had given him the province of Babylon.—*It.* All prophecies have a degree of obscurity before they be accomplished. Heb. may intimate that none could tell the cause of his anxiety. C.  
**Ver** **16** **.** *Between*, in an island formed by the river. It was the Son of God, ( C.) or S. Michael, (S. Jer.) directing Gabriel to explain the vision.

## Chapter 9

**1** *Darius*, the Mede. C. 5:31. If his reign had commenced at the same time with that of Cyrus, at Babylon, as it is commonly supposed, Daniel would have been under no anxiety respecting the people’s liberation, as it took place that year, ( C.) though perhaps not at the commencement. H.—Cyrus had now ruled over the Persians above two years, so that the first of Darius at Babylon agrees with the third of his reign over his countrymen. C. 10. C.—*Assuerus*, or Achasuerus, is not a proper name, but means “a great prince.” W.  
**2** *Jerusalem.* He read attentively the sacred volumes, particularly the prophecy of Jer. 25:11 and 29:10. Knowing that many predictions were conditional, he was afraid lest this might be so; notwithstanding a part of it seemed to be verified by the death of Baltassar. C.—Darius had reigned in Persia before. He only ruled part of a year, at Babylon, the 70th of the captivity. 2 Par. 36:22. Daniel perceiving that the time of the Jews’ deliverance was at hand, prayed with great zeal and confidence. W.  
**4** *Covenant.* God never breaks it first. C.—*Deus suâ gratiâ semel justificatos non deserit, nisi ab eis prius diseratur* *.* Trid. Sess. vi. 11.  
**9** *M* *ercy.* Thou art just, (v. 7) and sovereignly merciful. He speaks in the name of *all.* Some had continued faithful; but the number was comparatively inconsiderable. v. 11.  
**11** *Fallen*, by drops, (*sti* *llavit* *.* Deut. 27:13. &c. H.) like an inundation.  
**13** *Truth*, in executing thy promises and menaces.  
**16** *Against.* Heb. “according to.”—*Justice.* Sept. “mercy.” Let not the enemy boast that he has ruined thy temple, &c. v. 17. C.  
**21** *The man Gabriel.* The angel Gabriel in the shape of a man. Ch. C. 8:16.—*Sacrifice*, between the two vespers, (Num. 28:4) after the ninth hour, which was a time of prayer. Acts 3:1. C.  
**23** *Desires.* His zeal and mortification merit this title. W.—He was an object of God’s love. S. Jer. C. x. 11 and xi. 8. C.  
**24** *Seventy weeks* (viz. of years, or seventy times seven, that is, 490 years) *are shortened;* that is, fixed and determined, so that the time shall be no longer. Ch.—This is not a conditional prophecy. Daniel was solicitous to know when the seventy years of Jeremias would terminate. But something of far greater consequence is revealed to him, ( W.) even the coming and death of the Messias, four hundred and ninety years after the order for rebuilding the walls should be given, ( C.) at which period Christ would redeem the world, ( W.) and abolish the sacrifices of the law. C.—*Finished*, or arrive at its height by the crucifixion of the Son of God; (Theod.) or rather sin shall be forgiven. Heb. “to finish crimes to seal (*cover or remit*) sins, and to expiate iniquity.”—*Anointed.* Christ is the great anointed of God, the source of justice, and the end of the law and of the prophets, (Acts 10:38 and 1 Cor. 1:30. Rom. 10:4. C.) as well as the pardoner of crimes. These four characters belong only to Christ. W.  
**25** *Word*, &c. That is, from the twentieth year of king Artaxerxes, when, by his commandment, Nehemias rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem, 2 Esd. 2. From which time, according to the best chronology, there were just sixty-nine weeks of years, the is 483 years, to the baptism of Christ, when he first began to preach and execute the office of Messias. Ch.—The prophecy is divided into three periods: the first of forty-nine years, during which the walls were completed; (they had been raised in fifty-two days, (2 Esd. 6:15) but many other fortifications were still requisite) the second of four hundred and thirty-four years, at the end of which Christ was baptized, in the fifteenth of Tiberius, the third of three years and a half, during which Christ preached. In the middle of this last week, the ancient sacrifices became useless, ( C.) as the true Lamb of God had been immolated. Theod.—A *week* of years denotes seven years, as Lev. 25 and thus seventy of these weeks would make four hundred and ninety years. V. Bede. Rat. temp. 6 &c. W.—Origen would understand 4900 years, and dates from the fall of Adam to the ruin of the temple. Marsham begins twenty-one years after the captivity commenced, when Darius took Susa, and ends in the second of Judas, when the temple was purified. This system would destroy the prediction of Christ’s coming, and is very uncertain. Hardouin modifies it, and acknowledges that Christ was the end of the prophecy, though it was fulfilled in figure by the death of Onias III. See 1 Mac. 1:19. Senens. Bib. viii. hær. 12. and Estius. From C. 7 to 12 the changes in the East, till the time of Epiphanes, are variously described. After the angel had here addressed Daniel, the latter was still perplexed; (C. 10:1) and in order to remove his doubts, the angel informs him of the persecution of Epiphanes, as if he had been speaking of the same event. We may, therefore, count forty-nine years from the taking of Jerusalem (when Jeremias spoke, C. 6:19) to Cyrus, *the anointed*, (Is. 45:1) who was appointed to free God’s people. They would still be under the Persians, &c. for other four hundred and thirty-four years, and then Onias should be slain. Many would join the Machabees; the sacrifices should cease in the middle of the seventieth week, and the desolation shall continue to *the end* of it. Yet, though this system may seem plausible, it is better to stick to the common one, which naturally leads us to the death of Christ, dating from the tenth year of Artaxerxes. C.—He had reigned ten years already with his father. Petau.—All the East was persuaded that a great king should arise about the time; when our Saviour actually appeared, and fulfilled all that had been spoken of the Messias. C. Diss.—Ferguson says, “We have an astronomical demonstration of the truth of this ancient prophecy, seeing that the prophetic year of the Messias being cut off was the very same with the astronomical.” In a dispute between a Jew and a Christian, at Venice, the Rabbi who presided … put an end to the business by saying, “Let us shut up our Bibles; for if we proceed in the examination of this prophecy, it will make us all become Christians.” Watson, let. 6.—Hence probably the Jews denounce a curse on those who calculate the times, ( H.) and they have purposely curtailed their chronology. C.—*Times*, &c. (*angustia temporum*) which may allude both to the difficulties and opposition they met with in building, and to the shortness of the time in which they finished the wall, viz. fifty-two days. Ch.  
**26** *Weeks*, or four hundred and thirty-eight years, which elapsed from the twentieth of Artaxerxes to the death of Christ, according to the most exact chronologists. C.—*Slain.* Prot. “cut off, but not for himself, and the people of the prince that,” &c. H.—S. Jerom and some MSS. read, *C* *hristus, et non erit ejus* *.* The sense is thus suspended. The Jews lose their prerogative of being God’s people. C.—Christ will not receive them again. S. Jer.—Gr. “the unction shall be destroyed, and there shall not be judgment in him.” The priesthood and royal dignity is taken from the Jews. Theod.—The order of succession among the high priests was quite deranged, while the country was ruled by the Romans, and by Herod, a foreigner. C.—*Leader.* The Romans under Titus. Ch. C.  
**27** *Many.* Christ seems to allude to this passage. Mat. 26:28. He died for all; but several of the Jews particularly, would not receive the proffered grace. C.—*Of the week*, or in the middle of the week, &c. Because Christ preached three years and a half: and then, by his sacrifice upon the cross, abolished all the sacrifices of the law. Ch.—*Temple.* Heb. “the wing,” ( C.) or pinnacle, ( H.) the highest part of the temple. C.—*Desolation.* Some understand this of the profanation of the temple by the crimes of the Jews, and by the bloody faction of the zealots. Others, of the bringing in thither the ensigns and standard of the pagan Romans. Others, in fine, distinguish three different times of desolation: viz. that under Antiochus; that when the temple was destroyed by the Romans; and the last near the end of the world, under antichrist. To all which, as they suppose, this prophecy may have a relation. Ch.—Prot. “For the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even unto the consummation; and that determined, shall be poured upon the desolate.” H.—The ruin shall be entire. C.

## Chapter 10

**1** *Third.* This concurs with the first of Darius. Cyrus then reigned in Persia, and the king is here often mentioned, as the vision happened near it, on the banks of the Tigris. Only twenty-one days had elapsed since the former.—*Strength.* Heb. “warfare,” or determinate time. Job 7:1. This shall surely take place, but not soon. C.—*For.* Prot. “and had understanding,” &c. H.—He was informed of the meaning, or strove to know what the preceding vision denoted. C.—Pharao and Baltassar were not prophets, as they did not comprehend what they saw. For understanding is requisite, in order that a vision may be prophetical. S. Tho. ii. 2. q. 175 a. 2. W.  
**2** *Weeks.* Marsham says twenty-one years. But it means only so many days. He began to mourn on the third of Nisan, and continued fasting (v. 4) it seems even on the sabbaths, and on the feast of Passover, till the 24th. C.—He was grieved that the people did not make use of the leave granted by Cyrus; (Theod.) or because the Samaritans had prevailed at court to have the temple forbidden; (Usher, A. 3470, and 1 Esd. 1:1–4.) or rather because he could not fully understand the former visions. C. 9:3. and 12:9. &c. C.  
**5** *Line* *n.* Heb. baddim.—*Finest.* Heb. uphaz, ( H.) from Phasis or Ophir.  
**6** *Chrysolite.* Heb. “Tharsis.” This precious stone was perhaps greenish.  
**10** *Hand;* the Holy Ghost, or rather the angel Gabriel.  
**11** *Desires* most amiable. C.—This new title is given to comfort the prophet. W.  
**13** *The prince*, &c. That is, the angel guardian of Persia: who, according to his office, seeking the spiritual good of the Persians, was desirous that many of the Jews should remain among them. Ch.—S. Jerom, &c. explain it of the angel guardian. W.—Each country has an archangel over it, as individuals have an angel. Others assert that this was an evil angel; for how could a good one oppose so long the will of God? Yet this argument may be retorted, as evil spirits themselves must comply. It seems, therefore, that Cyrus was exhorted by the good angels to invade the Chaldeans, and thus to liberate God’s people. He was afraid of the hazardous attempt, and free-will may resist the inspirations of God.—*On* *e*, or “prince.” C.—Michael, and the guardian of Daniel, joined their prayers for the liberation of the Jews. v. 20. W.  
**14** *Days.* It will not soon take place; or, I have many things to tell.  
**20** *To thee?* He awakens his attention (v. 14. C.) and gratitude. H.—*Prince*, angel guardian; or Alexander, who would one day rout the Persians. C. 11:2. C.  
**21** *Of truth*, in the former sealed visions. C.—*Your prince.* The guardian general of the Church of God, ( Ch.) as he was of the synagogue. C.  

---

## Chapter 11

**1** *Confirmed.* Gabriel assisted Michael to comply with God’s orders. C. 10:21. C.—The angel continues his speech, and informs us that he had prayed for Darius after the fall of Babylon, seeing that he was well-inclined towards the Jews, as his successor Cyrus (who liberated them) was also. W.  
**2** *Three*, &c. Cambyses, Smerdis magus, and Darius the son of Hystaspes. Ch. W.—Cyrus had been mentioned before. C. 10:13. 20. Smerdis, or Artaxerxes, (1 Esd. 4:7) was the chief of the seven magi, and usurped the throne for six months after the death of Cambyses. C.—He had been declared king before ( H.) by Patizites, his own brother. The news excited the fury of Cambyses, who mounting on horseback gave himself a mortal wound in the thigh. Herod. iii. 21. See Ezec. 38:21. H.—*Fourth:* Xerxes. Ch.—He invaded Greece with an immense army, forcing those on the road to join him. Just. i. 10. Herod. vii. and viii. C.  
**3** *A strong king:* Alexander. Ch.—The sequel clearly points him out. Before fifteen years had elapsed, his mother, brother, and children were slain. Arideus, his brother, was declared regent till it should be seen what Rozanna should bring forth. After the death of those who might be heirs of Alexander, four general took the title of kings. Others governed in different places, but were destroyed by degrees.  
**4** *These* four; Ptolemy, Seleucus, Antigonus, and Antipater, kings of Egypt, Syria, Asia, and Greece. C. 7:6 and 8:22. Besides the other generals, ( C.) foreigners began to erect new kingdoms in what had formed the empire of Alexander. S. Jer. Livy xlv. C.  
**5** *South:* Ptolemeus, the son of Lagus, king of Egypt, which lies south of Jerusalem. Ch.—S. Irenæus (iv. 43.) observes, that all prophecies are obscure till they be fulfilled. History shews that this relates to Ptolemy. The kingdoms of Egypt and of Syria are more noticed, as they had much to do with the Jews. W.—Ptolemy took Cyprus ( C.) and Jerusalem. Jos. Ant. xii. 12.—*His princes* (that is, one of Alexander’s princes) *shall prevail over him;* that is, shall be stronger than the king of Egypt. He speaks of Seleucus Nicator, king of Asia and Syria, whose successors are here called the kings of the north, because their dominions lay to the north in respect to Jerusalem. Ch.—Nicator means a “conqueror.” H.—This king was master of all from Media and Babylonia to Jerusalem. Appian, &c. C.—Philadelphus was more powerful than his father. W.  
**6** *South.* Bernice, daughter of Ptolemeus Philadelphus, given in marriage to Antiochus Theos, grandson of Seleucus, ( Ch.) and king of Syria. She brought a great “dowry,” and was therefore styled Phernophoros. Antiochus agreed to repudiate Laodicea; but he soon took her back. Fearing his inconstancy, she poisoned him, and slew his son by Bernice. This lady in a rage mounted her chariot, and having knocked down the cruel minister of such barbarity, trampled upon his body. The rest pretended that the infant was still living, and delivered up a part of the palace to Bernice, yet slew her as soon as they had an opportunity. S. Jer. Usher, A. 3758. V. Max. ix. 10. &c. C.  
**7** *A plant*, &c. Ptolemeus Evergetes, the son of Philadelphus. Ch.—Three of Bernice’s maids of honour ( H.) covered her body, and pretended that she was only wounded, till her brother Evergetes came and seized almost all Asia, Callinicus not daring to give him battle. S. Jer. &c. Vaillant. A. 79. Lagid. C.—He laid waste Syria. W.  
**8** *Gods.* He took back what Cambyses had conveyed out of Egypt; and it was on this account that the people styled him “benefactor.” S. Jer. C.—*North.* Seleucus Callinicus. Ch.—If Evergetes had not been recalled into Egypt by civil broils, he would have seized all the kingdom of Seleucus. Just. xvii.—As he passed by Jerusalem (v. 9) he made great presents, and caused victims of thanksgiving to be offered up. Jos. c. Ap. ii.  
**10** *His sons.* Seleucus Ceraunius and Antiochus the great, the sons of Callinicus. Ch.—The former was poisoned after three years’ reign, as he marched against Attalus. Just. xxix.—Antiochus the great reconquered many provinces from Egypt, but was beaten at Raphia, on the confines, and lost Cœlo-syria. C.—*He shall*, &c. Antiochus the great. Ch.—He prosecuted the war, as his brother was prevented by death. W.  
**11** *South.* Ptolemeus Philopator, son of Evergetes. Ch.—He was an indolent prince; but his generals gained the victory. C.  
**12** *Prevail.* Many fell on both sides. H.—But Antiochus did not prevail; ( W.) or rather Philopator neglected the opportunity of dethroning his rival, ( C.) as he might have seized all his dominions, if he had not been too fond of ease. Just. xxx.—He followed the suggestions of his proud *heart*, when he attempted to enter the most holy place of the temple; and though he was visibly chastised by God, he would have vented his resentment on the Jews, if Providence had not miraculously protected them. 3 Mac. C. See Eccli. 50. H.  
**13** *Times*, seventeen years after the battle of Raphia. When Philopator was dead, and his son Epiphanes not above five years old, Antiochus and Philip of Macedon basely attempted to divide his dominions. Scopas engaged Antiochus, but lost the battle, and all that Philopator had recovered. C.—Many revolted in Egypt on account of the arrogance of Agathocles, who ruled in the king’s name. v. 14. S. Jer.  
**14** *Vision.* Many Jews, deceived by Onias, erected a temple in Egypt, falsely asserting that they fulfilled the prophecy of Isaias, 19:19. W.—This Onias was the son of Onias III. who was slain at Antioch. C. 9:25. H.—The temple of Onion was called after him. All allow that he transgressed the law, by offering sacrifice there after God had pitched upon Jerusalem. But this was done ( C.) under Philometor, forty-seven years (Usher) or longer after *those times*, when Epiphanes fought against Antiochus. The rebellion of the Jews against Egypt may therefore be meant. It was decreed that they should by under Antiochus, that his son might cause them to *fall*, ( C.) and punish them for their crimes. H.  
**15** *Cities;* Sidon, Gaza, and the citadel of Jerusalem, &c. C.  
**16** *Upon him.* Antiochus shall come upon the king of the south.—*Land:* Judea. Ch.—*Consumed*, or “perfected.” Antiochus was very favourable to the Jews; ( C.) invited all to return to Jerusalem, and furnished what was requisite for the sacrifices. Jos. Ant. xii. 3.  
**17** *Kingdom*, viz. all the kingdom of Ptolemeus Epiphanes, son of Philopator. Ch.—The Romans interrupted Antiochus, who resolved to lull the young prince asleep, till he had subdued these enemies. C.—*Of women.* That is, a most beautiful woman, viz. his daughter Cleopatra.—*It*, viz. the kingdom of Epiphanes; but his policy shall not succeed; for Cleopatra shall take more to heart the interest of her husband than that of her father. Ch.—He came with her to Raphia, and gave her Judea, &c. for her dowry, reserving half of the revenues. Heb. and Gr. have, “to corrupt her;” ( C.) Vulg. *eam* *;* as he wished his daughter to act perfidiously, that he might seize the whole kingdom. H.—Epiphanes and his generals were on their guard, and Cleopatra took part with her husband. S. Jer.  
**18** *Islands*, near Asia. He also went into Greece, and was master of that country when the Romans declared war against him. C.—*Of his reproach.* Scipio, the Roman general, called the prince of his reproach, because he overthrew Antiochus, and obliged him to submit to very dishonourable terms, before he would *cease* from the war. Ch.—Prot. “for a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease, without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.” H.—Being defeated at Magnesia, he chose the wisest plan of avoiding fresh reproach, by making peace, though ( C.) the terms were very hard. Livy xxxvii.—He jokingly observed, that he was obliged to the Romans for contracting his dominions. Cic. pro Dejot.  
**19** *Found.* Antiochus plundered the temple of the Elymaites to procure money; but they, (S. Jer.) or the neighbouring barbarous nations, rose up and slew him. Just. xxxii.  
**20** *One more vile.* Seleucus Philopator, who sent Heliodorus to plunder the temple; and was shortly after slain by the same Heliodorus. Ch.—He reigned about twelve years; and had sent his own son, Demetrius, to be a hostage at Rome instead of Epiphanes, whom he designed to place at the head of an army to invade Egypt. Heb. “one who shall cause the exactor to pass over the glory of the kingdom,” the temple. 2 Mac. 3. C.  
**21** *One despised;* viz. Antiochus Epiphanes, who at first was *despised* and not received for king. What is here said of this prince, is accommodated by S. Jerom and others to antichrist, of whom this Antiochus was a figure. Ch.—He lived and died basely; as the origin and end of antichrist will be ignominious. W.—All that follows, to the end of C. 12 regards Epiphanes. He had no title to the crown, which he procured by cunning, and held in the most shameful manner. He canvassed for the lowest offices, so that many styled him *Epimanes*, “the madman.” Diod. in Valesius, p. 305. C.  
**22** *Fighter.* That is, of them that shall oppose him, and shall fight against him. Ch.—Heliodorus, who had murdered his brother and usurped the throne, and Ptolemy Epiphanes, were discomfited. The latter was making preparations against Seleucus, and said that his riches were in the purses of his friends, upon which they poisoned him. S. Jer. C.—*Covenant*, or *of the league.* The chief of them that conspired against him; or the king of Egypt, his most powerful adversary. Ch.—This title belongs to antichrist, who will join the Jews, and be received as their Messias. S. Iren. v. 25. S. Jer. &c. Jo. 543. W.  
**23** *People.* Ephiphanes pretended to be tutor of Philometor. But the nobles of Egypt distrusted him; whereupon he came to a battle, near Pelusium, and the young king surrendered himself. His uncle thus took possession of Egypt with surprising facility. Yet the people of Alexandria crowned Evergetes, which occasioned a civil war. C.  
**24** *Places.* Theodot. reads, “Egypt,” omitting the *b*, ( H.) which gives a good sense.— C.  
**25** *The king.* Ptolemeus Philometor. Ch.—Epiphanes came under the pretext of restoring Philometor, and gained a victory over Evergetes; but returned in Syria, that the two brothers might weaken each other, ( C.) while the Syrians formed *designs* against both. H.  
**26** *Slain.* This was the perfidious policy of Epiphanes, who expected that the two brothers would destroy each other, so that he might easily seize Egypt, of which he kept the key, retaining the city of Pelusium. They were however reconciled, and reigned together. The Scripture often represents that as done which is only intended.  
**27** *Two kings:* Epiphanes and Philometor.—*Time.* Epiphanes, vexed that he should thus be duped, returned again into Egypt. v. 29.  
**28** *Riches*, taken in Egypt ( C.) and in Jerusalem. H.—The people had refused to receive Jason; and Epiphanes treated them in the most barbarous manner, profaned the temple, &c. 1 Mac. 1:23 and 2 Mac. 6:21. C.  
**30** *Galleys.* Heb. “ships of Chittim.” H.—The ambassadors probably came in vessels belonging to Macedonia, ( C.) which they found at Delos. Livy xliv.—*Romans.* Popilius and the other Roman ambassadors, who came in galleys, and obliged him to depart from Egypt. Ch.—He was only four or seven miles from Alexandria, and went to meet the ambassadors, who gave him the senate’s letter, ordering him to desist from the war. He said he would consult his friends: but Popilius formed a circle round him with his wand, requiring an answer before he went out of it. Hereupon the king withdrew his forces. Polyb. xcii. V. Max. vi. 4.—*Succeed.* Apollonius massacred many Jews on the sabbath. 1 Mac. 1:30.—*Against.* Heb. “respecting.” Prot. “have intelligence with them,” &c. H.—These wretches prompted him to make such edicts, for he was attached to no religion. 2 Mac. 4:9.  
**31** *Arms*, (*brac* *hia*) or strong men, Apollonius, Philip, &c. (2 Mac. 6) and likewise the senator from Antioch, who executed his decrees. C.—*Abomination.* The idol of Jupiter Olympius, which Antiochus ordered to be set up in the sanctuary of the temple, which is here called the *sanctuary of strength*, from the Almighty that was worshipped there. Ch.—Other idols were set up, and the people were compelled to sacrifice. C.—Yet even in the hottest persecutions some remained faithful. W.  
**32** *Dissemble.* Thus acted the officers and apostate Jews.—*Know.* Such were the Assideans, Eleazar, and the Machabees.  
**33** *L* *earned;* the priests, Matthathias, &c. Mal. 2:7.  
**34** *Help.* The victories of the Machabees were miraculous.—*Deceitfully*, like those who took the spoils of idols, and were slain. Heb. may imply, “secretly.” C.  
**35** *Fall*, or became martyrs. H.—Such were Eleazar, &c. C.—*Another time*, after death; ( H.) or the perfect deliverance shall take place later, v. 27.  
**36** *Every god.* “He plundered many ( C. *or* most; πλειστα. H.) temples.” Polyb. Athen. v. 6.—The Samaritans, and even the priests of the Lord, obeyed the impious decree; so that the king looked upon himself as a sort of god.—*Accompli* *shed* against the Jews, when Epiphanes shall be punished.  
**37** *God.* He laughed at religion, yet sometimes offered splendid presents and victims, which shewed his inconstancy. C.—*Women.* He kept many concubines, (Diod.) and committed the greatest obscenities publicly: *mimis et scortis* *.* S. Jer.—Heb. may have quite a different sense. He had no regard for the sex, ( C.) killing all indiscriminately. Grot.  
**38** *The god Maozim.* That is, the god of *forces* or *strong holds.* Ch.—Mahuzzim denotes “strong ones,” ( H.) *guardians*, &c. Dr. Newton (Diss.) explains, the *king* (v. 36) of the Roman state; and supposes that here the *guardian saints* and angels are meant, whose worship he shews “began in the Roman empire, very soon after it became Christian. This exposition seems far preferable to that which interprets” *Jupiter* or *the heavens*, and understands the idol set up by Epiphanes. See Univ. Hist. x. Parkhurst.—If these authors speak of the inferior veneration shewn to saints and angels in the Catholic Church, it had a much earlier commencement, being coeval with religion itself. But only the blindest prejudice can represent this as idolatrous, and of course this system must fall to the ground. H.—Others suppose that Mars, Hercules, *Azizus*, or Jupiter, may be designated. Heb. “He will rise up against all, (38) and against the strong God (*of Israel.* v. 31. C. 8:10. C.) he will, in his place, worship a strange god, “&c. Jun.—None of the ancestors of Epiphanes had ever adored Jupiter on the altar of holocausts. C.—He and antichrist adore either the great Jupiter or their own strength. W.  
**39** *To.* Heb. “in the most strong holds, with,” &c. H.—He built a fortress near the temple, styled Maoz, (Ezec. 24:25) on account of its strength. C.—*Glory.* He shall bestow honours, riches, and lands, upon them that shall worship his god. Ch.—He will entrust the strong places to them.  
**40** *Fight.* Epiphanes made war on Egypt, till the Romans forced him to desist. The prophet explains his preceding attempts, to which he only alluded. v. 29, 30.  
**41** *Land;* Egypt, or rather Judea. C.—Ammon*.* He will not divide his forces. S. Jer.  
**43** *Ethiopia.* Heb. “the Lubim and Cushim shall be at his steps.” Theodot. reads, “in their fortresses.” He had troops from these nations, or Egypt was guarded by them.  
**44** *North.* Judas continued victorious. Armenia ( C.) and Parthia rebelled. Tacit. v. 8.—*Many.* Epiphanes left three generals and half his army to destroy the Jews. C.  
**45** *Apadno* *.* Some take it for the proper name of a place; others, from the Heb. translate it, *his palace.* Ch.—He fixed his royal tent between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. W.—Porphyrius explains this of the march beyond the Euphrates, which S. Jerom does not disapprove. Apadno may denote Mesopotamia, which is styled Padan Aram.—*Glorious.* Heb. Zebi, C. or Tsebi, ( H.) may allude to Mount Taba, where the king perished, without *help.* 1 Mac. 6:11 and 2 Mac. 9:9. S. Jerom and many others explain all this of antichrist, and no doubt he was prefigured. The like events will probably take place again towards the end of the world. But as the particulars cannot be ascertained, we have adhered to the history of Antiochus. C.

## Chapter 12

**1** *Michael*, “who is like God,” alludes to the name of the Machabees; *Who is like unto thee among the gods?* The archangel protected the Jews, while Epiphanes was engaged beyond the Euphrates.—*Time.* The nation was in the utmost distress. Only about seven thousand ill-armed men adhered to Judas: yet these delivered the country by God’s decree.—*Book.* God seemed to keep a register of his friends. C.—Michael, the guardian of the Church, will protect her against antichrist, as her pastors will do visibly. W.  
**2** *Many.* This shews the great number. All shall rise again. In a figurative sense, the Jews who seemed buried shall appear and fight.—*To see.* Heb. “everlasting.” C.—S. Jerom has not seen a *d* ( H.) in the word. This text is express for eternal happiness or misery. C.—Some have understood, deraon, “stench,” or contempt, to denote the ignominy of the damned; but the prophet speaks of the times of the Machabees. Houbigant.—All shall rise in their bodies, but all shall not be changed for the better. 1 Cor. 15:51. W.  
**3** *Learned* in the law of God and true wisdom, which consists in knowing and loving God. Ch.—Heb. “instructors.”—*Instruct.* Heb. “justify,” in the same sense. The Machabees and other priests, &c. who instructed people in the law, and stood up for its defence, may be meant. C.—“There is as much difference between a learned sanctity and a holy rusticity, as there is between heaven and the stars.” S. Jer.—Teachers, martyrs, and virgins are entitled to an *aureola*, or accidental reward, besides the essential beatitude. W.—*Many.* Th. and the Vulg. read, “and of the just many *shall be* like for an age and after.” S. Jer.  
**4** *Shut.* The vision will not be understood till the event. C.—It is not to be interpreted by human wit, but by the spirit of God, wherewith the Church is enlightened and governed. S. Jer. in Gal. W.  
**5** *Two* angels of Persia and Greece, near the Tigris. Maldon.  
**6** *I.* Heb. “He.” Theod. Syr. and Arab. “they said” to Gabriel. C. 10:5. Angels ask questions of each other. C. 8:13.—*Wonders.* How long shall this be in the dark, and the misery continue?  
**7** *Heaven.* He thus shews that he is not God. C.—*Time* often implies a year. C. 4:13. Hence he means three years and a half. Christ assures us that those days shall be *shortened*, (Mat. 24:22) and the persecutor shall tarry a *short time.* Apoc. 17:10 and 12:14. The same period is insinuated by 1290 days, (v. 11) and 1330. v. 12. The two witnesses prophesy 1260 days, during which the Church shall be fed in the wilderness. (Apoc. 12:6.) But the term is most exactly specified by forty-two months. Apoc. 11:2 and 13:5. Hence all the Fathers agree that the last persecution shall continue no longer. W.—How absurdly do some Prot. explain this of *years* during which, they say, the papacy shall subsist! Whence will they date its origin? But they will readily trifle with the word of God, and admit any one to indulge his fancy, as long as he does not strike at the thirty-nine articles. If he do, he may expect that treatment of poor Stone, ( H.) whose death in the King’s Bench, aged 75, has been just announced. He pleaded that one article decided, “nothing was to be maintained which could not be proved by Scripture.” Yet he was deprived of his living by Dr. Porteus, who at one time was as eager to procure a change in the articles, yet was not prevented by his scruples from mounting the episcopal throne of Chester or of London. Stone had not this *discretion.* Rock. N. 306. He fell a victim to contradictory articles. He might be in error. But what right had Proteus to throw the first stone at him? or how will Protestants shew that any man is reprehensible for adopting the principles of the Reformation, which was entirely built on private interpretation? The applaud Luther, who established Scripture self-interpreted for the only rule, and they condemn Stone, Wesley, &c. for acting accordingly. If they have such *just weights and measures* for their own, what wonder then if the rights of Catholics be disregarded? H.—*Half a time.* The idol of Jupiter remained just three years. Yet the temple was not ready for sacrifices till other ten days had elapsed. They had been interrupted six months before that idol was set up. C.—We must date from the profanation and distress caused by Apllonius. 1 Mac. 4:52. Jos. S. Hypol. Usher, A. 3836. C.—*Band.* Lit. “hand.” H.—When the people shall be destitute of strength, God will miraculously deliver them.  
**8** *Understand not.* The prophets were obliged to pray, and sometimes to receive a fresh revelation to explain what they had seen. C. 9:2. 1 Pet. 1:11 and 1 Cor. 14:26. What regarded Antiochus and the Church was almost inexplicable before the event, as the times of antichrist are to us. v. 9.  
**10** *White*, by persecution endured with patience. C. 11:35.—*Learned.* While the weak Jews will be scandalized at this treatment, the virtuous will reflect that suffering is a trial of God’s servants, and a mark of predestination.  
**11** *Days:* thirteen more than three and a half, as we reckon. The odd number might be neglected. v. 7. The abomination continued three years and ten days, but the sacrifices had been discontinued six months and three days before. See C. 8:14. If Daniel speak of lunar years, as is probable, the difference would only be two days. C.—From the abolishing of the mass as much as possible, and the practice of heresy and *abomination*, unto the end of antichrist’s persecution, 1290 days shall elapse. W.  
**12** *Days.* After the three years and a half, fifty-eight days will occur before the death of Antiochus, when Judas will disperse the troops of his three generals. C.—Some respite will be granted for forty-five days, during which sinners may repent. M.—It is difficult to say why forty-five days are here added to the former number. We are content to depart with Daniel, (v. 9) without searching any farther into these high mysteries. W.  
**13** Lot*.* Thou shalt enjoy a glorious resurrection, ( M.) and thy dignities till death, for which thou must prepare. C.—*Days.* “Hitherto,” says S. Jerom, “we read Daniel, in the Heb. volume; what follows, to the end, is translated from Theodotion’s edition.” H.—The history of Susanna is there placed at the beginning. C.—According to the order of time, it should be placed after the first chapter. M.

## Chapter 13

**5** *Judges.* The Jews say they were Achab and Sedecias, (Orig.) as this text seems to allude to Jer. 29:21 or 33:14. But how were they burnt? since the Jews appear to have stoned them, unless they were delivered up to the king’s officers. v. 61. C.—The captives under Joakim, were better treated than those who were taken nineteen years afterwards, when all fell into a heavier bondage. W.—The might enjoy possessions, ( H.) and have judges of their nation. C.—Cappel. urges this difficulty, and many others, to shew that this account is fabulous. But as the Jews were allowed to follow their religion, the Chaldees would strive to keep them in good order. It is not said that Joakim was one of the captives. He might have settled long before at Babylon, where Helcias probably brought up his daughter in the fear of God. v. 3. The judges might also have had authority before over the Israelites, in Assyria, who were now all under the same government. v. 57. Houbigant. Pref.  
**7** *Noon*, at which time the Jews dined, (v. 13. Jos. vita) and the streets were as little frequented as they are at night among us. Hence the judges thought this a fit opportunity. C.  
**9** *Mind.* They were distracted by love, ( H.) and rendered foolish.  
**18** *Back door*, leading from the house. Strangers came by the other gates. C.—Susanna had not perhaps at first intended to bathe. Cappel. accuses her of imprudence, without reason. He cannot believe that the old judges would be so sottish as they appear to have been. Houbigant.  
**22** **V** **er.** **22** **.** *Death* of the soul, (S. Jer.) and also of the body, if the adultery were detected. How much does Susanna surpass the famed Lucretia, who slew herself to shew that she had not consented to her violation! *Si adultera cur laudata? Si pudica cur occisa?* S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. i. 19. S. Amb. de Sp. iii. 3. C.  
**24** *Out.* so the law ordained, when a woman was assaulted. H.  
**29** *People*, for greater shew of justice. W.—We here behold the forms.  
**32** *Uncovered*, pretending that respect for the company required it, or perhaps that they might detect her guilt by her blushes. C.—But their real motive is here disclosed. H.  
**34** *Head*, saying, “Thy malice brings on this chastisement, and not we.” Lyran.—They appear to discharge their conscience, (Lev. 1:4 and 24:14) no as judges but as accusers. The people pass sentence. v. 41. Adulteresses were stoned. Lev. 20:10. C.  
**41** *Death.* The multitude approved of this sentence, which the judges pronounced, pretending to act agreeably to the law. Deut. 22. W.  
**45** *Boy.* He was about twelve years old. S. Ign. ad Magn. Sulpit. ii. Theod.—He might walk out, though he lodged at court. Houbig.—God enabled him to declare that Susanna was innocent. The people had consented to her death, but he stands up in her defence. W.  
**46** *Clear.* This form is often used. Acts 18:6. Mat. 27:24.  
**48** *Truth.* They had taken no precautions to ascertain it; which they ought to have done the more, as Susanna had always been highly esteemed. C.—As the witnesses were positive, she must die, except their falsehood could be manifested, which not suspected. Houbig.  
**50** *Old men.* They speak sarcastically; or rather other senators, who had not been in the plot, address Daniel.  
**55** *Two.* This punishment was not unusual: yet it is probable that the two old men were stoned to death by the law of retaliation. v. 61. Ex. 19:4. There is an allusion, in Greek, between schinon and schisei, and also between Prinos and *prisei* *;* (v. 58, 59) and hence it is concluded that this work was originally in that language. But there might be a similar allusion in Heb. or Chal. or the translator might think it lawful to put one tree for another. C.—We find a tree called *shinar*, in Persia. Tavern. iv. 6. It would be easy to produce similar allusions in the Latin *ilex;* thus *ilico peribis*, &c. M.  
**57** *Israel*, when you were judges in Assyria. v. 5. H.—*Conversed.* No one could be alone with women, in the East, without suspicion.  
**61** *Neighbour;* stoning or strangling them, unless they gave them up to Nabuchodonosor’s officers. v. 5. C.  
**64** **4** **.** *Forward.* By this first prophetical act Daniel acquired fame, ( W.) which he retained till the death of Astyages. Maldon. M.  
**65** *Astyages*, or Darius. C. 5:31. This belongs to the following chapter ( C.) or to the 9th. W.—*Cyrus.* Little is known about his birth or death. Yet all agree that he conquered the Chaldeans. C.

## Chapter 14

**1** *Guest.* It seems most probable that the king here spoken of was Evilmerodac, the son and successor of Nabuchodonosor, and a great favourer of the Jews; ( Ch. W.) or it might be Darius, (Houbig.) or Cyrus, under whose reign S. Irenæus (iv. 11.) and others place this history. C.—The more correct Greek editions begin with the preceding verse. M.—Sept. read, “Prophecy of Abaum, son of Juda, of the tribe of Levi. There was a priest, Daniel, son of Abda, who was a guest of the king of Babylon,” &c. See Pref. H.  
**19** *Angry.* Cappel thinks the priests would not be so easily caught, or that such an imposture would not be so long concealed. But it was their interest to keep the secret, particularly if the king furnished the provisions; and in the night time they would not perceive the small ashes. Houbig.—The pagans stupidly believed ( C.) that the idols eat. Aristoph. Plutus. iii. 2.—All the objections against this history are refuted by Jer. 51:5. Houbigant.—It is wonderful that so learned a man as Cappel should urge so many. H.  
**22** *Dragon.* The devil had seduced our first parents in the form of a serpent, and caused most nations to adore it. C.—They expected benefit, or to be preserved from harm. Valer. i. 8. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. xiv. 11. W.  
**26** *Asunder*, being choked, and not poisoned. Vales. 81. M.—The throat is narrow. Solin. 43.  
**27** *Jew*, or “a Jew is king;” Daniel governs all. Grot.  
**28** *House.* Religion is daring. Darius was weak, and only a sort of viceroy, left by Cyrus. Houbig.  
**30** *The den of lions.* Daniel was twice cast into the den of lions: once under Darius, the Mede, because he had transgressed the king’s edict, by praying three times a day; and another time under Evilmerodac, by a sedition of the people. This time he remained six days in the lions’ den; the other time only one night. Ch.  
**31** *Carcasses:* people condemned, ( C.) or dead. Houbig.  
**32** *Habacuc* *.* The same, as some think, whose prophecy is found among the lesser prophets: but others believe him to be different. Ch.—About twenty years before there was no prophet in Judea. C. 3:38. Habacuc, the eighth of the minor prophets, lived before the Babylonian monarchy was formed. C. 1:6. W.—Yet he might still survive. If this had not been a true history, such an extraordinary mode of conveyance would not have been mentioned. Cappel imagines it was an allusion to Philip, the deacon, and fabricated by some Christian. But Theodotion found it in Heb. (Houbig.) and he was no friend to Christianity when he wrote; though he had once followed Tatian, and the Marcionites. H.  
**39** *Seventh.* He had not come before, supposing he was dead, till at last a rumour got to his ears, notwithstanding the precautions of the Babylonians, who hoped that Daniel would be starved to death. Houbigant, Proleg. p. 2. p. 425 which end here.  
**40** *Daniel.* Gr. adds, “besides thee there is no other.” H.  
**41** *Den*, by the law of retaliation. C. 6:24. M.  
**42** *Then*, &c. is not in Greek nor in the ancient MSS. of S. Jerom. The verse may be taken from C. 2:26. C.
