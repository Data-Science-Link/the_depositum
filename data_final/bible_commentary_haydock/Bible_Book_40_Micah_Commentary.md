# Micah Commentary

**Micheas,** of Morasti, a little town in the tribe of Juda, was cotemporary with the prophet Isaias, whom he resembles both in his spirit and his style. He is different from the prophet Micheas, mentioned in the Third Book of Kings, (C. 22) for that Micheas lived in the days of king Achab, one hundred and fifty years before the time of Ezechias, under whom this Micheas prophesied, ( Ch.) as he did in the two preceding reigns. H.—He addresses both Israel and Juda, and predicts the happiness of the Jews after the captivity, as a figure of what the church should enjoy. C.—The Jews shall embrace the faith at last, after the Gentiles. W.—We have only a small part of the predictions of Micheas, though he may have written no more. His style is obscure, like that of Osee. C.—His name signifies “humility,” or “who *is* like.” S. Jer.

## Chapter 1

**1** Morasthite, “of Maresa,” (Chal. C. 1:14. C.) a village near Eleutheropolis. S. Jer.—*Kings.* They reigned about sixty years. C.  
**2** *Witness.* Deut. 32. Is. 1 and 6. The prophet discharges his duty, and will not be blameable, if people die in their sins. Jer. 3:18. W.—This sublime address shews the importance of the subject, and how deep an impression the sins of Israel had made in his breast.  
**3** *Earth*, to subdue the rebels. Amos 4:13. Hab. 3:3. C.  
**4** *Melted.* Sept. “moved.” H.—*Cleft*, as it was to swallow up Core, (Num. 16:31) with the greatest ease.  
**5** *Jerusale* *m.* High places were left there under Joathan. 4 K. 15:35. Achab had introduced the worship of Baal into Samaria, and though the family of Jehu repressed this worship, it gained ground when Micheas appeared. C.—This conduct excited God’s indignation. H.—He came to punish the most guilty. C.  
**6** *Heap.* Sept. “hut to keep the fruit.” Heb. “hillock of the field,” ( H.) to be cultivated. Grot.—*Bare*, by Salmanasar. 4 K. 17:6. It was afterwards rebuilt, ( C.) but completely levelled by Hircan. Jos. Ant. xiii. 18.  
**7** *Her wages.* That is, her donaries or presents offered to her idols; or the hire of all her traffic and labour. Ch.—Samaria had trafficked with infidels, and thus grew rich, but imitated their idolatry; ( W.) and therefore was ruined, and her citizens and riches H. removed into Assyria. W.—*Harlot.* They were gathered together by one idolatrous city, viz. Samaria: and they shall be carried away to another idolatrous city, viz. Ninive. Ch.—The hire of prostitution was not to be received in God’s temple, (Deut. 23:18) which prohibition shews the antiquity of this abominable custom. Bar. 6:9. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. iv. 10. C.  
**8** *Naked.* Ill clothed, ( H.) to shew the approaching calamity of the Israelites. Is. 20. M.—Sept. and Chal. explain all of the people, ( C.) or of Samaria. “Therefore shall she lament and howl, go barefoot and naked, bewail like,” &c. H.—*Dragons*, when they are crushed by the elephant. Solin xxxviii. M.—Tannim means also ( H.) whales, &c. which make a horrible noise.—*Ostriches*, or swans. Is. 13:21. Both have a mournful note. C.  
**9** *Gate.* That is, the destruction of Samaria shall be followed by the invasion of my people of Juda, and the Assyrian shall come and lay all waste even to the confines of Jerusalem. Ch.—Juda received the worship of Baal from Israel. It shared in the punishment of that kingdom. The prophet alludes to the ravages of Sennacherib, v. 13. Yet Juda was much afflicted by Razin and Phacee, before that invasion: which caused Achaz to call in the aid of Theglathphalassar. 2 Par. 28 and 4 K. 16. C.  
**10** *Geth* *.* Amongst the Philistines, lest they rejoice at your calamity. Ch. 2 K. 1:20. Amos 3:9. C.—Tell not these calamities, which I foresee, among your enemies, lest they rejoice. But lament in your own houses, which shall be filled with dust. S. Jerom prays for the light of the Holy Ghost to understand this passage. W.—*Weep ye not.* Keep in your tears, that you may not give your enemies an occasion of exulting over you: but in your own houses, or in your *house of dust*, your *earthly habitation, sprinkle yourselve* *s with dust*, and put on the habit of penitents. Some take the house of *dust* (in Hebrew Haphra) to be the proper name of a city. Ch.—*With tears.* Heb. “at all,” (Prot. H.) “in Acco,” or Ptolemais, (Reland) or Bochim, ( H.) a place near Jerusalem. Judg. 2:1. But no reference to this place, or to “the Enakim,” (who appear in some copies of the Sept.) seems to be made.—*Of dust.* Samaria. v. 6. C.  
**11** *Place.* In Samaria. In the Hebrew, the *beautiful place* is expressed by the word Shaphir, which some take for the proper name of a city. Ch.—It is thought that S. Jerom has given the sense of several proper names, ( C.) or this has been done since in the Vulg. by some other. In the edit. of his works, (A.D. 1533) we read, “The dwelling of Saphir passes from you: she hath not come out who inhabits Sennan. The house of Asel shall receive,” &c. H.—Saphir or Diocesarea was a strong place (Jos. Bel. ii. 37.) of Galilee, where Saanan was also situated. Judg. 4:11. Haetsel may denote “the vicinity.” C.—People shall not attempt to comfort their neighbours, being themselves under the greatest alarms. H.—*Forth.* That is, they that dwelt in the confines came not forth, but kept themselves within, for fear.—*Adjoining*, viz. Judea and Jerusalem, neighbours to Samaria, and partners in her sins, shall share also in her *mourning* and calamity: though they had pretended to *stand by themselves*, trusting in their strength. Ch.—All the inhabitants shall be led into captivity naked. H.  
**12** *Weak*, &c. Jerusalem is become weak unto any good; because she dwells in the bitterness of sin. Ch.—Prot. “the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good.” H.—We know not of any place called Maroth. Grotius would substitute Ramoth. C.—*Bitterness.* S. Jer. “Maroth.” Sym. “provoking to bitterness.” They are unable to defend their possessions. H.  
**13** *Lachis*, when Sennacherib came to besiege it. 4 K. 18:13. C.—*Beginning.* That is, Lachis was the first city of Juda that learnt from Samaria the worship of idols, and communicated it to Jerusalem. Ch.—This is not very probable. We may translate, “this is the source of sin,” or of chastisement; or the imitation of Israel, is the chief of the crimes of Sion. C.  
**14** *Send.* Lachis shall send to Geth for help; but in vain: for Geth, instead of helping, shall be found to be a *house of lying* and *deceit* to Israel. Ch.—*Inheritance.* Some translate rather “Moreseth (or Morasthi) of Geth, the houses of Acsib,” &c. Both these towns were near Geth, and perhaps at this time subject to it. 2 Par. 28:18. Achaz sent to ask for aid against the king of Israel, v. 9. C.—Prot. “therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-Gath, the houses of Achzib *shall be* a lie to the,” &c. H.—There is an allusion between *Acsib* and a *lie*, as also between *Maresa* and an *heir*, (v. 15. C.) as the terms have those senses. H.  
**15** *Heir. Maresa* (which was the name of a city of Juda) signifies *inheritance:* but here God by his prophet tells the Jews, that he will bring them *an heir* to take possession of their *inheritance:* and that *the glory of Israel* shall be obliged to give place, and to retire even to *Odollam*, a city in the extremity of their dominions. And therefore he exhorts them to penance in the following verse. Ch.—Maresa shall fall a prey to the king of Assyria. Micheas was a native of this town, and he ironically addresses his countrymen. C.—*Glory.* Thus he denotes “the misery” of Israel, which shall be extended to the last town in Juda. W.—Heb. means also “burden.” Odolla was taken by Sennacherib, ( C.) with the other towns around Jerusalem. H.  
**16** *Eagle.* When it loses its feathers, it becomes languid. Theod.—This verse should be joined with the next chapter, which regards the kingdom of Israel. C.

## Chapter 2

**1** *Evil.* Sept. “labours.” Heb. “vanity, *or* an idol.” H.—That is called unprofitable, which is very detrimental. W.—*Morning*, suddenly and with zeal. C.—*Is.* Heb. “has power,” (Chal.) “they have not raised their hands to God.” Sept. Arab.  
**2** *Oppressed.* Lit. “calumniated,” ( H.) as Jezabel did Naboth. 3 K. 21:13.  
**3** *Time.* It was very near. Micheas saw the ruin of Samaria, under Theglathphalassar and Salmanasar.  
**4** *Say.* The Israelites sing this mournful canticle to v. 7 which the prophet composes for them, to shew the certainty of the event. It is very difficult. C.—The whole synagogue speaks. M.—*Depart.* How do you pretend to say that the Assyrian is departing, when indeed he is coming to divide our lands amongst his subjects? Ch.—The Cutheans were sent into the country. 4 K. 17:24. C.—Sept. “and there was none to hinder him from returning, our lands were divided.” H.  
**5** *None.* Thou shalt have no longer any lot or inheritance in the land of the people of the Lord. Ch.—Strangers had taken possession. C.—Virgil has the like affecting thoughts. Ec. 1. *Impius hæc tam culta novalia miles habebit?* H.  
**6** *Drop.* That is, the prophecy shall not come upon these. Such were the sentiments of the people that were unwilling to believe the threats of the prophets. Ch.—The princes order the prophets not to inculcate so many miseries. W.—Heb. “Make it not rain: they will make it rain: they will cause no rain like this: confusion shall not cease.” The people beg that the prophets would not announce such judgments: but, ( C.) correcting themselves, they bid them to say what they please, ( H.) as nothing can befall them more terrible. Here the canticle ends. C.—Sept. “shed no tears, nor let them weep for these things, for she will not cast away reproaches, who says the house of Jacob has provoked the spirit,” &c. H.  
**7** *Straitened.* Is he inclined to danger? The prophet replies, if God punishes, it is because the people will not repent. C.—His mercy is extended to penitents, as well as to the just. W.  
**8** *Away.* You have often stripped people of their necessary garments; and have treated such as were innocently passing on the way, as if they were at war with you. Ch.—He alludes to Israel attacking Juda without cause, and killing 120,000 at once, while they took 200,000 women and children (v. 9) captives, whom Oded indeed persuaded them to release. 2 Par. 28:6. Sept. are very obscure in this chapter. C.  
**9** *Cast out*, &c. Either by depriving them of their houses; or, by your crimes, giving occasion to their being carried away captives, and their children, by that means, never learning to praise the Lord. Ch.—The Jews accustomed them to sing God’s praises early, while they were still innocent. Ps. 8:2. Misery might cause them to complain of Providence. Perhaps the prophet alludes to the custom of divorces. Mal. 2:15.  
**10** *Corruption.* Your sins will not permit you to remain any longer, and strangers shall defile this land. C.  
**11** *Would God*, &c. The prophet could have wished, out of his love to his people, that he might be deceived in denouncing to them these evils that were to fall upon them: but by conforming himself to the will of God, he declares to them that he is sent to prophesy, literally to *let drop* upon them, the wine of God’s indignation, with which they should be made drunk; that is, stupified and cast down. Ch.—Prot. “If a man, walking in the spirit of falsehood, do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and strong drink, he shall even be a prophet of this people.” But I cannot thus deceive you. H.  
**12** *Assemble.* God shews his mercy, in gathering his Church out of all nations. W.—At least the Jews shall be converted, (Rom. 11:25. S. Jer. Eus. Dem. ii. 50.) or they shall be butchered by the Assyrians. Sanct.—*Men.* The country was very populous when the Romans destroyed the Jews. They had returned by degrees. C.  
**13** *Open.* Heb. “break down.” H.—*Divide.* Heb. “make a breach.” They shall return boldly, and in triumph. C.

## Chapter 3

**1** *I.* Heb. and Sept. “He, *the Lord*, said;” *or*, Micheas addressed the princes of both kingdoms, under Ezechias. v. 12. Jer. 26:18.—*To know* and practice. Osee 6:3. C.—Both rich and poor strove to extort from each other. W.  
**2** *Skins.* When some exhorted Tiberius to lay on more taxes, he replied: “a good shepherd must shear the flock, and not tear off the skin.” Suet. xxxii.  
**5** *Peace.* They pretend goodness, while they do the greatest mischief.—*Prepare.* Lit. “sanctify,” ( H.) or denounce war. C.—False prophets seek their private lucre. W.  
**6** *Vision.* Impostors shall skulk through fear, when the people shall see that they were not sent. v. 7.  
**8** *Spirit.* I am no impostor. C. 2:11.  
**10** *Iniquity.* You offer victims unjustly procured, or build your palaces with what belongs to the poor.  
**11** *Hire.* It is not lawful to refuse instruction to those who have nothing; nor must priests act solely for a temporal reward, though reason shews that they should be supported by those whom they have to teach. Mat. 10:8, 10. Gal. 6:6 and 1 Tim. 5:18. C.—The *judges* grew rich by other people’s quarrels; and, as all ranks offended, they were justly involved in ruin. v. 12. W.  
**12** *Forests*, after its destruction by Nabuchodonosor. C.—In the space of three years’ neglect, shrubs were growing in the courts of the temple. 1 Mac. 4:38. H.—Rufus ploughed up the spot where the temple had stood, after the Romans had burnt it down. S. Jer. Jos. Bel. vii. 20.—This prediction made a deep impression on the minds of the people. It caused them to refrain from killing Jeremias. v. 1. C.  

---

## Chapter 4

**1** *Last days.* This sometimes means after this. Is. 9:1. But here it denotes the time which shall elapse from Christ till the day of eternity. The Jews allow that this prediction regards the Messias, though they will not explain it of Jesus Christ. Their exceptions are well refuted by Ribera. W.—It is plain that it can be verified nowhere else, but in the Church of Christ; though some expressions may, as usual, refer to the return of the captives. Isaias, (2:2.) &c. had already used the like terms under Ozias. Juda is here comforted, after its ruin had been denounced.  
**2** *Jer* *usalem.* No other nation ever embraced the Jewish law. But all received the gospel, ( C.) which was first preached at, Jerusalem, by people of that country. H.—“We are of yesterday, and we fill all your places.” Tert.  
**3** *Judge*, or “rule” (Judg. 8:22) as Christ does over all. C.—*Plough-shares.* Heb. “scythes,” ( H.) or “coulters.” W. Mart. xiv. 34. C.—*Learn*, &c. The law of Christ is a law of peace; and all his true subjects, as much as lies in them, love and keep peace with all the world. Ch.—They will sustain injuries meekly. 1 Cor. 6. W.—When Christ appeared, the Roman empire enjoyed peace. C.—*Aspera tum positis mitescent sæcula bellis*, &c. Æn. i.  
**4** *Fig-tree.* Such a happiness would not suit the ambitious. Zac. 3:10.  
**5** *And ever.* After the captivity the Gentiles continued to worship idols, and the Jews had a greater aversion for them; but when the gospel was propagated, idols fell into contempt, and the Jewish law was at an end, while heretics were varying continually. The Church alone is stable, and built upon the rock. C.—All such quiet people as walk in the name of the Lord, will keep peace even with those who hate it, (Ps. 119) suffering persecution with joy. Heb. 10:34. S. Iræn. iv. 67. S. Cyr. &c. W.  
**6** *Halteth*, as the synagogue did, (3 K. 18:21) bringing nothing to perfection, (Heb. 7:19) while the Gentiles were abandoned to idolatry. From both Christ chose his Church. Acts 21:20. &c. C.—The Jews will be at last converted. W.  
**7** *Remnant*, or numerous progeny.—*Afflicted.* Heb. and Sept. “repudiated,” ( C.) or “cast off.” H.  
**8** *Cloudy.* Hebrew.” fortress, *or ophel*,” a tower or wall near the temple. 2 Esd. 3:27.—*Flock.* Jerusalem was no better, after the Chaldeans had destroyed it. 4 K. 17:9. Yet there Zorobabel, the Machabees, and Christ displayed their power. It was the cradle of the Church. Some take this to refer to Bethlehem, as C. 5:2. C.—*Shall it come.* Sept. add, “from Babylon.” After the captivity the Jews shall flourish, as the Church shall prove victorious over all her persecutors. H.  
**9** *No king*, after Sedecias was taken. C.—The two tribes shall be led into captivity and released. v. 12. W.  
**11** *Sion.* Let us enter the sanctuary and plunder it. Cambyses was instigated to fall upon the Jews lately returned. Ezec. 38:11. His rapacious designs were frustrated, as those of persecutors will be. C.  
**12** *Hay.* Prot. “sheaves.” H.—People were thus often trodden to death by oxen. Athen. xii. 5.  
**13** *Brass.* Fear nothing. The Jews did not attack the army of Cambyses, (Ezec. 38:21 and 39:10. C.) at least at first. H.—But what God did for them is attributed to them. C.—*Immolate* *.* Sept. “devote to the Lord their multitude, and,” &c. Prot. “gain,” ( H.) or what spoils they have taken. C.

## Chapter 5

**1** *Robber.* Some understand this of Babylon, which *robbed* and pillaged the temple of God; others understand it of Jerusalem, by reason of the many rapines and oppressions committed there. Ch.—Heb. “now assemble, O daughter of troops;” Babylon, famous H. for soldiers, who will seize Sedecias; (Jer. 39:6. C.) or Jerusalem, noted for rapine. C. 3. Thou shalt be spoiled, yet restored till Bethlehem bring forth Christ, the ruler of the world. W.  
**2** Ephrata*.* This was the ancient name ( H.) of Bethlehem, (Gen. 35:16) though some think that it was so called after Caleb’s wife. 1 Par. 2:19.—*Art*, or “art thou?” &c. which makes it agree with Mat. 2:4.—*Little.* Heb. tsahir, ( H.) is often rendered “considerable.” Chal.—*Thousands:* capital cities. Zac. 9:7. Bethlehem seemed too mean to send forth a ruler over the rest. The ancient Jews clearly understood this of the Messias. The moderns explain it of Zorobabel: but the expressions are too grand for him. C.—S. Jerom accuses the Jews of having designedly omitted some cities, (Jos. 15:60) because Bethlehem Ephrata is one. It is nowhere else thus described. Kennicott.—The priests substituted *land of Juda* instead of Ephrata*.* Mat. 2. H.—The evangelist recites their words, to shew their negligence in quoting Scripture. “Yet some assert, that in almost all quotations from the Old Test. the order or words are changed, and sometimes the sense, … as the apostles did not write out of a book, but trusted to memory, which is sometimes fallacious.” S. Jer.—This principle would he very dangerous, (Simon. Crit. i. 17.) and we should attribute the variation to other causes, as the sacred penman could not mistake. H.—Bethlehem, though a little town, was rendered more illustrious than many others by the birth of Christ. W.—*Forth.* That is, he who *as man* shall be born in thee, *as God* was born of his Father from all eternity. Ch.—His coming was also long before announced. Orig. c. Cels. i.—But the former sense is preferable. C.—*Eternity*. These expressions singly imply a long time; (Ex. 21:6. Ps. 13:7) but when doubled, *sæculum sæculi*, &c. they must be understood of an absolute eternity, which Christ enjoyed with the Father and the Holy Ghost; though, in his human nature, he was born in time. W.  
**3** *Forth*, till Babylon let them go; (Sanct.) or the Jews shall enjoy the land till Christ come; (S. Jer. exp. ii.) or he will leave them in their blindness till the nations shall have received the gospel, when there shall be *one fold.* Jo. 10:16. Rom. 9:25.  
**4** *Earth*, Christ shall be glorified, governing his Church. The Jews shall be respected as a people singularly favoured.  
**5** *Peace.* This regards Christ and not Zorobabel. C.—*Assyrian.* That is, the persecutors of the Church; who are here called Assyrians by the prophet, because the Assyrians were at that time the chief enemies and persecutors of the people of God. Ch.—The Persians held the empire which had belonged to Babylon and to Assyria, and was founded by Nemrod. Gen. 10:8. C.—*Seven*, &c. The pastors of God’s Church, and the defenders of the faith. The number *seven*, in Scripture; is taken to signify many; and when *eight* is joined with it, we are to understand that the number will be very great. Ch.—See Eccle. 11:2. Ruth 4:16. C.—Christ always preserves a great number, not withstanding the attacks of persecutors enabling bishops to feed them with a power which the people must revere. Heb. 13. W.—*Eight.* Eschylus places Artaphanes between Smerdis and Hystaspes, the former of whom was one of the seven magi, and the latter one of the seven conspirators, ( C.) or rather chief princes, who attacked the usurper. H.—They always retained great privileges, so that they seemed all to govern. V. Max. ix. 2. Herod. iii. 65. See 1 Esd. 4:7. Est. 1:14 where we find that the kings did nothing of importance without their seven counsellors. C.—*Principal.* Sept. “bites (Sym. Christ’s) of men,” or people of the old as well as of the new law. S. Jer.  
**6** *They* *.* Hystaspes first laid a tax of money on the Persians, who hence styled him a merchant. Herod. iii. 89.—He was severe, and often at war. C.—*Feed.* They shall make spiritual conquests in the lands of their persecutors, with the *sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.* Eph. 6:17. Ch.—*With*, &c. Sept. “in the ditch.” Th. &c. “gates,” where sentence was given.—*Borders.* Seven or eight princes have taken the place of Cambyses, who had invaded Judea. v. 5. C.  
**7** *Jacob;* viz. the apostles, and the first preachers of the Jewish nation, whose doctrine, like dew, shall make the plants of the converted Gentiles grow up, without waiting for any man to cultivate them by human learning. Ch.—Under Hystaspes, the husband of Esther, the Jews enjoyed rest, and Providence protected them. C.  
**8** *Lio* *n.* This denotes the fortitude of these first preachers, and their success in their spiritual enterprises. Ch.—The Jews, by leave of Assuerus, defended themselves; and the Machabees became terrible. Est. 9 and 1 Mac. 3:4. The power of the latter was established, while the efforts of Eupator and of other Syrian persecutors for sixty years, down to Zebina, proved fruitless or destructive to themselves. C.  
**10** *Horses.* Some understand this, and all that follows to the end of the chapter, as addressed to the enemies of the Church. But it may as well be understood of the converts to the Church, who should no longer put their trust in any of these things. Ch.—God will protect his people, so that horses and fortifications will be unnecessary.  
**11** *Sorceries.* The Jews after their return abstained more from such things; but not like the Church of Christ, in which idols and dealings with the devil have never been tolerated.  
**14** *Ear*, to the admonitions of the prophets. Hence Egypt, &c. were justly punished.

## Chapter 6

**1** *The mountains*, &c. That is, the princes, the great ones of the people. Ch.—But Heb. intimates real mountains, which had witnessed the impiety of the people, ( C.) and had been defiled with their altars, &c. Prot. “Contend thou before the,” &c. ( H.) as God’s advocate. He condescends to justify his conduct towards Israel. Is. 3:13. C.—He had shewn them great favours, but they were ungrateful. Off. for good Frid. W.  
**4** *Slaves.* Their prison, in Algiers, &c. is dreadful. C.—*Mary.* She taught the women. Chal. Theod.—She was a figure of Christ’s mother, as Moses and Aaron were of himself. W.  
**5** *From Setim to Galgal.* He puts them in mind of the favour he did them, in not suffering them to be quite destroyed by the evil purpose of Balach and the wicked counsel of Balaam; and then gives them a hint of the wonders he wrought in order to bring them into the land of promise, by stopping the course of the Jordan, in their march from Setim to Galgal. Ch.—Galgala, “limits,” may denote those of the Jordan, between which river and Setim Israel was encamped. Num. 22 and 25.—*Justices.* Sym. “mercies.” C.  
**6** *What shall I offer*, &c. This is spoken in the person of the people, desiring to be informed what they are to do to please God. Ch.—They can answer nothing in their own defence.  
**7** *Fat.* Heb. “torrents of oil.”—*First-born*, like Jephte, or the king of Moab. Jud. 11 and 4 K. 3:27. Saturn taught the Phœnicians this impiety. Eus. præp. iv. 16. C.  
**8** *Solicitous.* Heb. also, “humbly.” H.—This was preferable to all other sacrifices of the old law, ( W.) and was frequently inculcated. Deut. 10:12. Ps. 49:9. Is. 1:11. Yet the carnal Jews always made perfection consist in exterior ceremonies.  
**14** *And thy.* Sept. “I will cast thee away into thyself.” H.—*Hold* of some fruit. C.—Thy wife shall miscarry; (Vat. &c.) or if she bring forth, the children shall perish by the *sword.*  
**16** *The statutes of Amri*, &c. The wicked ways of Amri and Achab, idolatrous kings. Ch.—They were the most infamous of Israel. 3 K. 16:25. 30. W.—Heb. “the statutes of Amri are kept.” Sept. “The precepts (ámi) of my people shall parish” H.—*You*, rich men. C.—Sept. “you shall receive the reproach of people.” H.

## Chapter 7

**1** *Figs*, which are the worst. S. Jer. S. Amb. in Lu. vii. 3. Yet they were eagerly sought after, before the other figs came to maturity. They had escaped the rigours of winter. Such Christ ( C.) seemed to expect. Mark 11:13.  
**2** *Holy man.* Heb. chasid, ( H.) “the pious” Assidean. 2 Mac. 14:6. The disorder of Israel was great, though some were religious. C.—Such expressions only mean that few could be found, and that the far greatest number rejected the prophet’s advice. W.  
**3** *Giving.* Sept. “speaks words of peace.” He flatters the prince, ( H.) and dares not oppose the unjust. Syr. “he says, bring presents.”—*Troubled it;* or, “have thy?” &c. Heb. “they confirm it.”  
**4** *Brier.* Heb. chedek, or “thorn.” Sept. “a consuming moth.”—*Inspection*, or of thy chiefs ( H.) and prophets. C.  
**5** *Bosom.* In times of general distress, even domestics are not trusted; because all are solicitous for themselves, even to the prejudice of others. W.—Before the ruin of Israel civil wars raged. 4 K. 15. Our Saviour alludes to this passage. Mat. 10:35. Lu. 12:52 and 21:16. People will rise up to oppress true believers; and these must abandon their nearest relations, when they prove an obstacle to salvation. Thus is the moral, and the other the literal sense. C.  
**10** *She;* Babylon, my enemy. Ch.—It was taken by the Medes and Persians, who set the Jews at liberty, to the great mortification of their enemies.
