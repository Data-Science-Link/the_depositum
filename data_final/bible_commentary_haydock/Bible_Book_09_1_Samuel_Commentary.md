# 1 Samuel Commentary

**This** and the following Book are called by the Hebrews, the Books of Samuel, because they contain the history of Samuel, and of the two kings, Saul and David, whom he anointed. They are more commonly named by the Fathers, the First and Second Book of Kings. As to the writer of them, it is the common opinion that Samuel composed the first book, as far as the twenty-fifth chapter; and that the prophets Nathan and Gad finished the first and wrote the second book. See 1 Par. alias 1 Chronicles, 29:19. Ch.—The authors of the Third and Fourth Books of Kings were also prophets, but we know not exactly their names. These works have nevertheless been always esteemed authentic ( H.) and canonical. W.—V. Bede takes occasion to observe, from the Books of Kings (or as the Sept. read, “of kingdoms;” H.) being placed after that of Judges, that the everlasting kingdom of Christ will succeed the general judgment. The translation of the priesthood and of the regal dignity, recorded in these books, denote also that Christ would united both in his own person; as the two wives of Eleana intimated, that both Jews and Gentiles would acknowledge the same Lord. S. Jerom, S. Aug. &c.—The transactions of Heli, Samuel and Saul, and the persecutions which David sustained from the latter, form the subject of the first book, ( H.) during the space of 100 years. All the four books carry down the sacred history near 600 years, from A. 2849 till the transmigration of Juda, A. 3420. C. Usher.

## Chapter 1

**1** *There.* Heb. Sept. &c. “And there,” &c. The books of Scripture are thus frequently connected. The authors present us with a series of events, without prefixing any title, or their own names, that our attention may be wholly fixed on what we read. The birth of Samuel being so miraculous, deserves to be recorded, as he was the last judge of Israel, and had so much to do under the first of their kings, whose election and misconduct brought a great change into the state of the commonwealth. C.—*Ramathaimsophim.* Rama, or Ramatha, “a height,” and the environs were occupied by the family of Suph, a descendant of Core; (1 Par. 6:29) though the place did not properly belong to the Levites. It lay probably between Gabaa and Bethel, where Samuel spent much of his time, while he was judge, and obliged to be frequently absent from the tabernacle. C.—Ragusinus and Prince Radzivil think it was afterwards called Arimathea, the birth-place of Joseph, and now Ramula. T. C. 2:11.—*Ephraimi* *te.* He was of the tribe of Levi, (1 Par. 6:34) but is called an Ephraimites from dwelling in Mount Ephraim. Ch.—So we read of Cretan Jews. Acts 2:11. T.  
**2** *Phenenna* *.* She was only of inferior dignity. At that time polygamy was lawful, ( M.) as Moses insinuates, if he do not expressly allow it.  
**3** *Days*, the three great festivals. His family accompanied him, though the law only lays an express injunction upon the males to attend. We find, however, that females did not neglect to come. C.—*Hosts.* Heb. (Tsebaoth) of “armies,” both of angels and of Israel. God is attended by myriads of angels, and decides the fate of armies. H.—This title has not appeared in the former books. The pagans took occasion from it to form their *Jupiter Sabazius.* C.—Elcana might go up from the height of Ramatha to Silo, which was the highest mountain round Jerusalem of all in the holy land. Adrichom. T.  
**4** *Sacrificed*, by the hand of the priests, ( M.) who had the breast and right shoulder; the rest was given back to the person who had presented the fattened victim, that he might feast with his friends. C.  
**5** *With sorrow.* Hebrew apayim, “of faces, indignation, ( C.) sorrow;” ( M.) or that was presented before him. Chal. and many others translate, “a chosen:” ( C.) Prot. “a worthy portion.” H.—The shew-bread is called, “the bread of the face,” because it stood before the Lord. Joseph sent to each of his brethren, “a portion of his faces,” as the Heb. expresses it; (Gen. 43:33) or of such meat as was placed upon his table. In the East, the master of a family has all set before him, and he sends to each his portion, to the place where he is sitting. Chardin, Perse.—Thus Elcana sent some more excellent, or “double,” part to his beloved Anna, ( C.) grieving inwardly that she had no children, to whom he might also send. H.—By this distinction, he wished to alleviate the sorrow of his wife. M.—*Womb.* Sterility was deemed a curse, and a mark of God’s displeasure, with which women were often reproached. Hence Anna prays so earnestly that God would be mindful of her. v. 11–19. The power of the Almighty, in giving children to the barren, is frequently mentioned. Gen. 28:13. Ps. 112:9. C.—Luke 1:25. &c. H.  
**6** Insomuch*.* Heb. “to make her fret, *or* rage; because the Lord,” &c. C.  
**7** *Lord.* Then they could hardly avoid being together on the road, and Anna was accustomed to pray earnestly ( M.) to be delivered from her reproach. H.  
**9** *Silo;* either in some private house, or in the porch before the tabernacle. She complied with the entreaty of her husband. M.—*Stool.* Heb. “Heli was sitting upon a throne, near the steps, leading to the palace of the Lord.” It is also called the temple, or the house of God, though it was only a tent. Mat. 12:4. &c. Perhaps women were not allowed to go beyond the porch.  
**11** *A vow;* rightly trusting that her husband would give his consent. Num. 30:7.—*Razor.* Heb. mora, “scissors.” Sept. “iron.” Some copies add, “he shall not drink wine, nor any intoxicating drink.” In quality of Levite, Samuel was bound to serve the tabernacle from 25 or 30 years of age till he was 50. Num. 4:2. Anna consecrates him to the Lord for life, and promises that he shall be a Nazarite, like Samson, and S. John Baptist. The law prescribes no rules for these perpetual Nazarites. Num. 6:3. Many of the ancients believe that Samuel always observed the prescriptions of Moses, and abstained from intoxicating liquors; though the Heb. and Vulg. are silent on this head. We find that during his administration as Judge, he was not able to continue always near the tabernacle. C.—When he came to years of discretion, he might depart if he thought proper, like other Levites. Had he been of another tribe, he must have been redeemed. W.—Esther, Elcana, or Samuel, might have annulled this vow. Salien, A. 2900.  
**12** *Prayers*, out of fervour; not through vain superstition and ostentation, as the Pharisees and pagans did. Mat. 23:14. Christ does not condemn many, or long prayers, since he prayed whole nights for our instruction. Luc. 21:38. and 6:12. 1 Thes. 5:17.—*Mouth.* He tried, but could not hear what she said. C.  
**14** *Much.* Heli’s “son or servant,” (παιδαριον, according to the Sept.) addressed these words to Anna. Her going to pray immediately after a feast, instead of taking recreation, increased the suspicion. S. Chrys. hom. 1.—Salien (A.C. 1153) observes the many instances of patience which Anna exhibits on this occasion. H.—She teaches us not to answer the unjust reproaches of our superiors with haughtiness. D.  
**15** *My lord.* She gives him this title, though he had called her a drunken woman. H.—*Unhappy.* Heb. “of a hard (or afflicted) spirit.” See Cant. 8:6. C.  
**16** Belial*;* “without restraint;” abandoned. H.—Sept. “pestiferous.”—*Sorrow.* Heb. “meditation;” ( C.) what preys upon my spirits. H.  
**17** *Peace*, with all blessings. M.  
**18** *Eyes:* that thou wouldst lay aside thy suspicions against my character, and pray ( C.) that I may obtain so great a happiness.—*Changed.* Heb. “no more,” as it had been sad, and defaced with tears. H.—She was now full of hope and joy. M.—Sept. “her countenance fell not.” She was not moved with anger or with jealousy. Gen. 4:6. C.  
**20** *About*, at the expiration of the year, which term the ancients frequently allowed between the conception and the nativity. Gen. 18:10.—*Samuel.* This name imports, *asked of God.* Ch.—Some letters are omitted for the easier pronunciation, as the Hebrews would now write it, Saul-meel; ( C.) or it may signigy, “God placed him,” *sum-hal.* T.—*Shaal* means, “to ask.” But Vatable thinks that Anna retained only the first letter. M.  
**21** *Vow*, in consequence of his son’s nativity. The sacrifice might be of precept, such as the paschal lamb, or for his wife’s purification and the redemption of his first-born, as they could not attend in person. C.—Heb. “the victim of days and his vow,” which he had probably made in conjunction with Anna. M.  
**22** *Wean* *ed.* The mother of the Machabees weaned her children when they were three years old; (2 Mac. 7:27) which Gallien asserts as the proper time, though Avicenna fixes upon two years. See Gen. 21:8. Iremellius translates, “till the child be grown up.” But we must not allow any long term, since he was *very young* when he was presented to the Lord. v. 24.  
**23** *Word*, by preserving the life of the child, ( C.) and enabling him to serve according to our engagement. H.—*Word* is often put for “a thing,” in Heb. May God perfect his own work. M.  
**24** *Three calves.* Sept. “a calf three years old,” such as Abraham sacrificed, Gen. 15:9. We only find one offered up, v. 25.—*Bushels.* Heb. epha, ( C.) each of which contained three bushes or measures. Ruth 2:17. H.—*Bottle.* Heb. nebel, a large measure containing above 87 pints. C.—The sacrifices seem to have been for thanksgiving, accompanied with an ephi for each calf, and with wine. Num. 15. Ezec. 46:7.  
**26** *Liveth:* a strong attestation. M.—As sure as you live; or, may you enjoy a long and happy life. See C. 17:55. and 20:3. Dan. 3:9. 2 Esd. 2:3.  
**28** *Lent.* This is equivalent to giving entirely. Anna presents her son to the Lord, to serve in his tabernacle as long as God shall think proper. He dispensed with his personal attendance, when he appointed him judge. C. 7:15. C.—As much as depended on Samuel’s mother, he was consecrated for ever. But he was at liberty to ratify the vow if he pleased. M.—The expression, *lent*, seems to reserve the dominion of the thing, which Anna had entirely given up, so that we might translate the Heb. “Therefore I have him *simply* as one lent … he is a thing lent, which belongs to the Lord.” C.—*They.* Heb. “he worshipped the Lord there.” Grabe found not these words in the Alex. copy, which by comparison of this chapter with the the Vatican edition, appears, to be more accurate. Both omit this sentence: but it is found in the Aldine edition of the Sept. Proleg. C. 4. The Targum adds, “and she prayed in the spirit of prophecy, and said.” H.

## Chapter 2

**1** *Rejoiced.* Sept. and Chal. “been strengthened.” Anna composed this canticle at the nativity of her son; or rather at his presentation in the tabernacle. She foretells the reign and glory of the Messias, and of his church. S. Aug. de C. xvii. 4.—*Horn.* The *horn* in the Scripture signifies strength, power, and glory: so the horn is said to be exalted, when a person receives an increase of strength or glory. Ch.—So Horace (3 Ode, 21.) says, *addis cornua pauperi* *.*—*Enlarged.* Chal. “I have opened my mouth, to speak great things against my enemies.” She has Phenenna principally in view, and compares her present glory with her former distress. C.—I may boast more on account of Samuel, than my rival can of her numerous offspring. M.  
**2** *Holy.* This is frequently a title of God, the holy one of Israel. Isai. 1:4 and 5:19. He is essentially holy.—*Strong.* Heb. “no rock like,” &c. The rocks of Palestine were the common fortresses of the nation, having caverns to which the people fled for refuge. Hence God is often called a rock, ( C.) as non can afford such protection. H. Ps. 17:2. Deut. 32:15.  
**3** *Old.* Heb. hathak means also, “hard things.” D.—“Let arrogance come out of your mouth,” to return no more. Yet most people supply the negation from the former member; “Let *not* arrogance *or* hard things.” Chal. “blasphemy,” &c. C.—Cease to praise idols, as you have done. W.—Use not the malevolent language to which you have been accustomed.—*Knowledge.* The secrets of hearts are open to him.—*And to him.* Heb. “and by him actions are weighed,” as in scales; ( H.) or, “thoughts (and actions) are not established.” Sym. The Syr. and Arab. also read the negation, “there are not pretexts before him;” or, “are not actions founded upon him?” Will he not execute what he has wisely designed, in spite of opposition? H.—Sept. “and God prepares his thought;” C. (επιτηδευματα αυτου) or, “what is convenient for him.” H.—They have read lu, “of him,” instead of la, “not,” as they are authorized to do by the Keri, (or various readings in the margin) and by several Heb. MSS. The Prot. think rightly, and suppose that la, “not,” has been omitted, “Let *not* arrogancy;” because we find it in Chal. Sept. Syr. and Arab. versions. Lu is substituted for la, v. 16. When some have been pressed with the argument of variations, called Keri, they have said that they were rather explanations of obscure words in the text: but is there any obscurity in lu, “to him,” and la, “not;” or can they explain each other? Leusden answers in the affirmative, v. 16! Kennicott.  
**4** *Overcome.* Heb. “broken.” Sept. “he has weakened the bow,” having deprived it of its elasticity.  
**5** *Many.* Heb. “seven,” which is often used in the same sense. Anna had never more than six children; ( C.) whereas Phenenna had perhaps ten. C. 1:8. and 3:21. H.—The Rabbins pretend that she lost one every time that Anna brought forth. But the text says nothing of the kind. It only insinuates at most, that she had no more. This admirably represents the state of the Synagogue, compared to the Christian Church. S. Aug. sup. C. W.—The blessed Virgin conveys the same idea in other words. Luke 1. M.  
**6** *Hell*, (*infernos*,) “the lower regions.” God calls us out of this world, or restores the dead to life, as he thinks proper. H.—He easily makes the greatest prosperity succeed extreme distress, which is often denoted by death, hell, &c. So Seneca says, *Mortis habet vices—Lentis cum trahitur vita gemitibus* *.* The prodigal son is said to have come to life again, when his father received him, contrary to his expectations. Luke 15:24. Ps. 29:4. &c. C.  
**7** *Exalteth.* The same instances of God’s power and providence are related, Ps. 112:7. Luke 1:52. M.—Hesiod (op.) says, “Jupiter easily gives or takes away power,” &c.  
**8** *World.* The Hebrews represented the earth as resting on a firm basis, or on pillars, or turning on poles. Ps. 103:5. Prov. 8:25. &c. The magistrates of the earth may be also thus designated, as the world is entrusted to their care. God compares Jeremias to an iron pillar. Jer. 1:18. Apoc. 3:12. C.—The last sentence is omitted in the Sept.  
**9** *Saints.* Heb. “kind, merciful, pious ones;” ( C.) those to whom he shews mercy, and who comply with his will in assisting others. Sept. “Granting their petition to those who ask him, and he has blessed the years of the just, because man is not strong by *his own* strength.” H.—*Silent:* condemned to death. *Mox etiam Lemures animas dixere silentes* *.* Ovid, Fast. v. *Loca nocte silentia late* *.* Virg. vi. Unable to act as they had done, and ashamed of themselves, ( C.) they seek for the most obscure retreat, where they may not behold the glory of those whom they have despised. They will pray that the hills would fall upon them, and hide them from the indignation of the Lamb. H.  
**10** *Him.* Sept. “The Lord will render his adversary weak. The holy Lord. Let not the prudent boast of his prudence,” &c. ( H. which seems to be added from Jer. 9:23. C.) “The Lord has mounted the heavens, and thundered. He judges the ends of the earth, and gives power to those who rule, as kings, over us,” &c. H.—*Heavens.* This prediction against the Philistines was exactly verified. C. 7:10. It denotes the protection which God grants to his servants. Ps. 17:8, 14.—*Christ.* Chaldee, and the best interpreters, understand this of the Messias: “He will multiply the kingdom of his Messias.” Jonathan.—Anna might also have David in view, who was one of his most express figures. C.—But neither he, nor Solomon, ever ruled over all the earth, as Christ will. Ps. 2:8. W.—Zachary seems to allude to this text. Luke 1:69. C.—The empire of Christ rose from the smallest beginnings. M.  
**11** *Ramatha.* Heb. *Rama.* Sept. Alex. “and they left him there before the Lord, and went away to Armathaim.” H.  
**12** *The Lord*, whom they denied by their works. Tit. 1:16.  
**13** *Nor the office.* The Vulg. repeats the negation from the preceding sentence. Others translate, “The priests’ custom with the people *was*,” &c. or, “the *pretended* right of the priests,” &c. They neither performed their duty towards God, ( C.) nor were they content with what the law authorized them to receive from the people. H.—*Servant*, or son; perhaps Ophni or Phinees.—*Boiling.* In the heroic times, the meat was never boiled, but roasted. Athen. i. 10. and Servius; though Hesiod asserts the contrary, v. 748. C.—Abulensis (q. 8.) observes that the person who offered the victim, boiled the parts which belonged to himself, as well as the priest’s share. But, whereas in the peace-offerings, only the breast and the right shoulder fell to the priest, these rapacious men took whatever they pleased. M.  
**14** *Pan.* Heb. has also four terms, but their precise meaning cannot be determined. The vessels were of different forms, or intended for various uses.  
**15** *Raw.* Here are two other abuses. The fat ought first to have been burnt, in honour of the Lord; and the meat should have been boiled, in order that the priest might not be taken off from his sacred functions; as custom, it seems, had determined, though the law be silent on this head.  
**16** Desireth. The Laic gives an example of moderation and zeal, to which the priest might well have paid some deference. The former is willing to abandon his goods, provided the honour of God be not neglected. H.  
**17** *Lord.* People, seeing that the law was not observed, refrained from presenting victims. M.—They are but too apt to follow the bad example of their teachers. H.—Hence God punishes the smallest faults of his ministers, with great severity, since they withdraw people from his service, by their scandalous behaviour, and are guilty of a more horrid sacrilege than those who laid violent hands on the Lord of majesty. S. Bern. ser. i. Nothing brings a greater discredit on religion. C.  
**18** *Ephod.* It was not, therefore, peculiar to priests, 2 K. 6:14.  
**19** *Coat.* Heb. mehil, the outer garment. Hence it appears that the parents of the people consecrated to the Lord, furnished them with clothes, till they were able to serve the tabernacle, otherwise they would have been a burden to it. C.  
**20** *Lent.* This was in reply to what Anna had said. C. 1:28. H.—God always gives back with interest. M.  
**21** *Lord.* He behaved well in the tabernacle, ( C.) notwithstanding the ill example of Heli’s own sons. H.  
**22** *Waited*, like an army of guards. Ex. 37:8. The Rabbins pretend that these priests only sent away these women who came to be purified, and allowed them to return to their husbands before the appointed time, and thus caused the latter to offend. These authors are generally very fertile in discoveries. C.—The virgins or widows gave themselves up to work for the tabernacle. M.—The sons of Heli found an opportunity in the sacred practices of religion to gratify their passions. Perhaps some false pastors in the Church of Christ may have imitated their perversity. A man of the character of Mr. Crowley, a late deserter of the Catholic faith, judging of others by the corruption of his own heart, would hence insinuate that they all take these liberties, or at least that it is “a miracle,” if they can admit females to confession, without yielding to such base temptations. If this be a miracle, we may confidently hope that wonders have not ceased, otherwise among his other malicious remarks, he would surely have adduced some proofs of his assertion, from the records of past ages. But in reality he seems to be little acquainted (though he pretends to have been converted by it, &c. and falsely asserts it is kept from laymen) either with history or with the Bible, having read perhaps little more than what his Catechism set before him; and this he boldly contradicts, as if he supposed that this “Thoughts” would have more weight than the decisions of the Fathers and of the whole Church. If he can find a professor of Maynooth, and another or two Irish priests, disposed to follow his example, (which we need not believe on his assertion) what would this prove? Yet Mr. Slack lays great stress on this man’s authority, in his late defence of Wesley. Letters to R. Campion, Esq. Whitby, 1811. So ready are the enemies of the Catholic faith to scrape together every idle remark that may tend to defame the mother Church! So eager are infidels to reject the faith, on account of the misconduct of some of its degenerate professors! H.—The best of fathers have often very profligate children, as the latter take pride in the honours of their family, and expect to obtain the same without trouble. Grot.  
**23** *People.* They could not refrain from complaining of the iniquity of his children, how much soever they might revere him. Though he was not a witness himself of their abominations, such an uproar must have convinced him that they were guilty. H.—The Fathers in general blame the lenity of the high priest, who ought not only to have rebuked, but also to have put a stop to the crying sins of his sons, by the utmost severity. C.  
**25** *Who shall pray for him.* By these words Heli would have his sons understand, that by their wicked abuse of sacred things, and of the very sacrifices which were appointed to appease the Lord, they deprived themselves of the ordinary means of reconciliation with God; which was by sacrifices. The more, because as they were the *chief priests*, whose business it was to intercede for all others, they had no other to offer sacrifice and make atonement for them. Ch.—We need not, however, consider the words of Heli as an oracle of God. Sanchez.—In human transactions, a person would find more difficulty in obtaining pardon, when the judge himself had received the injury. Sept. instead of *appeased*, have “and they shall pray for him.” M.—Some may be found to plead his cause, but if he offend the judge, who will undertake to be his advocate? What medicines shall be used, when those, which God has appointed, are trodden under foot? H.—By persevering in such wickedness, no redress can be expected: and indeed, the infinite distance between God and man, would place an insuperable obstacle to a reconciliation, if Jesus Christ had not undertaken the cause even of the most desperate sinner. C.—*Because the Lord would slay them.* In consequence of their manifold sacrileges, he would not soften their hearts with his efficacious grace, but was determined to destroy them. Ch.—They had filled up the measure of their crimes; and, though God wills not the death of a sinner, they had treasured up to themselves wrath, which he will now display. We might also translate *ci*, “therefore,” (Noldius. Ose. 9:15, &c.) or “that.” They would not be convinced that the threat of their father would be executed. Schmid. C.—Sins directly against God, and which hinder his service, are remitted with greater difficulty, though to all true penitents pardon is promised. Ezec. 33. God did not take away the free will of Ophni and Phinees, but left them to their own obstinacy, and justly punished them. See S. Aug. c. Jul. v. 3. W.—They had already rendered themselves unworthy of extraordinary graces. T. S. Tho. 1 p. q. 23, n. 3.  
**26** *And men.* Thus he is, in some degree, compared with our Saviour. Luke 2:52. When one minister prevaricates, God presently raises up another, so that he never abandons his Church. H.  
**27** *A man.* His name is unknown. Some say it was Elcana, Samuel or an angel, &c. The Rabbins suppose that Phinees performed this office. But he was long ago dead, ( C.) or he would still have enjoyed the high priesthood instead of Heli.—*Father’* *s.* Aaron was the chief both of the house of Eleazar and of Ithamar, and was selected by God to be his ambassador and priest. H.—His posterity held the high priesthood till after the reign of Herod.  
**28** *Ephod*, and all the pontifical attire. H.—The high priest wore a different sort of ephod from that of other people. C.—*All the*, &c. Even of the holocausts, the priests received the skin. M.  
**29** **V** **er.** **29** **.** *Away*, by scandalizing the people, and causing them to neglect offering the appointed victims. H.—*To eat.* Heli seems to have refrained from divesting his sons of their high office, that the riches of his family might not be impaired. C.—Avarice is the root of many evils, and those who seek to become rich fall into many snares. Poverty soon overtook the descendants of Heli, while the immediate perpetrators of the wickedness were punished with death. H.  
**30** *Ever.* God had promised the priesthood to Aaron’s seed ( C.) as long as the Jewish religion should subsist. H.—He had also selected the branch of Eleazar, to recompense the zeal of Phinees; (Num. 25:13,) and yet we find that the house of Ithamar had possession for a time of the high priesthood. We know not when or by what means by obtained it. The promises of God to them were surely only conditional; and some think that they only meant, that as He had permitted them to acquire this high dignity, so it was an earnest that he would not deprive them of it, unless they proved unworthy. But it is generally supposed that God had expressed his determination of this head. Heli, Achitob, Achias, Achimelech, and Abiathar, ( C.) were the only pontiffs of the family of Ithamar. The last was obliged to resign to ( H.) Sadoc, under the reign of Solomon, 3 K. 2:27. Some suppose that Heli usurped this dignity, (Capel) when he entered upon the civil administration, as the people thought none more fit for the office, in a time of trouble. Bertram.—Others think that the descendants of Eleazar forfeited this honour by their crimes or indolence, or because they were not of sufficient age. But this reason would not have excluded them for ever. The Scripture, therefore, insinuates that Heli was appointed by God, and that his descendants would have enjoyed his office, if they had not offended. C.—These promises were of a conditional nature both to Phinees and to Heli, and Sadoc, v. 35. See Num. 25. &c. H.—God never changes. M.  
**31** **Ver** **.** **31** **.** *Arm*, strength or children. I will slay some; others I will reduce to extreme want. Some explain it of the ark, which was the protection of Israel. C.—*Old man*, to govern. D.—It is often a title of dignity. But the four succeeding pontiffs did not live long. In the course of little more than 100 years, the last was deposed. C.  
**32** *Thy rival.* A priest of another race. This was partly filled when Abiathar, of the race of Heli, was removed from the priesthood, and *Sadoc*, who was of another line, was substituted in his place. But it was more fully accomplished in the New Testament, when the priesthood of Aaron gave place to that of Christ. Ch.—Some suppose that this rival was Samuel, in whom this prediction was partly fulfilled, though more completely in Christ. Bede, q. M.—Heli saw not in person the exaltation of Eleazar’s family. Heb. and other version are very much embarrassed here. C.—Prot. “and thou shalt see an enemy *in my* habitation, in all *the wealth* which *God* shall give Israel.” H.  
**33** *Spent.* Hence we may learn to adore the depth of God’s judgments, who knows how to punish both in life and death.—*Part.* Sept. “the most exalted of thy house shall fall by the sword of men.”  
**35** *Faithful* often denotes what shall continue a long time. Isai. 33:16 and 55:3. C.—But in the conduct of Sadoc, we find nothing reprehensible. M.—This faithful priest pointed out the Christian priesthood, as the sequel shews. C.—*All days.* He shall perform his office. H.—*Anointed*, king Solomon. M.—The priests of the new law ought always to have Christ in view. C.  
**36** *Bread;* like the poorest sort of people. M.—Being degraded, they shall ask the other priests to offer sacrifice for them. Heb. “shall bend before him for a piece of silver, and for a morsel of bread.” He shall humbly intreat to be employed as a priest, in order to get a livelihood.—The *piece of silver.* Heb. agorath, probably denotes the gerah, the smallest coin, or what was given for a day’s wages. Agor means to hire, in Chal. Syr. &c. Hence the Greek, αγοραζω, “I purchase.”—*Office.* The priests served in their turns; (1 Par. 24) so that the descendants of Heli must have been entitled to a subsistence. But whether God punished them, by requiring that they should ask the high priest for this, as for a favour, or this was required of all the inferior priests before they could be employed, or whether, in fine, the descendants of Abiathar were reduced to the condition of Levites, or wholly degraded, we know not. See 4 K. 23:9. Ezec. 44:10. C.—They may petition for a part of the victims which fell to the share of the priests, ( M.) and might be eaten by any that was not defiled. H.

## Chapter 3

**1** *Before.* Chal. “in the days of Heli.” The young Levite slept in an adjoining chamber, to wait on the high priest, not far from the sanctuary.—*Precious;* that is, rare: ( Ch). as such things are generally more esteemed, ( H.) which are granted to few. W.—Some prophets had appeared under the former judges: but they were not so common as they were from the days of Samuel, till a little after the captivity. S. Peter ranks Samuel in the first place. Act. 3:24. C.—*Vision.* No prophet was publicly recognized, to whom the people might have recourse. M.  
**3** *Out*, towards morning, ( C. Ex. 27:20) when some of the lamps were to be extinguished. W.—*Samuel slept.* Some would transpose these words to the end of the verse, as they think it improbable that Samuel should be in the place where the high priest himself could enter only once a year. Vatab. &c.—But this change seems harsh and unnecessary, as Heli and Samuel might be in apartments contiguous to the holy place. Sanctius. M. C.—During the night none of the priests would be in the sanctuary, so that Heli might form a judgment that not of them had called Samuel. T.  
**7** *Him.* He had not before an experimental knowledge of the manner in which God revealed his will to men. C.  
**9** *Heareth;* ready to comply with whatever may be required. H.  
**10** *Times*, (*secundo* *:*) a second time, or repeatedly, or mentioning the name twice, ( M.) as God does sometimes in urgent cases. Gen. 22:11. H.  
**11** *Tingle*, through astonishment and fright. Jer. 19:3. 4 K. 21:12.  
**12** *House*, by the prophet. C. 2:27.  
**13** *Wickedly.* Sept. “were cursing God.” This is one of the places which the Jews have corrected. D.—*Judge;* or condemn and punish. Prov. 19:29. C.—*Chastise them*, not in words only, or in a soft manner, as he had done. Heb. “because his sons made themselves despicable, and he did not frown upon them.” H.—*Ciha* denotes, to correct with a wrinkled face. M.—Aquila, “he did not look black at them,” nor avert his eyes with horror. All this iniquity was done publicly, and in his presence; ( C.) and he suffered his children to proceed without any restraint. It is not sufficient to reprove, when a father can correct. H.  
**14** **Ve** **r.** **14** **.** *Sworn.* We read not of an express oath; ( C.) but the denunciation of God was equivalent. H.—*Iniquity*, or punishment. Nothing could withhold the indignation of the Lord, in correcting the sinner, though he would shew mercy eternally to the penitent. But he saw the obstinacy of these priests, and their unhappy end. The sacrifices of the old law always presupposed suitable internal sentiments, to grant the remission of sin; and even for the avoiding of the legal punishments, they must have been offered in a true spirit of religion, which these abandoned wretches despised and neglected. C.—God threatens that he will punish their crimes for ever, as he abominates the contempt of priest. T.  
**15** *Slept.* Heb. and Sept. “laid himself down to sleep.” For how could he take any rest after such terrible threats? ( C.) particularly as light was beginning to appear, when he was called by God, v. 3.—*Doors.* Some walls had probably been built, to enclose the curtains of the tabernacle. A priest would have been employed to open the sanctuary. C.  
**17** *And so.* Lit. “May God do these things to thee, and add these also.” It is not certain that he mentioned the particular punishment, ( H.) though it is most probable. The Scripture refrains from repeating them. Grot.—Ruth 1:17. C.  
**18** *Sight.* Some of the Fathers think that these words proceeded from an habitual indifference, as he was not disposed to molest his sons any farther, let the consequences be what they might. S. Greg. S. Ephrem, &c.—But others believe, that Heli was actuated by the spirit of humanity and resignation, and saved his soul. C. See C. 4:18.—*Years.* The author of the Concord. between the Books of Kings and of Chronicles, thinks Samuel was then 39. D.  
**19** *Ground*, unfulfilled. This may be understood of the words of the Lord, ( C.) which Samuel had announced. His other predictions were constantly verified, so that he was justly regarded as a true prophet. H.  
**20** *Faithful.* Hebrew Neeman, may be a title of dignity, or may signify that Samuel was confirmed and continued to be a prophet. C.—*According to*, or by. God revealed his will to him by *word*, and not by visions. Sanchez.—*Israel.* The whole people suffered along with their leaders. H.—They were concerned in the prediction which was denounced against the house of Heli. M.—Sept. “and Samuel was entrusted to the prophet of the Lord, to all Israel, from the ends of the earth to the ends: And Heli was very old, and his sons going went forward, and their way was wicked before the Lord.” Thus they usher in the following catastrophe. H.

## Chapter 4

**1** *And.* Heb. inserts here the conclusion of the last verse, whence some would infer that Samuel told the Israelites to make war upon the Philistines. But as it turned out so ill, this would have tended to discredit him; and we find that the Philistines were the aggressors.—*Days.* this war took place immediately after the threats denounced to Heli; (Sararius) or according to Usher, and the best chronologists, about 27 years after that event. C.—The addition of the Sept. seems to insinuate, that the sons of Heli persevered for a long time in their wicked course. C. 3:20. H.—Josephus says that Phinees was his father’s coadjutor.—Salien observes that this must be considered as a fresh blot in the character of the latter, since he ought to have delivered the delinquents up to execution. Deut. 21:21. Tirin, on the contrary, adduces the power of his sons, and the debilitated state of Heli, to excuse his neglect. H.—*Help.* In Heb. Eben-ezer; so called, from the *help* which the Lord was pleased afterwards to give to his people, Israel, in that place, by the prayers of Samuel, C. 7:12. ( Ch.) about 21 years afterwards.—*Aphec*, in the tribe of Juda, not far from Maspha.  
**2** *Here*, &c. Heb. “in the field” of battle. C.—Sept. “in the ranks, in the field.” H.  
**3** *Ancients;* the commanders of the respective tribes. Heli was not able to lead on the people to battle, on account of his blindness and great age.—*Enemies.* All nations attribute much to the exterior marks of religion. The Israelites had witnessed the victories which had been obtained while the ark was present. Jos. 6:4. See Num. 14:45. But they ought to have considered, that their infidelity rendered them unworthy of the divine protection; and that God was more displeased at their profanations, than at the indignity to which the sacred vessels would be exposed. He would know how to vindicate his own honour and glory. The symbols of religion were thus carried in the army, by the Persians, &c. Herod. vii.—The Romans regarded their standards as so many deities. Halicar. vi. See 2 K. 6:21. 2 Par. 13:8. C.—The confidence which the Israelites placed in the ark was commendable, but their sins deserved to be punished. W. Num. 10:35.  
**4** *Ark.* On this extraordinary emergency they thought it lawful. Abulensis, q. 6.—They easily obtained the consent of Heli; and his sons went to take it down, and to attend it to the army, as he was incapable of doing duty. We know not what ceremonies were used, nor whether the brothers acted as high priests alternately. C.—*Cherubim.* The Scripture often represents God in this manner. Ex. 25:22. Ps. 17:10. Ezec. 10:1. The commonality of the Jews attributed bodies to the angels, but to denote that they were not like those with which we are acquainted, they called them cherubim, or complex and unusual figures. C.  
**7** *God:* “Elohim.” Sept. “these gods.” They speak of the true God according to their false ideas. C.—*Sighing.* Sept. “deliver us, O Lord, this day.”  
**8** **Ve** **r.** **8** **.** *Joy.* A few days ago the Hebrews were dismayed, now they shout for joy, as they did at the taking of Jericho. Heb. and Sept. “it was not so heretofore.” H.—*Gods.* Heb. may be rendered in the singular, with the Chal. and Arab. But the Sept. and most commentators, explain it in the sense of the Vulg. The title of high, (adirim) or magnificent, was given by the Philistines to Dagon, whom they styled Atergatis. C.—Sept. στερεων, means, “stable, perfect,” &c. H.—*Plagues*, till they were overwhelmed in the Red Sea, which is surrounded with deserts. Some supply, “and (*his people*) in the desert.” Sept. Syr. &c. C.  
**9** *Fight.* To serve those whom they had lately oppressed, would be doubly afflicting. Salien.—If these people had seriously attended to the instructions, which they might have derived from the fall of others, they would surely never have exposed themselves to fight against the high God. But they looked upon him in no other light than their own contemptible idols. Homer often represents them as wounded, and conquered by mortal men.  
**10** *Footmen.* They had no cavalry, ( C.) as God seemed to discourage any. H.—Even after Solomon’s time, they had not many horsemen. C.—The Israelites had before lost 4,000: now when they were full of confidence, and fought with valour, they behold 30,000 fall. The ark proved thus fatal to them. H.  
**11** *Slain.* Abulensis (q. 17,) thinks they were fighting in defence of the ark, when they might have saved themselves by flight; so that he does not despair of their salvation. God permitted them to lose their lives in the exercise of a holy ministry, which they had so scandalously profaned. C.  
**12** *Man.* The Jews say that Saul carried these melancholy tidings, and that Goliah slew the sons of Heli. H.  
**13** *Stool.* Heb. cisse; “a throne or tribunal,” where Heli sat to decide any controversies, and where he had blessed the mother of Samuel. C.—*God.* He had great reason to fear that this was the day when his sons would perish, and he apprehended that the ark would be in danger. H.  
**17** *Taken.* Every sentence expresses something more distressing to the aged judge and father; the flight and slaughter of his people, the ruin of his children, and the loss of the ark, which must have filled all Israel with a mortal gloom and terror, lest God should have abandoned them. So many dismal circumstances oppressing the heart of Heli, he fainted away, and falling backwards, expired. H.—The Scripture takes notice of his great age, that we might not think that he killed himself in despair. Salien.  
**18** *Named the ark*, &c. There is great reason, by all these circumstances, to hope that Heli died in the state of grace; and by his temporal punishments, escaped the eternal. Ch.—But many of the Fathers condemn him, and the Scripture says nothing of his conversion, or of that of his children, so that the matter is doubtful. C.—*Years.* Heb. “and heavy.”—*Forty.* Sept. “twenty,” in which they are followed by many Fathers. Euseb. Sulpit. &c.—Some reconcile the two texts by saying, that Heli and Samson judged together for twenty years. But the Sept. is probably corrupted, as the other versions agree with the original. C.  
**19** *Sudden*, through extreme affliction. M.—Josephus says the child was only in his seventh month, but alive. Abulensis thinks he did not long survive his mother.  
**21** *Ichabod.* That is, *Where is t* *he glory?* or, *there is no glory.* We see how much the Israelites lamented the loss of the ark, which was but the symbol of God’s presence amongst them. How much more ought Christians lament the loss of God himself, when by sin they have drove him out of their souls? Ch.—The ark is often called the glory of Israel. Isai. 66:21. Ps. 25:8. Ichabod might remind the people that the greatest loss had been sustained by them, as well as by his family. His mother had both in view the *ark*, Heli, and Phinees, *her husband*, ( H.) when she exclaimed, *ichabod*, “Woe! or, Alas! the glory.” Mendoza.—The Scripture does not mention Ophni’s posterity. But besides this posthumous son, Phinees had one elder, who now succeeded Heli in the pontificate, (C. 14:3. Josephus. Salien, A. 2940, A.C. 1113,) while Samuel took possession of the civil administration, and almost totally eclipsed the glory of Achitob. Many of the Fathers have even looked upon him as the high priest. But he was only a Levite, though, by dispensation, he acted sometimes as an extraordinary priest. S. Jerom c. Jov. i. and in 1 Cor. He reduced the people to a sense of their duty, and taught them to trust in the true God alone, and they would be protected, though deprived of the ark. This was also presently restored to them. H.

## Chapter 5

**1** *Azotus*, one of the principal cities of the Philistines. It is astonishing that God permits these infidels to touch the ark, He who resented the conduct of Oza, and of the Bethsamites, with such severity. But the law regarded the Israelites, and the pagans were ignorant of it. C.—The servant, who knows his master will, and does not obey, shall suffer many stripes; and those who have the happiness of professing the true religion, and dishonour it by their immorality, must expect to feel the heavy hand of the judge, much more than ignorant unbelievers. H.—The Philistines could not suppose that they had gained a victory over God, since they knew he might be displeased with the conduct of his people; and they soon began to perceive that they had brought the greatest misfortunes upon themselves.  
**2** *Dagon* is the same as Derceto, Atergatis, Venus, and the moon, ( C.) and was represented like a woman, ( T.) as far as the waist, and a fish below. H. Judg. 16:23.—The ark was placed near the idol, out of respect; ( C.) or as a trophy of the victory, which they attributed to Dagon. M.—Thus they hung up the arms of Saul in the temple of Asteroth; (C. 31:10,) and David placed the sword of Goliah in the tabernacle.  
**3** *Lord*, as if to acknowledge his superiority. C.—No sooner was the gospel preached, than the power of the idols began to decrease. Bede. W.  
**4** *Thresho* *ld.* The idol is treated worse the second time. M.  
**5** *The stump of*, seems to be wanting in Heb. H.—Only the lower part, which resembled a fish, (Dag) was left on its pedestal.—*Day.* The Philistines themselves established this custom, which was a tacit confession of the imbecility of the idol, which they nevertheless continued to adore. The prophet Sophonias, (1:9,) is supposed to accuse the Jews of imitating this superstition. The ancient Christians, out of respect, kissed the thresholds of the churches of the apostles and martyrs. Prudentius in S. Romano.—The Persians still refrain from treading on those of certain mosques, which are covered with silver. Tavernier 1:5.  
**6** *Emerods.* The particular disorder which attacked them, (Ps. 77:66,) is very uncertain. Some say it was the dysentery, or the fistula, or the venereal disease, &c. Eusebius believes that it was in punishment of their incontinency. It was very painful, and sometimes proved mortal, v. 12. Aristophanes assures us that the Athenians were punished with a shameful disorder, because they had not received the mysteries of Bacchus with due respect; and they were ordered, by the oracle, to make and carry aloft some obscene figures, before they could obtain a cure. Acharn. ii. 6.—*And in*, &c. The remainder of this verse is not found in Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, Arabic, &c. nor in many Greek and Latin copies. But it is conformable to the truth of history, since we read that figures of these animals were placed beside the ark, in memory of this event. C. 6:6.—*Mice*, or rats. Such vermin have often obliged people to abandon their country. Plin. viii. 28.—Bellon. (ii. 78,) testifies that he saw, near Gaza, such multitudes, as to depopulate whole fields; and, if Providence had not caused the birds, called boudres, to destroy them, the people could nav had no harvest.  
**7** *God.* The ark was terrible to this idol, as the relics of S. Babylas were to Apollo. W.  
**8** *Lords*, next in dignity to a king, like the Persian surena. Judg. 3:3 and 16:5.—*About.* Heb. “and they answered, let the ark … be carried unto Geth,” in which sense the Sept. seem to have taken it. But the Vulg. is more natural. Theodoret (q. 10,) concludes, that the people imagined the mortality proceeded from some natural cause; ( C.) otherwise it would have been very absurd to give such advice, as the ark would spread the contagion throughout the country, by being removed. From Geth it was sent to Accaron, when the magistrates of the city objected to its being admitted, v. 10. Jospehus says, however, that it visited all the five principal cities, as if to punish them for their impiety. H.  
**9** *Came upon*, to punish, as on other occasions, to protect. Ezec. 1:3 and 13:9. M.—*Parts.* Lit. “Their lower intestines coming out, rotted,” as v. 6. H.—Heb. “their malady was concealed.” Grot.—The emerods attacked them inwardly, with the most excruciating pains, for which they could find no remedy.—*Skins.* The ancients knew no greater luxury. Homer, Odys. i. and iii. The Heb. &c. take no notice of this particular; and there are many other omissions in the Books of Kings, which have been supplied from the Sept. C.—The skins were used instead of breeches, and to hold up the plaster and other medicines. T.  
**12** *Die*, at the sight of the ark, as the Bethsamites did afterwards. M.

## Chapter 6

**2** *Diviners.* The *priests* generally pretended to a knowledge of magic, among the pagans. C.  
**3** *If*, &c. The lords were already determined to send back the ark. But the priests knew that some still would not believe that it was the cause of their affliction. To convince all, they try an experiment, which would decide the matter; and in case the ark went back, some suitable presents must accompany it, as a propitiation ( H.) for the sin which they would not ( M.) then doubt had been incurred. H.—Though God stands in need of nothing, all must acknowledge their dependence on him. The pagans always made some present, when they appeared before their idols or monarchs, and God requires the like testimony of submission. Ex. 23:15.  
**5** *Provinces.* Heb. seranim, “lords.”—*Emerods.* Theodoret observes, that the tombs of the martyrs were adorned with figures of eyes, &c. in gratitude for their having procured redress for the afflicted.—*Israel*, whose ark you have treated in an improper manner. C.—You shall thus confess that He chastises, and grants health. M.—*Gods.* Not only Dagon, but the other idols, were humbled, ( H.) though the Heb. word denotes also one god, or princes, &c.  
**6** *Hearts.* Even these confess that obduracy proceeds from men; ( W.) though Calvin would make God the author of it. H.  
**7** *New cart.* It would have been deemed irreverent to use one that had been employed for other profane purposes, 2 K. 6:3.—*Home.* All these circumstances tended to prevent the ark from being conveyed home, ( C.) unless Providence interfered.  
**8** *Box.* Heb. argaz, (which the Sept. retain. H.) means also “a purse or basket.” C.—Josephus (vi. 1,) says, “the box was placed upon the ark.” H.—We do not read what became of these presents afterwards: but it is supposed that they were kept in the sanctuary till the time of the captivity. C.  
**9** *Way.* Josephus observes, that they stationed the kine at three lane ends; ( H.) and, as we may infer from the Heb. (v. 12,) rather with their heads turned from Bethsames. But, by this conduct, did they not tempt God? Some believe that He inspired them on this occasion, ( E.) that even his enemies might be convinced, ( H.) the grace of prophecy being frequently granted to wicked men, like Balaam: others believe that He gave success to their plan, though it was dictated by superstition. Even the devil sometimes speaks the truth. Mendoza. C.—People frequently use to pitch upon signs, to which God often assented. Prov. 16:33. M. Gen. 24:14. H.  
**13** *Wheat*, about Pentecost, in May; so that the ark must have been taken in November. M.  
**14** *Bethsamite*, not the renowned general. C.—*Stone*, which served instead of an altar. M.—*Lord.* Some pretend that the lords of the Philistines followed so far, and offered this holocaust, as the cart belonged to them: but the Bethsamites might suppose that they had abandoned their property, as well as the golden figures; and, as the city belonged to the priests, it is most probable that they would perform this office. Males indeed were to be offered in the tabernacle. But this was an extraordinary case; so that, if there were no priests, the sacrifice might be lawful ( C.) by dispensation, as we see Samuel and Elias did the like. H.—The kine and cart being consecrated to God, it was thought that they could not be turned to a more suitable purpose. C.—The ark was also present, on account of which, sacrifices were offered in the tabernacle. The arguments of Abulensis, (q. 19,) who accuses the Bethsamites of sin on this account, are not therefore satisfactory. M.  
**15** *Vessels.* Prot. less properly, “jewels of gold.” H.  
**16** *Day.* It was distant about 18 miles. C.—*Provinces.* Heb. “lords.” Some think that only five images of each sort were inclosed in the box: others suppose that the people of each village presented a golden mouse, to satisfy their own devotion, and that they might not be infested with such vermin. Clarius thinks they also sent an equal number of the other images of the anus. C. v. H.  
**18** *Abel.* A stone or rock, on which the Jews say Abraham had offered sacrifice; (S. Jer. Trad. T.) Heb. “or mourning,” was so called afterwards, on account of so many being slain; ( M.) so the place, to which the Egyptians accompanied the remains of Jacob, was styled “Abol,” *the mourning of Egypt.* Gen. 50:11. H.—The Sept. read Abon, “the stone.” All the towns belonging to the Philistines, as far as this place, sent each their golden images, or contributed towards those which were presented by the five lords.—*Which*, ark, according to the Vulg. though some would explain it of the stone. The ark might remain here for some time, and would probably have continued longer, if the people had not been so much afflicted. In the mean time, this record may have been written, as it was afterwards inserted in this book. C.—*Which*, though of the feminine gender, is referred to stone, because Abol is of that description, ( M.) and we find several such allusions to the Heb. in our version. Prot. “unto the great *stone of* Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the Lord, *which stone remaineth* unto this day,” &c. H. Vatab. &c.—Others think that the ark remained there till it was removed to Cariathiarim. C. 7:1. Malvenda says, the *memory* of the transaction was fresh till the author wrote; while others maintain, that the golden figures continued with the ark till that time. C.—The Roman Sept. omits the words *till this day;* and reads, “where they placed upon it (the stone) the ark … upon the stone in the field,” &c. Then with the Alex. copy, and Procopius, &c. it subjoins 19. “And the sons of Jechonias did not approve, among the men of Bethsames, that they saw the ark of the Lord, and he slew of them 70 men, and 50,000 of the people.” Theodoret suspects that they were more impious than the rest. But we might as well say that they shewed more ( C.) reverence, as we may explain *slew them*, to denote the two curious citizens, ( H.) if any dependence could be had on this addition. C.  
**19** *Seen;* and curiously looked into. It is likely this plague reached to all the neighbouring country, as well as the city of Bethsames. Ch.—For we need not suppose that all these deaths took place in one day. The ark seems to have continued there for some time, v. 18. Heb. “because they had looked into, *or* at the ark.” H.—It was unlawful, even for the Levites, to touch or to look *at* the ark uncovered; ( T. Num. 4:15, 20,) and the Heb. expression *into*, is often taken in this sense. Prov. 7:15 and 11:4.—*Men* of rank. S. Greg. &c. “Ancients.” Chal. Some would suppose that only these 70 perished, and were of as much value as 50,000 of the common people: for they will not allow that he latter number was slain. Out of that number, 70 were made victims of the divine justice. T. Sa.—Bochart translates, “he slew 70 out of 50,000.” The Syr. and Arab. read, “5070 men.” Josephus only admits 70 who were slain, “because they dared to touch the ark with their profane hands, as they were not priests.” Heb. “and he slew of the people 70 men, 50,000 men. C.—Kennicott seems to suspect that a cipher has been added in the Heb. at the end. Prot. “50,000, and threescore and ten men.” H.—Some would insert *aderant* in the Vulg. and 50,000 “were present.” D.—The Chal. Sept. &c. constantly retain these numbers, and we must not judge of God severity by our feeble reason. C.—This decision is the most common. M.—The people had indulged their curiosity, to see whether the Philistines had taken the tables of the law out of the ark, &c. Serarius.—As the ark was terrible to the infidels, so it was also to those true believers, who treated it with disrespect. W.  
**20** *Us.* These words may denote that they thought God too severe, or else, that they judged themselves unworthy of his presence. There is no proportion between an offence of God, and what the creature can do to make him satisfaction. C.  
**21** *Up.* This is the import of the Heb. The Vulg. *reducite*, “bring it back,” insinuates, that the Bethsamites desired the people of Cariathiarim to convey the ark to their city, on the road to Silo, where they probably thought it ought to be placed, in the tabernacle. But it seems God ordered it otherwise, and the ark was never restored to its former splendid station, surrounded with all the vessels and ornaments of the tabernacle. David made something similar, and place an altar before it, while the Mosaic tabernacle and altar were removed from Silo to Nobe, (C. 21:1) and afterwards to Gabaon. 2 Par. 1:5. Salien ( A. 3030) doubts not but they were thence translated to Solomon’s temple, during the octave of the dedication, along with those of David, from Mount Sion. 2 Par. 5:2 and 8:3. Why the ark was not placed in this most magnificent abode, but removed from the stone of Abel to the houses of Abinadab, of Obededom, of David in Sion, till all the original ornaments, prescribed by God to Moses, with a still more splendid apparatus, met to adorn the temple of Solomon, we cannot easily explain. Perhaps it might be to render that event more glorious, and to represent the troubled state of the Jewish Synagogue, immediately preceding the appearance of the great Redeemer, who would establish a church without spot or wrinkle, shining brighter than the sun, and replenished with all heavenly graces. H.—Cariathiarim is the same place as Cariathbaal, and Baala, (Jos. 15:9, 60.) Baalim Juda, (2 K. 6:2) and Sedeiarim, about ten miles from Jerusalem. Gabaa was “a hill,” ( C.) belonging to the same city, where the house of Abinadab stood; ( H.) and Nobe was also in the vicinity, while Silo was much farther north. C.—The priests still remained, and offered sacrifice in the tabernacle, though occasionally some of them might come to offer extraordinary victims before the ark, in those private houses which were thus converted, as it were, into the holy of holies. Salien, A. 2941, were he observes from S. Jerom, that the tabernacle was removed to Nobe about the same time as the ark was deposited at Cariathiarim; and no doubt both the translations were in consequence of the divine command, signified by the mouth of his prophet Samuel. H.

## Chapter 7

**1** *In Gabaa.* That is, on the hill, for Gabaa signifieth a hill. Ch. 1 Par. 13:6.—It was perhaps the citadel, ( H.) or an elevated situation, such as were generally chosen for the temples both of the true and of false gods. C.—Abinadab was a Levite of renowned virtue. M.—The people of this city knew that the ark was a source of blessings to those who received it with respect; and, that the Bethsamites had been punished only for their irreverence. W.—Samuel was first consulted before the people, in a body, undertook to remove the ark; and here he was probably recognized for the judge of Israel, in which character he henceforward appears, exhorting all to obey the Lord with sincerity. He appoints a general assembly at Masphath, to enter into a solemn covenant with the Lord, and to adopt means for recovering their liberty. We have only a very concise account of these important transactions, owing to the modesty of the author, which the Holy Spirit would teach us to imitate. C.—*Sanctified.* Chal. “set over,” ( M.) prepared by suitable purifications, &c. C.—Some think, that Eleazar received the priestly or the Levitical consecration, Num. 8:7. We have no proof that he was of the family of Aaron, nor does his name occur in the genealogies of the Levites, as they are perhaps too short. Josephus (vi. 2.) asserts that he was a Levite. C.—But even a laic, like Obededon of Geth, might have been the guardian of the ark, as he would not have to touch it. Salien, A.C. 1112.—Eleazar had two brothers, who acted in the same capacity when David intended to remove the ark to Sion. At that time he was perhaps dead, or decrepit, as his father might be on this occasion. H.—It is not improbable but they were of the race of Aaron. T.  
**2** *Year.* Some would date all the subsequent events from this period. But is it credible that Samuel should neglect for twenty years to make this exhortation to the people? and how will it be true, that God humbled the Philistines during the whole time ( C.) of his administration, which perhaps ( H.) only lasted so many years? (v. 13.) C.—It is more probable, therefore, that the power of the enemy was broken by the destruction caused by the presence of the ark, which kept them under due restraint for along time; and when they attempted, once more, to molest the Israelites, they were entirely discomfited by a miraculous storm, at the prayer of Samuel, v. 10. Salien ( A. 2960) allows, that this took place in the twentieth year since the ark came to Cariathiarim, in which year Samuel appointed his children judges at Bersabee, though he continued to act, and was judge for twenty-three years, (some say thirty-eight) and even under the reign of Saul had almost an absolute sway, as the prophet of the Lord. H.—*Rested:* continued steadfast, (Sanctius) “cried unto,” (Pagnin) “Looked ( H.) *or* returned,” Sept. “Lamented after the Lord.” Heb. M.—They were not soon induced to break this solemn covenant. Isai. 7:2. T.  
**3** *Saying.* When the ark was translated, ( C.) and on many other occasions, this was the theme of his discourse to the Israelites, pressing them to cease from doing evil, and to perform good works. H.—Thus he preached every year in the different cities. v. 16. Lyran.—*Astaroth* *.* These were the principal idols of the country, (Salien, Judg. 2:11) under which all the others were included. M.—*Prepare.* God lays this injunction upon us, to remind us of our liberty, and we beg that he would convert us, acknowledging the necessity of his grace. C.—“God does not require impossibilities, but by his command, admonishes thee to do what thou canst, and to pray for what thou art not able to perform, and he assists thee, that thou mayst be able to perform it.” C. Trid. vi. 11. S. Aug. &c.  
**5** *Masphath* lay south of Jerusalem, ( C.) and was a convenient place for all to meet at. M. They came armed, and the Philistines ( C.) suspecting their designs, proceeded to attack them. H.  
**6** *Lord*, having purified themselves with it. Ex. 19:24. Others think that it was a kind of a protestation, that they were willing to perish if they proved faithless; (Sa.) or a symbol that they rejected every vestige of idolatry, and every sin, with true repentance. Sanctius. T.—Water was also the most ancient species of libation, before honey, and afterwards wine were adopted. Porphyrius.—Though the law did not prescribe it, there was not prohibition. On the last day of the feast of tabernacles, the people went to the pool of Silo to fetch water, and to pour it out in the temple, as a libation to the Lord; and it is thought that Jesus Christ alludes to this custom, Jo. 7:24. Lamy. Introd. See 2 K. 23:16. C.—*Fasted.* They confess their sins and do penance, while Samuel sits as judge, (Salien) an had been endeavouring for twenty years to excite them to repentance, and to adhere to the one true religion. T.  
**8** *Philistines.* Those who distrust their own strength, and join true repentance with prayer, striving to interest the friends of God in their cause, may confidently hope for victory. H.  
**9** *Suckling lamb.* Any might be used, when eight days old, except for the paschal lamb, which must be older; *a yearling.* Ex. 23:9. Lev. 22:27.—*Offered it*, either by the hands of the priests, or by dispensation, which authorized him to sacrifice out of the tabernacle.—*Whole*, without blemish; (Eccli. 46:19) or, not having time to divide it, according to the ritual. Lev. 1:12. He consumed even the skin. Salien.—Sept. “with all the people.”  
**10** *Israel.* The princes of the Tyrians had come to the assistance of the enemy; (Eccli. 46:21. C.) but all in vain. The greatness of the army only increased the greatness of the carnage, when the Lord enters the lists. H.—the sacred penman speaks with great modesty of this victory, which is nevertheless one of the most important recorded in Scripture. The Philistines could not recover themselves for 20 years; they found it necessary to restore the cities which they had taken, ( C.) to relinquish the tribute, and to come to such conditions as Samuel imposed upon them. He suffered them, however, to keep possession of some strong holds, such as Gabaa, from which they were expelled by Jonathan. Salien says in the 22d year of Samuel, and the last of Achitob, the high priest, A. 2961.  
**11** *Bethchar*, “the house of the penetrator.” *Cor* denotes the celestial fluid, which the Philistines probably supposed was discharged by the heavens, independently of the great Creator. Hence their punishment was very appropriate. Parkhurst.—The latter heathens always represented their Jupiter armed with thunder and lightning—  
**12** *Sen*, “the tooth,” a craggy rock of that appearance. Syr. *Beth Jasan.* C.—some take it to be the same with Bethchar. Malvenda.—It was before ignoble, (Salien) and the situation not known, till this monument was erected, with the inscription, *Thus far*, &c.—*Help;* “Aben-ezer,” mentioned before, C. 4:1. The religious monuments were not prohibited by the law. Lev. 26:1. Samuel would take every precaution that they should not become objects of idolatry, as he was under the immediate influence of the Holy Spirit. C.  
**13** *Any m* *ore*, for a long time, ( M.) during *Samuel’s* administration; for we find them again attacking Saul. C. 13. This expression is often used to denote a cessation of some continuance. Isai. 23:12, 15. 2 K. 7:10.  
**14** *Geth*, which two cities still continued in their possession. Others, which had fallen to the share of Dan, they gave up, which explains Judg. 18:1, 31.—*Philistines.* Here ended the forty years’ servitude. C.—Salien ( A. 2860) rather thinks that it terminated in the death of Samson, when it was judged expedient to entrust the reins of government into the hands of an ole man, Heli, the high priest, as there was no need of an expert general, the heads of the Philistines being all destroyed. Judg. 13:1. H.—*Amorrhites:* the dispersed nations of Chanaan were all dept under. C.  
**15** *Li* *fe;* as sole judge for twenty years, (Gordon. D.) and conjointly with Saul till he died, almost 100 years old, a year or two before the unfortunate king. Saul put him on a level with himself; (C. 11:7) and he continued to be regarded as the oracle of Israel ever since he was about forty years old; ( C.) or he did not long survive the election of the new king, ( M.) as Tirin, Sanctius, &c. reduce his reign to two years, allowing thirty-eight to Samuel, so that both filled up the space of forty years. Act. 13:20. The life of Samuel, on this supposition, will not much exceed sixty, and he must have come into power in early life. C. 12:2. H.—This verse is no proof that the present book was written long after Samuel’s time. D.  
**16** *Places.* Sept. “in all these holy places.” Some take *Bethel* to mean the city, where the ark was, ( C.) or the holy of holies, in the tabernacle, at Silo, &c. H.—The northern tribes might meet him at Bethel; those on the east of the Jordan, at *Galgala*, of Benjamin; and the tribes of Juda, Simeon, and Dan, might have an opportunity of hearing the holy prophet, and decide their controversies, at *Masphath.* C.—Thus Samuel gave an excellent instruction to pastors and governors, to watch over their people. H.  
**17** *Ramatha;* his native place. His high office would not allow him to remain always near the tabernacle. C. 1:11. and 28. C.—*Lord*, by his direction, ( M.) both to satisfy his own devotion, and that he might consult the Lord when the people wanted advice. C.

## Chapter 8

**1** *Old.* Houbigant would translate, “when he ws growing old,” *senesceret*, as he supposes he was now nearly sixty, having judged about twenty-five years, and living another twenty as partner with Saul. Prol. lxii. See C. 7:15. H.—*Judges*, as his delegates in the southern parts of the country. C.—Josephus says one of them was stationed at Bethel. Ant. vi. 3.  
**2** *In*, or “as far as” *B* *ersabee*, from Dan, that is, throughout Palestine. C.  
**3** *Judgment.* Samuel was not to blame, and hence he was not punished like Heli. M.—However, the misconduct of the children of these two judges, in succession, ( H.) gave occasion to the people to demand a king, who might not be tempted by bribes. W.—It is surprising that most of the great men who are mentioned in history, had degenerate children. C.—Such were some of David’s sons, as well as Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, &c. H.—Was it because their fathers were too much taken up with the affairs of state, to watch over the education of their children? or rather, because these young men confided too much on the merits of their family, and took no pains to tread in the footsteps of their parents? C.—“We have here, says Josephus, a manifest proof that children do not always resemble their parents, but sometimes good men spring from the wicked; and on the contrary, the virtuous have an evil progeny.”  
**5** *Judge us*, in a different manner from what had been hitherto done. H.—By a crying ingratitude, they reject the government of a wise old man, who had rendered them the most signal services. Perhaps the power of Naas, king of the Ammonites, might afford them some pretext for acting as they did. C.—*As all*, &c. They seem to prefer the dominion of kings, who ruled over the surrounding barbarous nations as they thought proper, ( H.) before one who should be tied down to observe the laws, prescribed by God, ( M.) in case the Israelites should wish to have a king. Deut. 17. H.—In the East, monarchy was the most ancient form of government. Tacit. Hist. iv. Just. i. “Principio, imperium penes Reges erat.”  
**6** *Samuel.* Nothing could be more disrespectful to him, nor more ungrateful to God, who had distinguished them from all other nations, and had taken the government upon himself, and appointed the judges as his lieutenants. The foolish Israelites wished to throw off this sweet yoke, and to be ruled in an arbitrary manner, like the infidels, as if God could not otherwise protect them from their enemies.—*Lord.* Josephus says that he passed the night without food or sleep, and the Lord appeared to him. The will or petition “of the people, filled Samuel with great uneasiness, who on account of his innate justice, did not like the regal power, as being to exorbitant. He rather approved of an aristocracy, as more conducive to the welfare of the people.” Ant. vi. 4. He means such an aristocracy as the Israelites had been accustomed to, under the guidance of men divinely commissioned, whence he elsewhere very properly styles it a *theocracy*, or “the government of God.” H.  
**7** *Thee.* “God, in anger, grants a person what he desires wrongfully.” S. Aug.—He permits the people to follow their own plans; and the Hebrews believe, that he gave them Saul to punish them, being well apprised of his proud and cruel nature. Cuneus Rep. C.—*Rejected*, &c. The government of Israel hitherto had been a theocracy: in which God himself immediately ruled, by laws which he had enacted, and by judges extraordinarily raised up by himself: and therefore he complains that his people rejected him, in desiring a change of government, ( Ch). and wishing to appoint their own magistrates. The priests and judges had been commissioned by God. Ex. 19. Deut. 17. W.  
**8** *Thee.* He comforts Samuel, by observing that it was not so much any fault of his, as the people’s habitual fickle temper, which made them seek for this change. M.  
**9** *The right.* That is, the *manner* (mishpat) after which he shall proceed, having no one to control him, when he has the power in his hands. Ch.—He intimates that the kings will frequently act in a tyrannical manner, v. 11. M.—But the holy Fathers observe, that herein they do what is unjust, and contrary to God’s law. S. Gregory remarks, that Achab is punished for taking the vineyard of Naboth, (3 K. 21) while David will not take a piece of ground belonging to Ornan, even for an altar, without first paying a just price for it. 1 Par. 21:25. Some of these *rights* or customs are prohibited to the *king.* Deut. 17:16. It is true, kings enjoy great prerogatives above judges, but never contrary to the law. They cannot take their subjects’ goods: but the latter are bound to contribute to the maintenance of government; and, if they refuse, may be compelled. If kings should be guilty of excesses, “yet them are not to be deposed by the people, … but must be tolerated with patience, peace, and meekness, till God, by his sovereign authority, left in his Church, dispose of them, which his divine wisdom and goodness often deferred to do, as here he expressly forewarneth, (v. 18) because he will punish the sins of the people by suffering evil princes to reign.” Job 34:30. Conc. Later. c. iii. de hœret. W. See S. Thomas, 2. 2. q. 12. a. 2.—We may here also remark, that the people petitioned for a king, yet God made the choice; and, when he proved rebellious, selected another by the hand of Samuel, though he permitted the former to enjoy his dignity till death. C. 13. and 31. H.—Grotius (Jur. i. 1. and 4.) maintains that Samuel here proposes the just rights of the king, and that the prince has a greater right to any one’s personal property, for the public good, than he has himself. In effect, the eastern kings regarded their subjects as slaves. But those who governed the Hebrews were to follow a different conduct; and Samuel is so far from approving of what some of them would do, that he mentions their tyranny, in order to dissuade the people from what they so inconsiderately requested. C.—The misconduct of rulers, is one of the most trying inconveniences to which a nation can be exposed. In such circumstances, “bear, say a pagan historian, ( H.) with the luxury and avarice of those who hold dominion, as with other natural evils. There will be vices as long as men subsist, but neither will these continue for ever, and they are compensated by the intervention of better things or men.” *Meliorum interventu pensantur* *.* Tacit.—Grotius at last seems to conclude, (Sup. c. iv. p. 97) that the right of the king here specified is only apparent, in as much as it includes “the obligation of making no resistance.” H.  
**11** *Chariots;* to be drivers, ( M.) or will make them fight from them.—*Footmen*, or guards. Xenophon places 4000 armed with bucklers before, and 2000 with lances all round the chariot of Cyrus. See C. 22:17.  
**12** *Centurions*, or body-guards. M.—These offices might be honourable, but at the same time disagreeable, when people were forced to accept of them, and to neglect their more pleasing agricultural employment. The multitude of officers increases the expenses of the prince, and falls heavy upon the people. C.  
**14** *Vineyards*, as Achab did, though he first proposed to buy it.  
**15** *Tenth.* God had already claimed one tithe, which he had abandoned to his sacred ministers. We do not read that the kings of the Hebrews ever claimed ( C.) a second tithe precisely, ( H.) though they might have done it b the example of other kings. Lev. 27:30. Joseph had asserted the fifth part of the revenues of Egypt for its monarchs. Gen. 47:26.—*Eunuchs.* Heb. saris, denotes an officer of the court. It was not lawful for the Israelites to make any eunuchs, but they might employ foreigners.  
**16** *Goodliest*, in strength ( C.) and beauty. M.—Solomon made his people work at his buildings, and David employed an officer in the fields, 1 Par. 27:26. Sept. have read in a different manner, “He will tithe … your excellent droves of oxen.” C.—They also specify, “the tithe of asses for his work.” H.  
**17** *Servants*, or slaves. The Hebrews enjoyed greater liberty than any of the nations in the East, yet they are styled slaves. C. 17:8. They were nearly on the same footing as the ancient Germans. “Each governed in his own place of abode. The Lord requires of them a quantity of corn, cattle, or clothing, and so far the slave obeys;” *servus hactenus paret* *.* Tacit. Germ. The Hebrews were also bound to follow the king to battle. The Egyptians, Persians, &c. were under greater oppression. Herodotus (iii. 31,) informs us, that when Cambyses designed to marry his own sister, his counsellors replied, that they found no express law to this effect; but there was another, “that the king of Persia may do whatever he please.” The highest officers, and even his brothers, were styled, “slaves, Δουλοι, of the great king.” Arist. Mund.  
**18** *The face*, privately; for even groans will not be free. M.—The event justified this prediction, as most of the kings of the Hebrews ruled like tyrants, and what was worse, engaged their subjects in idolatry, and drew down the heaviest judgments upon them. C.—*Hear you*, so as to deliver you from oppression, though he is always willing to hear those who truly repent. W.  
**19** *Over us.* The populace is generally inconstant, and fond of changes. M.  
**20** *Nations.* We are neither better nor worse than the rest. What extravagance! for a people to abandon a state of happiness, and the dominion of God, and to prefer the service of a man! C.—*For us.* This was the pretext, as Naas threatened them with war. C. 12:12. M.

## Chapter 9

**1** *Abiel*, who is also called Ner. 1 Par. 8:33. Cajetan.—*Strong.* Heb. “a mighty man of power,” either of body, or of riches.  
**2** *Goodlier*, better proportioned, more handsome, ( H.) as the daughters of men are styled good, or *fair.* Gen. 6:1. People seek for corporal advantages in those who command. The poets always represent their deities and heroes as taller than the rest of men. A king of Sparta was fined for marrying a little woman. Arist. Polit. iv. The Ethiopians give their highest offices to those who have the most engaging appearance. Herod. iii. 20. C.—Little people may be elegant, but never majestic or perfectly beautiful. Arist. Ethic. iv. 3. M.—*Choice*, is taken in the same sense as goodly, and does not intimate that Saul was one of the elect. Carthus.  
**3** *Ass* *es.* The greatest noblemen rode upon such. Judges 5:10. A prince of Esau fed asses. Gen. 30:24. Agriculture, and keeping sheep, were the employment of men of the first eminence in the heroic ages, as hunting and other equally laborious exercises are now in fashion. C.  
**4** *Salisa*, the ancient Segor, ( M.) or rather a place 15 miles from Diospolis. Euseb.—*Salim*, or Sual, not far from Galgal. C. 13:17.  
**5** *Suph*, where Ramatha, the birth-place of Samuel, was situated. C. 1:1. C.  
**6** *Famous.* Chal. “honourable.” Sept. “covered with glory.” The observations of a servant may often claim attention. Saul seemed to be less acquainted with this extraordinary personage than his servant. H.  
**7** *What.* Were they uninformed of the disinterestedness of Samuel? or did they think that he would sell his oracles? By no means. But the manners of the ancients were very different from ours, and people chose to shew their respect for God, the king, prophets, &c. by making them some presents. People still never go to visit one another in Syria without something of the kind, as it would be deemed uncivil or cruel to act otherwise. See 3 K. 14:1. Mic. 3:11.—*Bread.* They would have made a present of some. Saul received two loaves. C. 10:4. See C. 16:20. Hence we may form some idea of the beautiful simplicity of those ages. People were then forced to carry their own provisions, as there were no inns which supplied any. C.—*Present. Sportula* means a little basket. H.—But here it is taken for a present, as meat was commonly given. M.—Cyrus sent his friends geese half eaten, from his own table, for greater distinction. Xenop. H.—Heb. “what have we?” Syr. “we have none of our provisions left.” C.  
**8** *Silver.* About seven-pence English.—*Stater*, ( H.) is put instead of Heb. “sicle.” M.  
**9** *A seer.* Because of his *seeing*, by divine light, hidden things, and things to come, ( Ch). by inspiration. W.—They had the things which they foretold so clearly in view. The Sybil cries out,  
**11** *Water*, perhaps for the sacrifice. Thus Fab. Victor says, “Rhea, according to the established custom, by which young women went to draw water for the sacrifices, proceeded to the fountain in the grove of Mars.” C.  
**12** *A sacrifice.* The law did not allow of sacrifices in any other place, but at the tabernacle, or temple, in which the ark of the covenant was kept; but Samuel, by divine dispensation, offered sacrifices in other places. For which dispensation this reason may be alleged, that the house of God in Silo, having lost the ark, was now cast off; as a figure of the reprobation of the Jews. Psal. 77:60, 67. And in Cariathiarim, where the ark was, there was neither tabernacle, nor altar. Ch.—At least that of Moses was in the tabernacle. See C. 6:21. H.—Samuel was just come up to the city, from a place called Naiot, where he instructed some of the prophets., C. 19:19. The maids point him out to Saul; and God, at the same time, reveals to his prophet, that the person who addressed him should be king. C.—*The high place. Excelsum.* The *excelsa*, or *high places*, so often mentioned in Scripture, were places of worship, in which were altars for sacrifice. These were sometimes employed in the service of the true God, as in the present case: but more frequently in the service of idols, and were called *Excelsa*, which is commonly (though perhaps not so accurately) rendered *high places;* not because they were always upon hills, for the very worst of all, which was that of Topheth, or *Geennom*, (Jer. 19) was in a valley; but because of the *high al* *tars*, and *pillars*, or *monuments* erected there, on which were set up the idols, or images of their deities; ( Ch). so that they might be called “the high things.” H.—Before Solomon built the temple, from the time that the tabernacle was deprived of the honour of having the ark, people immolated on such heights, 3 K. 3:2. M.—On one of these, at Ramatha, Samuel was going to offer a peace-offering, and to feast with the heads of the city, ( C.) or perhaps of the nation, who were expecting the result of his consultation of the Lord, respecting their petition of a king. H.  
**13** *The victim*, begging the blessing, which was the office of the most honourable person at table, as he also gave thanks for all. C.  
**14** *Midst.* That is, simply in the city, or entering the gate, where Samuel met them, v. 18.  
**15** *Ear*, privately. C.—Thus Jonathan promised to give David private information. C. 20:13. H.  
**16** *Ruler.* Heb. Nagid, “Leader.” Sept. “Archon.” Chal. “King.” The Israelites demanded a king, to lead them, and to fight for them; and Homer (Iliad iii.) gives this idea of the chief magistrate, “a good king and stout warrior,” which Alexander so much admired.—*Philistines.* They had been repressed by Samuel; but they had begun to gain the ascendancy, so as not to suffer the Israelites to have a blacksmith among them, &c. Saul gained some victories over them, and over the other enemies of his people, towards the beginning of his reign. C. 13. and 14. C.—*To me.* God threatened that he would not hear them, when they should grow weary ( H.) of their king. C. 8:18. But he protects his people against the efforts of their foreign enemies. M.—Oppression of the innocent cries to heaven for vengeance. W.  
**18** *Gate.* Sept. “city.” Chal. “within the gate,” where business was transacted.  
**19** *Place*, while Samuel retired, for a while, to his own house. He sends Saul to the assembly, ( C.) where he would meet him to dine. H.—*Heart*, or desirest to know. M.  
**20** *Best.* The regal power, which all desired. Heb. “to *or* on whom is all the desire of Israel?” Any great felicity is called a desire, as the Messias, the spouse in the Canticle, 5:16. Ag. 2:8. Sept. “to whom the beautiful things of Israel?”  
**21** Jemini, or Benjamin, which was always one of the smallest tribes, and, since the unfortunate war, still more reduced; so that none of the other tribes could well take umbrage, or be filled with jealousy, when they saw a king selected from it.—*Last.* Though all were equally noble, yet some families were more numerous, possessed greater riches, or had filled the posts of honour more frequently than others. Nothing can be more charming than the modesty of Saul on this occasion. C.—Happy would he have been, had he continued always to cherish the like sentiments. H.—He and his posterity might then have long enjoyed the regal dignity. C. 13:13. M.  
**22** *At the head.* Sept. “among the first of those … seventy men,” which number Josephus also has instead of 30. Saul’s servant was probably an Israelite, who had hired himself for a time. The first place, at the head of the table, was the most honourable. Luke 14:8. The king of Persia placed his most trusty friend at his left hand, and those of the highest dignity, in order at his right. Cyropæd. vii. &c. C.  
**24** *Shoulder.* It was the left, ( M.) as the right shoulder belonged to the priest, and laymen were not allowed to taste of it after it had been offered in sacrifice. Lev. 7:32. Some suppose that Samuel had this right shoulder for his portion. But he was not a priest. C.—This part was assigned to the most eminent man at table; and Josephus calls it “the royal portion.” M.—Heb. “the shoulder, and what was upon it, (*or* he held it up) and set it (the whole quarter) before Saul.” Aquila, &c. translate “the thigh,” *left* or reserved. Sept. “laid by.” It was then the fashion to place large pieces of meat before those who were to be most honoured. Gen. 18:6. Homer, &c.—*People.* Heb. “till now it has been ket for thee, I said, I have invited the people.” He insinuates that he knew of his coming, though it seemed so accidental, even when he invited the company. Sept. “eat, for it is placed before thee, as a memorial, by the people, cut it in pieces.” H.—As the shoulder supports a burden, so the king was reminded to maintain the interests of the commonwealth. M.  
**25** *House*, probably giving him some instructions respecting his future dignity.—*As he*, &c. This seems to be a second translation of the former sentence, taken from the Sept. It is omitted in several Latin MSS. C.—Sept. “and he went down from the Bama (perhaps “the steps” or high places, where the sacrifice and feast had been celebrated) into the city; and they made a bed for Saul, on the house top; and he lay down, (26) and when the day dawned, Samuel,” &c. The roofs are flat in those countries, and such an airy situation would be most agreeable in such hot climates. H.—The common people, generally, only spread a mat on the ground, and covered themselves with a sheet; to take their rest, either under a gallery, or in the open air. Homer places his strangers, with their upon the ground under the gallery, which was erected before the house. Aristophanes (in Vespis) mentions the custom of sleeping on the house top. See 2 K. 16:22. C.—Saul had not been educated with the greatest delicacy. M.  
**27** *Before us, and.* Heb. (“and he passed on,”) agreeably to his master’s order. H.

## Chapter 10

**1** *Vial*, in the form of a *lentil.* Plin. xviii. 12.—*Oil.* This anointing seems to have been peculiar to the kings, priests, and prophets of the Hebrews, who prefigured Jesus, the great anointed of God. S. Aug. in Ps. xliv. The custom was very ancient. Judg. 9:8. It is thought that those kings, who succeeded their fathers by their birth-right, and without opposition, did not receive any unction. C.—But the silence of Scripture is no proof on this head; and the Fathers seem to be convinced that the custom subsisted till Christ appeared. S. Just. dial. &c. H.—The Rabbins pretend that the sacred ointment was used for the kings of Juda, but not for those of Israel. It is not probable that it was used for either. Ex. 30:32. 3 K. 1:39. We read that Jehu was anointed king of Israel; (4 K. 9:6,) and we may suppose that common oil was used, in his regard, as well as for the other kings. The perfume or balm of Judea, does not spot the garments on which it may fall. Plin. xii. 25. It was poured on the head; the Rabbins say in the from of a crown, ( C.) or cross. H.—But this is uncertain. The ceremony has been preserved, with respect to Christian kings, who, according to Innocent I, should be anointed on the shoulders and arms, while prelates receive the unction on the head.—*Kissed him*, out of respect. Ps. 2:12. C.—*Behold.* Heb. “Is it not because?” &c. H.—*And thou … prince.* All this is wanting in the Heb. &c. But it is conformable to the Vat. Sept.; ( C.) the Alex. has “to be prince over his people, over Israel? and thou shalt rule over the people of the Lord, and shalt save it from its enemies around;” as we have explained. C. 9:16. H.—Saul was anointed with *a small vessel*, to signify that his kingdom should not subsist long; and with *oil*, to remind him of mercy, light, and health to his people. S. Greg. W.  
**2** *Rachel*, near Bethlehem. Gen. 35:16.—*South.* Sept. or “mid-day.” Heb. Tseltsach, is very obscure. Some take it for a proper name. C.—Prot. “at Zelzah.” Others for some musical instrument, as if these travellers were “dancing,” as the Sept. insinuate, and playing on musical instruments, like the prophets, v. 5. It does not appear how Saul would come near Bethlehem, in his journey from Ramatha to Gabaa, unless Ramatha lay more to the south that it is represented, which is could not do, being in the tribe of Ephraim; so that we might translate the Heb. “Thou wilt find two men of Zelzelach, a place near the tomb of Rachel, on the borders of Benjamin, and they,” &c.  
**3** *Thabor*, very distant from the famous mountain ( C.) in Zabulon. M.—*Bethel.* Where there was at that time an altar of God; it being one of the places where Samuel judged Israel, ( Ch.) and which had always been considered as a place of devotion, since Jacob had his vision. Gen. 28:19. It lay to the east of Gabaa, so that Saul might easily meet these pilgrims. C.—*Wine*, for libations, as the other things were for a sacrifice and feast, as well as for presents to the officiating priests.  
**4** *Hand.* They would be very acceptable to Saul, who had none. The strangers might suppose that they could purchase more at Bethel. C.  
**5** *The hill of God.* Gabaa, in which there was also at that time, a *high place* or *altar.* Ch.—The prophets were not molested by the infidels, in performing their devotions, as people consecrated to the Lord, who do not meddle with war, are privileged by the consent of nations. Grot. Jur. iii. 11. 10. C.—*Prophets.* These were men whose office it was to sing hymns and praises to God; for such in holy writ are called *prophets*, and their singing praises to God is called *prophesying.* See 1 Par. alias 1 Chron. 15:22 and 25:1. Now there were in those days colleges, or schools for training up these prophets; and it seems there was one of these schools at this *hill of God;* and another at Naioth in Ramatha. See 1 Samuel 19:20, 21. &c. Ch.—The Jews say there were in every city of Judea congregations of this nature. They lived like monks, abstaining, for the most part, from marriage, though some had children, 4 K. 4:1. They had a superior at their head, to whom God frequently revealed future things. The rest were instructed how to explain the prophecies, to compose and sing canticles. Some of them were inspired, like Saul, only for a time. It is supposed that Samuel instituted these colleges, and this is the first time we find them mentioned. C.—They were of infinite service in preserving the true religion. H.  
**6** *Spirit* of piety. M.—*Man.* Thou shalt act, and entertain sentiments worthy of a great prince, ( C.) and be no longer employed in rustic works. M.—*Cape regis animum et in istam fortunam, qua dignus es, istam continentiam profer* *.* “Adopt the sentiments of a king, said the deputies of Alexander to Abdalonymus, but carry along with you this moderation, when you assume the dignity which you deserve to enjoy.” Curtius iv.  
**7** *Find.* Undertake any enterprise, how difficult soever, which God may propose to thee. C.  
**8** *Ga* *lgal.* Here also by dispensation was an altar of God. Ch.—*To do.* Saul went thither, after the victory which he had obtained over the Ammonites, when he was confirmed in his dignity. C. 11:14. But the mention of seven days, seems to indicate that Samuel is here speaking of that event, when the war against the Philistines was at hand, and Saul neglected to wait the appointed term, before he ventured to offer sacrifice. C. 13:8. C.—Some think that Samuel engages always to meet him at Galgal, on any important business, within the space of seven days. Serar.—Others translate, “I will be at Galgal with thee, and we will offer sacrifices, for seven days.” C.—Prot. “I will come down to thee to offer burnt-offerings,” &c. which is conformable to the Sept. Indeed Saul was probably blamed for offering the victims himself. H.—Obedience was enjoined him to try his humility. S. Greg. W.  
**11** *Prophets.* This proverb received a fresh confirmation, when Saul was going to seize David, and was forced by the Spirit to join with the college of prophets, in singing God’s praises. C. 19. ult. H.—It may be applied to those who are unexpectedly raised to a high dignity, or enabled to speak or to do extraordinary things, like the apostles, when they spoke various languages &c. Delrio adag. 178. C.  
**12** *Their father.* That is, their teacher or superior. As much as to say, Who could bring about such a wonderful change as to make Saul a prophet? ( Ch.) but the Lord, whose *Spirit breatheth where he will.* Jo. 3:8. H.—Sept. “Who is his father? is it not Cis?” The Jews seem to have been in a like consternation, when they observed respecting Jesus, who wrought such miracles, Is not this the *carpenter’s son?* People are unwilling to reflect, that God can select his instruments and ministers from every profession, and make the tongues of infants eloquent. H.—The spirit of prophecy is a gift of God, not of parents. M.—But *a prophet is not without honour, save in his own country.* Mat. 13:57. H.  
**13** *Place.* Returning to his father’s house, after the Spirit had ceased to inspire him, and the prophets had retired home. His relations, suspecting something more than common had been revealed to Saul by Samuel, began to ask him questions: but he had the prudence to keep ( C.) his secret to himself, either in obedience to Samuel’s injunction, when he sent the servant before, ( H.) or out of humility, ( M.) or to prevent the dangers of envy from his own kindred. Josephus.  
**17** *Lord*, who always presided over such assemblies. This was convened to elect a king, whom God pointed out by lots. Some assert that the ark, and the high priest, in his pontifical ornaments, were present. C.—Adrichomius says Maspha was only three hours’ walk from Cariathiarim. M.  
**19** *Families.* Lots were first drawn to determine the tribe, then to find out which of the great families, and which house, was to give a king to Israel. H.—See Jos. 7:14. M.—God was pleased thus to convince them that the election proceeded from him. S. Greg. W.  
**21** *Metri* *.* We find none of this name, 1 Par. 8:1. It is probably a title which some of the great patriarchs of Benjamin had acquired by shooting, as Metri means “an archer or bowman.” C.  
**22** *Home.* Heb. “he hath hidden himself among the stuff,” ( H.) instruments, or baggage, at Masphath. He acted thus out of modesty, judging himself unfit for the exalted dignity, ( C.) and shewed that he did not seek for it. M.  
**23** *Upwards.* God condescended to gratify the desires of the people, who chiefly regarded the stature and corporal qualifications of their king. “Many nations are accustomed to look with veneration on a majestic person, and think none are capable of great exploits except those whom nature has made very handsome.” Curtius vi. See C. 9:2. More civilized nations rather consider the qualities of the mind. Alexander, Agesilaus, &c. were not of a majestic stature.  
**24** *King.* Our favourite song, “God save,” &c. is an amplification of this sentiment. H.  
**25** *Before the Lord.* It seems that the ark was therefore present. This record of Samuel is lost, so that we cannot determine what laws he prescribed on this occasion. C.—Josephus (vi. 5.) says that he wrote and read in the hearing of all, and in the presence of the king, what evils would ensue under the regal government; and deposited the writing in the tabernacle, that the truth of the prediction might be ascertained. He probably alludes to the denunciation of tyranny, which had been made C. 8. and which he says Samuel repeated on this occasion. But the prophet would also take a copy of *the law of the kingdom*, prescribed by Moses, (Deut. 17) and deliver it to Saul, that he might make it the rule of his conduct, and not imitate the wicked customs of tyrants. H.—The whole process of this memorable event he would also write down, ( M.) as we read it at present in this chapter, placing it in the proper order, as a continuation of the sacred history which Moses and Josue had commenced; and like them, depositing the sacred volume beside the ark, or in the tabernacle. See Jos. 24:26. H.  
**26** *Touched;* to consider the appointment of Saul, as his act. Afterwards they retired home, and the new king returned to his wonted occupations. The *army* here denotes part of the assembly, as the young men came with their leaders ready, if called, to march to battle. Ex. 6:26. Deut. 20:9. C.  
**27** Belial*;* seditious men, perhaps of the tribe of Ephraim, (Judg. 12) or of Juda, to whom the regal power seemed to belong. Gen. 49. Salien.—*Presents*, in testimony of their submission. See Judg. 3:15. 3 K. 4:21. The eastern kings still expect that ambassadors should bring noble presents, otherwise they deem themselves insulted. P. Martyr.—Subjects dare not appear before their king, in Thrace, without some such offering. Xenophon, Anab. vii. &c. C.—*Not.* He knew that the throne is established by mercy. Prov. 20:28. Hence he chose to pardon these discontented people after he had obtained the victory, and was even solicited to make an example of them. Salien, A. 2962.—Severity might have alienated the minds of many, as he was hardly yet confirmed in his dignity, and the war against Ammon was threatening. M.

## Chapter 11

**1** *After this.* So far is omitted in the Heb. &c. but we find it in most editions of the Sept. and in Josephus. C.—*Fight.* He had threatened an invasion before, and had perhaps ( H.) attacked some of the tribes on the east side of the Jordan, and treated them with the same cruelty as he intended for those of Jabes, which was a city of the first consequence. Josephus, vi. 5.—*Naas*, “a serpent.” There was a king of this country of the same name, in the days of David. The people had been quiet since Jephte had made such havoc among them, about ninety years before. Judg. 11. C.—*Covenan* *t.* They were willing to pay him tribute. But it seems they had offered him some insult, which made the king resolve to punish them more severely. They make no mention of Saul, as they did not wish to let the king know of his election; (Salien) and perhaps had no great confidence in him, ( H.) as he was not yet fully confirmed in his dignity, ( C.) and had let a whole month pass without taking any measures for the deliverance of his country, though it was on that pretext that he was elected. H.—They considered what had passed as of no consequence. C. 12:12.  
**2** *Eyes:* strange proposal! He would not render them quite blind, that he might not be deprived of their service. But he wished to render them unfit for war, ( C.) as the buckler covers the left eye; (Josephus) and people who shoot with bow and arrow, keep it closed. C.  
**3** *Days.* We have examples of similar requests in history. Grot. Jur. iii. 23. See Judith 7:23.  
**4** *Of Saul.* Sept. “to Saul,” which may remove the surprise of Abulensis, that the king is not mentioned. Salien.—Saul was absent at the time, so that they made known the threatening danger to the people.  
**5** *Field.* So David fed sheep, even after he was anointed king. The ancients had very different sentiments of royalty from what we have. Their kings and great men did not esteem it beneath them to cultivate the earth. Several of them wrote on the subject.  
**6** *Spirit* of fortitude, prudence, and zeal. H.  
**7** *Oxen*, with which he had been ploughing.—*Pieces* *.* Heb. does not say that he sent *them;* and Josephus intimates, that he only “hamstrung them, and sent messengers,” &c. H.—But such actions are far more impressive than words. See Judg. 19:29. Act. 21:10. &c. C.—*Samuel.* Saul adds the name of the prophet, as the people had still great confidence in him, and he always acted as God’s envoy. H.—*Oxen.* He does not threaten capital punishment, but insinuates that both duty and interest require the presence of all. Salien.—*Of the Lord;* that is, a great fear: ( C.) or, God moved the people to shew a ready obedience and reverence to their king’s commands.  
**8** *Bezec*, where Adonibezec had reigned, (Judg. 1. M.) near the place where they crossed the Jordan, a little below Scythopolis, to go to Jabes, which was about thirty miles distant. C.—*Thousand.* Josephus makes the army consist of 770,000, who were collected at Bala. Sept. have 600,000 of Israel; and they agree with this author, in allowing also 70,000 to Juda alone. But this is a larger army than what came out of Egypt, and exceeds the limits of probability, unless *all* assembled, as the preceding verse seems ( H.) to insinuate; ( M.) and we find far greater numbers, 2 Par. 13:3, 17, if no ( H.) error have there crept in. Kennicott.  
**9** *Hot.* Josephus says, Saul “being seized with the divine spirit, ordered them to inform the citizens of Jabes, that he would come to their assistance on the third day, and rout the enemy before the sun arose.” But the message of which the Scripture here speaks, ( H.) was sent from Bezec. Saul, in effect, came upon the Ammonites unawares before it was light, gained a complete victory, ( C.) and then pursued the fugitives till noon.  
**10** *To you*, Naas, ( H.) which they speak in irony, and that the enemy may be off his guard. C.—We must thus deceive our passions, that we may not be blinded ( H.) or slain by them. S. Greg. v. 1. in Reg. W.  
**11** *Camp.* It was not then customary to throw up any fortifications, but only to place sentinels in all the avenues.—*Watch*, which ended at sunrise. C.  
**12** *Them.* It seems there were but few discontented persons. Salien.—They address themselves to *Samuel*, who they knew had not regarded their request of a king with approbation, as if to give him a little mortification. But he makes a proposal of confirming the election with still greater solemnity, if they persevered in their resolution, ( H.) as he intimated they might still recede, ( C.) and be content with the former mode of government, as being far better. H.  
**15** *They made.* Sept. “and there (again the prophet; Josephus) Samuel anointed Saul king.” The same ceremonies as had been used before, except the casting of lots, were here repeated, particularly the solemn anointing, (Salien) whence, in the following chapter, (5:3) Saul is styled *the anointed.* M.—*The Lord.* His ark was probably present, and the priests to offer victims. Salien, A. 2963.

## Chapter 12

**1** *You.* He speaks with the authority of a prophet, ( C.) and takes this opportunity to draw from the whole people a confession of his integrity, that the kings might follow the pattern which he had set them. H.  
**2** *Goeth*, as your leader, according to your request. I am like a private man, ( C.) willing to submit to his and the people’s judgment, ( H.) though it could not be required. M.—*Grey-headed.* This he might be at the age of sixty, which most chronologers allow him, ( H.) as he had been at the head of affairs from his early years, in most difficult times. T.—*With you.* As soon as I heard of your complaints, I deprived them of their power, so that you cannot blame me from their misconduct. If they were guilty, they may stand their trial before the king. C.  
**3** *Anoint* *ed*, “Christ,” as the anointing of kings prefigured that of the *Messias*, which, in Hebrew, has the same import as the word χριστος has in Greek. C.—*Wronged.* Lit. “by calumny,” or by any other mode of oppression. H.—*Despise.* Heb. “hide my eyes,” through confusion. C.—Prot. “to blind my eyes therewith.” H.—Sept. have read nalim, “shoes,” instead of anlim. C.—“Have I taken from the hand of any one a preset, to render me favourable, so much as a shoe? (upodema, or latchet) answer against me,” &c. H.  
**6** *Made*, and appointed them to rule the people. Jerem. 37:15. Le Clerc.—*Egypt.* Sept. add, “is witness;” and some Latin copies have, “is present.” C.  
**7** *Stand up*, like people cited to the bar. Having undergone his own trial with applause, Samuel shews that the people will not come off so well at the tribunal of God, whom they had treated with greater disrespect, injustice, and ingratitude than they had himself, as he convinced them by an astonishing and terrible storm. H.—*Kindness.* Sept. “justice,” as the same Heb. word implies both. God had treated his people with mercy and with justice ( C.) alternately. H.  
**9** *Hasor.* See Judg. 4:1.—*Moab.* Jephte delivered the people from the hands of the Ammonites, who claimed all that country. Judg. 11:15. Eglon had been slain by Aod, before the Chanaanites enslaved Israel. C.  
**11** *Jerobaal and Badan* *.* That is, Gedeon and Samson, called here Badan or Bedan, because he was of Dan. Ch. Chald. &c. W.—Others think that Jair, (Judg. 10:3. Junius, Usher,) or, according to the Sept. “Barac,” are designated. Jair was a descendant of one Bedan, 1 Par. 2:21. C.—But we do not read that Jair performed any great exploit. H.—*Samuel.* He speaks of himself as of any other man: as the interests of God were not to be betrayed by an unseasonable modesty. C.—Josephus only specifies Jephte and Gedeon. H.—The Israelites thought that they could dispose things better than God had done under the judges; and hence their sin is so often repeated. S. Greg. W.  
**13** *Desired.* S. Aug. (in Ps. li.) considers this as a kind of sarcasm. C.—You will see what advantages you will derive from your choice. M.  
**14** *Of the Lord*, causing him to look upon you and treat you with indignation. C.—Sept. “and do not contend with the mouth,” or against the orders of the Lord, which cannot fail to excite his displeasure. M.—If you prove faithful under this new form of government, though it be less agreeable to God, he will still protect you. H.  
**15** *Fathers.* Sept. “king,” v. 25. Superiors ( W.) are often styled fathers. Syr. &c. “as upon your fathers,” ( C.) which is adopted by the Prot. “as *it was* against,” &c. H.  
**17** Wheat-harvest. At which time of the year it never thunders or rains in those countries. Ch.—The wheat-harvest is towards the end of June. The usual seasons for rain are only spring and autumn. S. Jerom in Amos iv. 7, &c.—*Thunder.* Lit. “voices.” Ps. 17:14. C.—*See.* Being fully convinced by the miracle, which declares the will of God in the clearest manner. Though God was pleased thus to manifest his displeasure, at the people’s assuming to themselves the right of changing the established form of government, by insisting so much upon having a king at this time, we cannot hence infer, as Paine and some late seditious writers have done, that the regal power is in itself an evil. It might be contrary to a theocracy, and still might suit the manners of some nations better than any other form. To determine precisely what sort of government is best, would be an arduous task. We admire our own constitution; yet our ally, the prince of the Brazils, has lately forbidden any panegyric of it to be printed in his dominions. All innovations are, generally, attended with the most serious inconveniences. H.  
**19** *And Samuel*, at whose prayer the Lord had sent such a storm, lest he should punish them as they deserved. But the prophet alleviates their fears, and teaches them to refrain from idolatry, and he will still continue to perform his duty in praying for them, and giving them good advice. Salien.—The fear of God is increased by that which the people shew for his servants.  
**20** *Following*, as that would imply despair. To come boldly before him would argue presumption. Therefore, S. Mary Magdalene keeps at the feet of Jesus Christ. W.  
**21** *Vain* and wicked idols. Heb. thohu, full of “confusion” and disorder.  
**22** *Sake.* This motive often proved the salvation of Israel. Ex. 32:12. The Scriptures wholly tend to impress upon our minds, a sense of our own weakness, and of God’s infinite glory and perfection. C.—We may all say, “Our hope to rise is all from Thee—our ruin’s all our own.” Austin.  
**23** *The Lord.* For a pastor to neglect instruction, is not only detrimental to the people, but injurious to God. H.—*Way.* None contributed more than Samuel to keep the people within due bounds, during the reign of Saul. C.  
**25** *Together.* Sept. “shall be rejected.” Saul soon experienced the effect of this prophetic menace; and the Jews were, at last, also cast away. H.

## Chapter 13

**1** *Of one year.* That is, he was good, and like an innocent child, and for two years continued in that innocency. Ch. S. Greg. W.—*Israel.* This verse is omitted in some copies of the Sept. It is extremely difficult to explain. Some translate Heb. “Saul was a son of one year old,” &c. Sym. Others, “Saul begot a son the first year of his reign, (Raban) Isboseth, who was 40 years old when his father died, after governing all that while. Serar.—Syr. and Arab. “In the first or second year of the reign of Saul … he chose,” &c. Hardouin supposes that the people dated their years by his reign only so long. Some think that the Heb. is imperfect; and an ancient interpreter has, “Saul was 30 years old, when he began,” &c. C.—The Rabbins and may commentators assert, that the reign of Saul lasted only two years. T.—But some of them explain this, as if he reigned alone only that term before he was rejected, when he could only be regarded as an usurper. Others, that he obtained the whole power for two years, after the death of Samuel. Usher concludes that, during the incursions of the Philistines, he could hardly be said to reign, and these commenced after he had been king two years. We might also translate, “Saul was the son of the year of his reign, (when he was confirmed at Galgal) and in the second year … he chose,” &c. C.—Perhaps the first translation, though somewhat mystical, may be the most literal, shewing that for one year Saul continued to act with the most engaging affability and moderation. But in the second he threw off the yoke, and was, in his turn, rejected by the Lord, as we shall soon behold. H.—Scaliger seems to prefer allowing that the numeral letters have been omitted by some transcriber, and that we should read, Saul was 30 years old. This, and similar variations, he attributes to the compendious method of using numeral letters; (Kennicott) an inconvenience very frequently attending all MSS. both sacred and profane. Taylor.  
**2** *Dwellings*, from Galgal (Salien) or from some other general assembly. C.—These 3000 were to be the king’s guards, supported at the expense of the nation, that the people might begin to feel one part of the royal prerogative. Salien, A.C. 1089.  
**3** *Land.* As soon as the next cities had heard the alarm, they sounded the trumpet, and so the news was conveyed to the most distant parts, in a short time. Judg. 3:27.—*Hebrews.* Probably those “on the other side” of the Jordan, who presently came to the assistance of their brethren, v. 7. Osiander.—It might also be the usual beginning of a proclamation. See Dan. 3:4. M.—Sept. and Aquila have *a* instead of *r*, in *hibrim.* “Let the servants (subjects) attend.” Aq. The slaves have rebelled,” (Sept.) meaning the Philistines, who ought to have been subject to Israel. H.  
**4** *Courage.* Heb. “and Israel was in abomination (stinking) with the Philistines.” See Ex. 6:21. C.—Sept. “despised as nothing the strangers.”—*Were* should be omitted, as the verb is active, *cl* *amavit*, in the Vulg. and Sept. though the Prot. have “were called,” &c. They shouted with alacrity, that Saul would lead them on to battle. H.—Osiander thinks that they “exclaimed against him,” for engaging them in this new war.  
**5** *Chariots.* This number seems almost incredible, as the Philistines were but a contemptible nation, compared with various others which never brought so many chariots into the field. Zara, king of Ethiopia, in his army of a million men, had only 300. 2 Par. 14:9. Adarezer had 1000, and Sesac 12000 chariots, while Solomon could only boast of 1400. Hence the Syr. and Arab. read “3000;” and it is supposed that the Heb. has im, at the end of shelosh, redundant. Bochart, Capel, &c. The number of horsemen would otherwise bear no proportion with the chariots. We must also observe, that under this name the Scripture denotes those who upon the chariots. They were drawn by two horses, and one man guided the horses, while another stood on the chariot; and in battle, eight other soldiers attended it. These remarks will tend to explain many difficult passages, in which we read of chariots being slain and hamstrung, which may be understood of the men and horses, 2 K. 8:4 and 10:18. In one place we read 700, and in another 7000 chariot were slain, (1 Par. 19:18,) the latter number comprising the 10 attendants; so here, the Philistines might have 3000 chariots, which being each accompanied with ten men, might be counted as 30,000. C.—Others think that there were 30,000 men fighting on chariots. Lyran. Salien.—The Tyrians might have come to the assistance of their old friends, as C. 7:10. See 3 K. 4:26. M.—*Number.* Josephus specifies “300,000 infantry.” H.—*Bethaven* *.* Many copies of the Sept. read, “Bethoron,” more probably, as Bethel must have been on the east of Machmas, which lay north of Gabaa, chap 14:5. ( C.) “over-against Bethoron on the south.” Grabe. H.—Heb. also, “having Bethaven on the east.” Bethel was called Bethaven after the schism of Jeroboam, so that this name seems to have been substituted by a later writer, ( C.) unless it might have had both names long before. Jos. 18:12. H.—this is not contrary to C. 7:13, as the Philistines had been quiet for a long time. Heb. alom, properly denotes the term of a jubilee or 50 years. D.  
**6** *Straitened*, the people from the northern provinces, and provisions being cut off, by the immense army of the Philistines. C.—Providence was pleased to convince the people that, though they had been able to muster so large a force against the Ammonites, at so short a warning, they must not depend on the efforts of their new king. H.—He suffered any of the army to retire, as he sent away most of Gedeon’s soldiers, that the whole glory of the victory might be attributed to him. Salien.—*Dens.* So the Chal. Some explain the Heb. “high places ( H.) or towers.” C.—Sept. “ditches or holes.” M.—Βοθροις. In that country there are many spacious caverns. C. 24. Jos. 10. H.  
**7** *Hebrews.* Sept. “the people, who came over, (the river) crossed the Jordan.” H.—The title of Hebrews, “passengers,” seems to be applied to those who lived on the east side of the river, ( C.) though probably some others would seek for a retreat in that country, or even hide themselves in the regions of the Ammonites, out of which they had lately driven the inhabitants. H.—Heb. “the Hebrews passed over the Jordan, the land of,” &c. C.—*Afraid.* Sept. in a sort of “ecstasy” of fear.  
**8** *Of Samuel.* Yet the prophet condemns his proceedings, either because he did not wait till the expiration of the seventh day, ( C. S. Ignatius, &c. Salien) or because he ventured to offer sacrifice himself. Lyra. after Sulp. Serverus, &c. H. W.—He had however the high priest with him; (C. 14:3,) so that he might have performed this sacred function, at the request of Saul: and we do not find that the latter is accused of sacrilege. Salien.—The magnitude of the punishment is no proof of the nature of the transgression, as God often punishes, with great severity, sins which to us might appear venial. H.—This is true, particularly with respect to those who first dare to transgress a positive command; (Num. 15:32. M.) as Saul seems to have done the injunction of the prophet, C. 10:8. The regal dignity was a gratuitous gift. Salien.—With a trembling heart, we must consider how he was rejected for neglecting to wait so short a time,” (S. Greg.) when the circumstances seems to plead so strongly in his favour. How impenetrable are the judgments of God! and how punctually does he require his orders to be obeyed! C.  
**12** *Lord*, by sacrifices.—*Holocaust.* Heb. “I forced myself therefore,” &c. It is asked whether Saul offered sacrifice, or caused it to be offered by the priests. The text seems to assert that he did it himself. Samuel and David did the like; and we read that Solomon ascended to the brazen altar, at Gabaon, for the same purpose. 2 Par. 1:5. If it was lawful to erect altars out of the tabernacle, notwithstanding the divine prohibition, why might not individuals also offer sacrifice on certain solemn occasions? The Hebrew kings seem to have exercised some of the sacerdotal functions, particularly before the building of the temple; for afterwards we find one of their kings severely punished for presuming to offer incense. 4 K. 15:5. C.—Yet the proofs that they ever lawfully offered sacrifice, are not very satisfactory, as, in the Scripture language, a person is often said to do what he enjoins another to perform on his account; and if some prophets have acted in the character of priests, by divine dispensation, we need not extend the privilege to all who have dared to assume the like prerogative. The law is clear. It is the duty of all who do not regulate their conduct by it, to know that they have God’s approbation. Their expressing no scruple on the occasion, proves nothing, no more than the sacred writer’s omitting to stigmatize their proceedings. But here, if Saul really offered the holocaust, the words of Samuel, *Thou hast done foolishly*, convey a sufficient reproach: but if he did not, we must suppose that he blames the neglect of waiting the full term of days. H.  
**13** *Ever.* He foresaw this want of obedience, and therefore promised the sceptre to Juda. Gen. 49. M.—God’s foresight of sin, and preordination to punish it, does not take away free-will nor the possibility of a reward. S. Aug. W.  
**14** *Continue* long. This seems to have been a threat, which Saul might still have escaped, if he had not proved disobedient again. S. Greg. says, “he might have been loosed from the bonds of his former disobedience;” *prioris inobedientiæ nexus enodaret* *.* The second rebellion caused him to be entirely rejected, and the prophet was ordered to go and anoint David. C. 15. Salien.  
**15** **Ve** **r.** **15** **.** *Samuel.* Piscator suspects that we ought to read *Saul*, as no mention is made of the prophet in the sequel of this war, and he is never consulted. C.—Josephus says he returned home. H.—But all the versions are conformable to the text: and Samuel went with the king and his 600 soldiers, to Gabaa, ( C.) that he might not appear to retain any ill-will towards Saul, and that his followers might not be quite dispirited, as they knew that he had the thunderbolts of heaven in his hand; and if he was with them, they had nothing to fear from the myriads of their opponents. His presence was very seasonable, for they had to cut their way through the enemy. Salien.—*And the … Benjamin.* All this is omitted in Heb. Chal. and in many Greek and Latin copies. C.—It is found in the Alex. and Vat. Sept.—*I* *n the hill*, is a translation of Gabaa, which alone occurs in those editions. H.  
**17** *Plunder*, seeing that the Israelites durst not come to an engagement. Jonathan took advantage of their absence. C. 14.—*Land of Sual*, “foxes,” not far from the birth-place of Gedeon. Judges 6:11.  
**18** *Bethoron*, the lower, to the north-west of Gabaa.—*Seboim* was one of the cities which perished along with Sodom. C.  
**19** *Smith.* The Philistines had taken these precautions before Samuel gained the victory over them, and he consented that the people should employ the Philistines as before, when he made peace with them; (Salien) or they had again begun to get the upper hand at the beginning of Saul’s reign, as the Israelites had been long in the enjoyment of peace, and negligent. T.—Josephus extends this species of servitude only to the neighbourhood of Gabaa, and says the major part of Saul’s 600 men “was destitute of arms, because that country had neither iron nor people to make arms.” The immense army which had so lately discomfited the Ammonites, was surely not without weapons. But most of them had retired, ( H.) and those who accompanied the king might rely chiefly on their expertness in using the sling. Judg. 20:16. M.—The brave men who came to join David, are praised on this account, as well as for shooting with bow and arrow. 1 Par. 12:2. Furious battles have been also fought with sharpened stakes, burnt at the end, (Æn. vii.) and with various implements of husbandry, of which the Hebrews were not deprived. In the defeat of Sisara, they had not a buckler nor a lance among 40,000 (Judg. 5:8. C.) as the Philistines had already begun to deprive the Israelites of such weapons. H.—Other nations have since imitated their policy. 4 K. 24:14. Justin. i. 7.  
**20** *All Israel*, whom the Philistines had conquered, particularly the neighbouring tribes. C.—They were obliged to go to the places where the enemy kept garrisons, ( M.) as they did at Gabaa, Bethel, &c.—*Share.* Sept. Syr. &c. “scythe,” or “sickle for corn;” θεριστηριον. H.—The original term, macharesha, may signify all sorts of implements.—*Spade.* Heb. is supposed to mean, “a coulter.” Sept. “instrument,” which the prophets often say will be turned into a sword, in times of war. Joel 3:15. Mic. 4:3.—*Rake.* The same generical term is used in Heb. as was before translated *a plough-share.* Sept. have “scythe;” δρεπανον. C.  
**21** *Mended*, by the Philistines. H.—The Heb. is variously translated. “Their implements were like saws; *or*, they had a file to sharpen the,” &c. C.—Sept. “and the fruits were ready to be gathered. But the vessels (instruments for labour) were three sicles for a tooth, and the same price (or station, υποστασις, a word used v. 23, in the latter sense) for an axe or a scythe;” as if the Philistines required three sicles for doing the smallest thing, when the harvest was at hand. H.  
**23** *Further.* Heb. “went out to the passage ( H.) *or* defile of Machmas,” leading to Gabaa. C.—Sept. “and there came out of the station of the strangers, to the other side (or beyond) Machmas,” where they have been fixed. C. 6:11, 16. H.

## Chapter 14

**1** *Day*, while it was yet dark. Josephus.—This action would seem rash, and contrary to military discipline, which requires that the general should be apprised of any hazardous enterprise. C.—But it is thought that Jonathan was directed by God, who granted him success. A. Lapide.—The Rabbins say, “every augury which is not like that of Eleazar and Jonathan, is null. If they had done ill, … God would not have heard them.” Kimchi.  
**2** *Magron*, a village between Gabaa and Machmas. Isai. 10:28. Heb. reads “Remmon,” which means “a pomegranate tree,” and denotes a famous impregnable rock, with extensive caverns, where an equal number of men had formerly saved themselves. Judg. 20:47. C. T. M.  
**3** *Ephod;* or was high priest, v. 18. Achias is called Achimelech, C. 22:9. C.—He had succeeded his father, Achitob, in the beginning of Saul’s reign, after the former had held the dignity twenty-two years. Salien, A. 2962.  
**6** *Uncircumcised.* The Hebrews looked upon the Gentiles as unclean and they, in their turn, spoke of the Jews in the most contemptuous manner. C.—*It may.* Lit. “if perchance.” H.—This does not express any doubt. The hero found himself impelled to undertake this work, but he knew not by what means God would crown it with success. He therefore prays to him in this manner, as Abraham’s servant had done. Gen. 24:12. He does not tempt God no more than Gedeon and Moses, who begged that the Lord would manifest his will by miracles. C.—*Few.* These words are often repeated, (2 Par. 14:11. 1 Mac. 3:18,) and were verified. C. 17:47. Judg. 7:4. M.  
**10** *This* *shall be a sign.* It is likely Jonathan was instructed by divine inspiration, to make choice of this sign; otherwise, the observation of *omens* is superstitious and sinful. Ch. M. W.  
**11** *Philistin* *es*, probably on the northern rock, as they afterwards climbed up that on the south, ( C.) where they had not been discovered. Salien.  
**12** *A thing*, making you pay dear for this temerity. Herodotus (v.) mentions, that the Peonians were commanded by the oracle not to attack the Perinthians, unless they were challenged. They did so, and gained a complete victory.  
**14** *Day.* Varro, &c. allow 120 feet, Columella only 70, for a day’s work, so that these twenty men were slain in the space of 60 or 35 feet. Louis de Dieu rejects all the other versions, and would translate the Heb. “in almost the half of the length of a furrow, and in the breadth which is between two furrows in a field,” so that the enemy would be very close together. Lit. “almost in the half of a furrow of a yoke of the field,” which seems rather to be understood of the length, ( C.) if indeed it have any meaning. Prot. are forced to help out the text: “within as it were a half acre of land, *which* a yoke *of oxen might plo* *ugh.*” H.—But a whole acre was the usual allowance. M.—Hallet observes, “the Sept. read the Heb. in a different manner, and have rendered the verse thus, ‘That first slaughter was … of about twenty men, with darts, and stones, and flints of the field:’ I suppose the read, Betsim ubomauth*.”* Kennicott adds, and ubgomri, as the Arabs still use gomer, to denote “a small flint.” Golius. H.  
**15** *Mira* *cle.* Heb. charada, “consternation *or* trembling,” a panic fear, as the Philistines imagined that all the army of Israel had got into the camp. “In the terrors sent by demons, (*or* superior beings) even the sons of the gods flee away.” Pindar. Nem. The earth quaked ( C.) to increase the enemies’ apprehensions, so that those who had gone out to plunder, hearing of the disaster, which report had greatly magnified, and all the people feeling this unusual and alarming motion of the earth, perceiving that God was fighting against them, and trembled. H.  
**16** *Gabaa*, where they were stationed to observe the enemies’ motions, and to give notice of them to Saul, at Remmon, v. 2. C.—*Overthrown.* Heb. “melted down, (without courage) and they went crushing” one another is the narrow passes, ( H.) and turning their arms against all they met. Josephus.  
**17** *Were not.* Heb. “when they had numbered, behold Jonathan, &c. not” in the number. H.  
**18** *Ark.* Sept. “the ephod.” Kimchi, &c.—Spencer follows the sentiment of the Rabbins, and explains it of a little box, in which the ephod and pectoral were placed, when they were brought to the army. But what need of this explication? C.—How the oracle was given is uncertain. M.  
**19** *Hand.* He prayed with his hands extended. Saul believed that God had sufficiently intimated his will, by affording such a favourable opportunity. “The best of omens is to revenge our country’s wrongs.” Hector. Iliad. M.—*Optimis auspiciis ea geri, quæ pro Reip. salute fierent*, was the observation of Q. F. Maximus. Senect. C.—Saul did not wait for God’s answer, and therefore had nearly lost his son by a rash vow, and by too eager zeal. W.  
**21** *Before;* that is, for some time, as slaves. M.—Having retired to their *camp*, to avoid the plunderers, ( C.) they rose upon their oppressors, as Christian slaves have often done upon the Turks, when a galley has been engaged, and fallen into the hands of their friends. M.—*Camp.* Heb. adds, “round about,” as if they guarded the baggage, (Piscator) or had retreated thither from the environs. C.  
**22** *And there*, &c. This is not found in Heb. &c. nor in many Latin copies. The Sept. specify the number, (v. 24) where it is not in the original. C.  
**23** *Bethaven* *.* They pursued the stragglers thither, as well as to Aialon, v. 31. H.  
**24** *Together.* Which interpretation is more natural ( C.) than the Prot. “where distressed, … for Saul had adjured,” &c. H.—Sept. “And all the people was with Saul, about 10,000, and the war was spread through all the city in Mount Ephraim, and Saul was guilty of great ignorance that day, and he adjures ( H. *or* cursed) the people,” &c. He saw not that he was acting against his own interest. The sequel does not evince that God approved of his conduct. But the people were to be taught not to make light of oaths, nor to neglect the curses which their rulers should denounce. C.—*Food.* Lit. “bread,” which comprises all sorts of food, honey, &c. (v. 25. H.) but not drink, which might lawfully have been taken, as thirst is more difficult to bear. M.—Salien ( A. 2964) defends the conduct of Saul, and condemns Jonathan.  
**25** *Ground.* Even still travellers perceived the smell of honey very frequently in that country. Maundrell.—The people use honey almost in every sauce and in every repast. Virgil assures us, that “bees dwell in holes under ground, in hollow stones, and trees.” Georg. iv. The Scripture frequently mentions honey flowing. Ex. 2:8. Ps. 70:17. Job 20:17.  
**27** *Enlightened.* Extreme hunger and fatigue hurt the eyes. Jer. 14:6. Sanctius saw a man who through fasting lost his sight, and recovered it again as soon as he had eaten. This is conformable to the observations of Hippocrates, and to nature. C.—*Tenebræ oboriuntur, genua inedia succedunt. Perii, prospicio parum* *.* “Through hunger … I see but little.” Plautus. H.  
**29** *Land.* Chal. “the people of the land.” M.—He speaks his sentiments freely. But we ought not to find fault, in public, with the conduct of the prince. C.—The people might have eaten a little without stopping the pursuit, as they generally carried provisions with them, or might find some easily on the road, so as to run with fresh vigour, (See Jos. 10) and make ample amends for the time that they were delayed. H.  
**31** *Aialon*, in the tribe of Dan. It might be about ten miles from Machmas.  
**32** *Blood*, contrary to a two-fold law. Gen. 9:4. Lev. 17:14. The blood ought to have been carefully extracted and buried. C.—This was another bad effect of Saul’s rash oath. W.  
**34** *With the blood*, as you have done. M.  
**35** *First.* Saul begins to exercise himself in acts of religion, which only belonged to a prophet, &c. He thought he might do so in quality of king, thus consecrating a monument of his victory to the God of armies. It was perhaps the very stone on which the oxen had been just before killed for the people. C.  
**36** *God*, to consult him, whether the enterprise met with his approbation. Saul is too eager to follow his own prudence. H.—He would not before wait for God’s answer; (v. 19) now he can get none. W.  
**38** *Corners*, to the very last; or all the princes. Judg. 18:9.  
**39** *Gainsayed him*, out of respect. Saul gives another proof of his precipitation, in swearing; and the people, by this silence, acquiesce, not suspecting that Jonathan could have offended in what he had done. C.—One of them, at least, knew that he had transgressed the order of his father, v. 28. But extreme necessity might plead his excuse. H.—They might be silent through fear, or reverence, without giving their consent. Salien.  
**41** *A sign*, (judicium;) “pass sentence;” declare why, &c. H.—Heb. “give purity.” Shew who is innocent. C.—Sept. “give the proofs” by the Thummim, which they seem to have read. C.  
**42** *Jonathan was taken.* Though Jonathan was excused from sin, through ignorance of the prohibition, yet God was pleased on this occasion to let the lot fall upon him, to shew to all, the great obligation of obedience to princes and parents, ( Ch.) the sacred nature of an oath, and at the same time to give Saul a warning not to swear rashly. C.—How must he have been afflicted, when he saw that he had brought his beloved son into such danger! M.  
**44** *Die.* We may here admire the respect which the ancients had for an oath, without seeking for any modification; and the blindness of Saul, who condemns his son with as much haste as he had pronounced the curse, thinking thus to honour God. The thing surely required some deliberation, and he ought to have consulted the Lord about it. The action of Jonathan was not criminal, and the former silence of God did not prove that he deserved death. C.—If it had, the people would never have been able to have rescued him, no more than the unhappy Achan. Jos. 7. H.—If Saul had been more enlightened, and more humble, he would have concluded that God was displeased at him, and not at Jonathan. C.—Yet Cajetan and Serarius find fault with the latter. M.  
**45** *The people*, directed probably by the high priest, who pronounced the oath null. Salien.—*Ground.* He shall not be hurt. M.—*With Go* *d.* He has been visibly “the minister of God’s mercy.” Sept.—*Die.* They obtained his pardon. They ought not to have permitted the king’s oath to be put in execution, as it was so horribly unjust. Grot. Jur. ii. 13. 6. C.  
**47** *Soba*, in the north. M.—Rohab was the capital of another part of Cœlosyria. 1 Par. 18:3. 2 K. 10:6.—*Overcame.* We are not to judge of the virtue of a man from his success in the world. C.—Under the reign of Saul, the tribe of Ruben overcame the Agarites. 1 Par. 5:10, 18. Salien, A. 2965.  
**48** *Amalec* *.* The particulars of this war will be given C. 15. as it explains the cause of Saul’s rejection, and David’s advancement to the throne. Salien.  
**49** *Sons*, who accompanied Saul in his wars. Isboseth was too young.—*Jessui* is called Abinadab, 1 Par. 8:33. C.  
**50** *A* *chinoam.* After he came to the throne, he had Respha. 2 K. 3:7. M.

## Chapter 15

**1** *Lord*, in gratitude for so great an honour. H.  
**2** *Reckoned up.* God speaks in a human manner, as if he had been reading the history of ancient times. Ex. 17:14. M.—The Amalecites had treated Israel with inhumanity, above 400 years before. God’s vengeance is often slow, but only so much the more terrible. C.—Heb. pakadti, I have visited, or will punish and remember.  
**3** *De* *stroy*, as a thing accursed. H.—*Child.* The great master of life and death (who cuts off one half of mankind whilst they are children) has been pleased sometimes to ordain that children should be put to the sword, in detestation of the crimes of their parents, and that they might not live to follow the same wicked ways. But without such ordinance of God, it is not allowable in any wars, how just soever, to kill children. Ch.—The Israelites were now to execute God’s orders with blind obedience, as he cannot be guilty of injustice.—*Nor covet … his*, is omitted in Heb. &c. C.—Amalec is stricken when the flesh is chastised—He is destroyed when we repress evil thoughts. S. Greg. W.  
**4** *As lambs.* This comparison is very common. Isai. 40:11. Ezec. 34:2. But many translate the Heb. “in Telaim.” S. Jerom reads Heb. c, *as*, instead of b, *in*, with greater propriety. Sept. and Josephus, “in Galgal,” which in effect would have been the most proper place for rendezvous. C.—*Footmen.* Vat. Sept. “400,000 ranks *or* standards, (Josephus, men) and Juda 30,000.”  
**5** *Amelac.* The people dwelt in tents, and removed from one place to another. So in Ethiopia there are properly no cities, the place where the prince encamps is deemed the capital. C.—*Torrent.* Heb. or “valley.”  
**6** *Egypt.* See Judg. 1:16. Ex. 18:12. Num. 10:31 and 24:21. Saul gave private instructions to the Cinite, who had been settled at Arad, and had mixed with Amalec, to depart. C.  
**7** *Sur.* See Gen. 2:11 and 16:7 and 25:18. Ex. 15:22. M.—These people had occupied a great part of the country, from the Persian Gulf to Egypt. H.  
**9** *Garments.* Heb. is commonly rendered, “fatlings.” Sept. “eatables.” C.—Avarice seems to have actuated Saul, (Lyran) or a false pity, (Josephus) or a desire to grace his triumph, v. 12. Glossa. M.  
**11** *Repenteth.* God cannot change: but he often acts exteriorly as one who repents. He alters his conduct when men prove rebellious. S. Justin. p. 22.—*Grieved.* Heb. “indignant.” C.—He was sorry to think that Saul would now lose his temporal, and perhaps his eternal crown. Salien.—“The choice of Judas and of Saul, do not prove that God is ignorant of future events, but rather that he is a Judge of the present.” S. Jer. in Ezec. ii.  
**12** *Arch.* Here we behold what a change prosperity makes in the manners of those who before shewed the greatest humility. Saul erects a monument to his own vanity. Heb. “he has set him up a hand,” (as Absalom did, 2 K. 18:18) or “a place” to divide the booty, (Jonathan) or “a garrison,” to keep the country in subjection. C.—Perhaps he erected the figure of “a hand,” as an emblem of strength, and in honour of Benjamin, “the son of the right hand,” of whose tribe he was. H.  
**14** *Hear*, and which manifestly prove, that God’s order has not been put in execution. M.  
**15** *Thy God.* This was probably a falsehood, like the rest. Salien.  
**17** *Eyes.* God rejects the proud, and *gives* his *grace to the humble.* See Luke 1:52. H.  
**20** *Lord.* Sept. “of the people.”  
**21** *First-fruits*, or the best.—*Slain.* Heb. “of the anathema.”  
**22** *Rams.* Can God be pleased with victims which he has cursed? H.  
**23** *Obey.* Heb. “Rebellion is the sin of divination *or* witchcraft, and resistance is iniquity, and the Theraphim.” Sym. “the injustice of idols.” Theraphim here designate idolatrous representations. Gen. 31:19. They were probably of Chaldee origin, in honour of the sun and fire, ( C.) and were venerated like the Penates, and supposed to be the sources of prosperity, from the Arab. Taraph, “to give abundance.” Hence Laban was so solicitous to recover what Rachel had taken away. Louis de Dieu—By sacrifices we give our goods, or another’s flesh is immolated; (Mor. xxxiii. 10. D.) by obedience, we give ourselves to God. S. Greg. W.  
**24** **V** **er.** **24** **.** *Voice:* miserable excuse for a king, who ought to prevent the sins of his people! C.—Saul’s transgression seems less than David’s; but the one repents, and the other proudly defends what he had done. D.  
**25** *Bear*, or take away. Pardon my fault. Do not expose me in public.—*The Lord*, by offering sacrifices, v. 31. C.  
**27** *Rent:* a dreadful prognostic that Saul was cast away. H.  
**29** *Triumpher.* Some suppose that he speaks ironically of Saul. A prince, like you, will not repent. C.—But it more probably refers to God, who would not fail to execute his threats against the king. H.—Heb. “the victor in Israel will not lie, he will not repent.” Sept. “and Israel shall be split in two, and the holy one of Israel shall not turn nor repent.” Saul’s rejection became now inevitable.  
**30** *Israel.* He is wholly solicitous to shun disgrace in this world. H.—His confession was not actuated by such contrition as that he might deserve to hear, *the Lord has removed thy sin.* He begins by falsehood; continues making idle excuses, and throwing the blame on others, and concludes, by shewing that he is more concerned for what his subjects may think and do against him, than for the displeasure of God. He boldly ventures to offer victims. But Samuel joins not with him in prayer, looking upon him as a person excommunicated; and he only attends that he may see the word of the Lord fulfilled, and Agag treated as he deserved. Salien, A. 2965.  
**32** *Trembling.* Heb. “and Agag came to him delicately.” Sept. “trembling,” ( H.) or walking with a soft step, or “with bands *or* chains;” mahadannoth. See Pagnin. M.—Some think that he presented himself boldly, like a king, fearing nothing. Vatab.—*Manner.* Heb. “Surely the bitterness of death is past.” I have obtained pardon from Saul. But the sense of the Vulg. seems preferable, as he must have perceived, from the looks of the prophet, that death was hanging over him. Hence others translate, “is pouring upon me,” instead of, *is past.* Sept. “Is death thus bitter?” Chal. “I pray my Lord: the bitterness of death.” H.—*O death! how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that hath peace in his possessions*, &c. Eccli. 41:1. So Aristotle (Nicom. iii. 6.) says, “Death is most terrible, (περας γαρ) for it is a passage,” or separation, from all the things which could attach a man to this world. C.—This catastrophe of Agag and Saul, had been long before predicted. Num. 24:7. H.  
**33** *Pieces.* Josephus adds, by the hand of others. M.—But zeal put the sword into his own hand; and he imitated the Levites and Phinees, (Ex. 32:27) to shew Saul how preposterous had been his pity, when the Lord had spoken plainly. C.—*Lord*, as a sort of victim. Isai. 34:6. M.  
**35** *Saw Saul no more till the day of his death.* That is, he went no more to see him: he visited him no more. Ch.—He looked upon him as one who had lost the right to the kingdom, though he was suffered for a time to hold the reins of government, as a lieutenant to David. He might afterwards see Saul passing, but never to visit him, (Salien) or to consult with him about the affairs of state; ( M.) nor perhaps did he even see him, when Saul came to Najoth. C. 19:19, 24. His spirit came to announce destruction to Saul, the night preceding the death of that unfortunate king. C. 28. H.—*Repented.* God is said, improperly, to repent when he alters what he had appointed. S. Amb. de Noe, c. iv. W.

## Chapter 16

**1** *How long.* It seems his tears were not soon dried up, as he lamented the fall of one whom he had formerly so much admired, and perceived what evils would ensue. Salien.—He had hoped that the decree might have been revokable. But God now convinces him of the contrary, by ordering him to go and anoint a successor.—*Horn.* Such vessels were formerly very common, and were used to contain liquor, and instead of cups. 3 K. 1:39. Horace ii. Sat. 2. The ancient silver cups, at Athens, resembled horns. Athen. xi. 7. But the northern nations, particularly Denmark, &c. used horns to drink, as the Georgians still do. The rims are ornamented with silver, &c. Plin. xi. 37. Chardin. C.—A fragile vile was not used, but a horn, to denote the duration and abundance of David’s reign. Rupert. M.  
**2** *Of the herd.* Heb. “a heifer in thy hand.” H.—Females might be employed as peace-offerings. Lev. 3:1.—*Lord.* This was one, though not the principal reason. No one doubted but that he might lawfully offer sacrifice, at a distance from the tabernacle, as he was guided by God. The Jews allow that prophets have this privilege, and may dispense with the ceremonial law, (Grot.) when they act by God’s authority, as we ought to believe they do, as long as there is no proof to the contrary. H.  
**3** *Sacrifice*, to partake of the feast, ( M.) which must be consumed in two days, or thrown into the fire. Lev. 7:16. C.  
**4** *Wondered.* Heb. “trembled,” being full of consternation, ( H.) as the prophet did not now stir much from home; and fearing lest he had some bad news to impart, or had incurred the king’s displeasure, ( C.) unless he came to punish some of the people at Bethlehem. M.  
**5** Sanctified, prepared by aspersions, washing, and continence. Ex. 19:14. What sorts of uncleanness excluded from the feast, are specifie, Lev. 22. M.—Samuel arrived in the evening, and announced that sacrifice would be offered the ensuing morning. T.  
**6** *Him.* Heb. “surely the Lord’s anointed is in his presence.” This he spoke by his own spirit, judging from the comeliness of Eliab. C.—But the beauty of Saul’s body had concealed a deformed soul. H.  
**7** *Rejected*, or not chosen. M.—God had positively rejected this eldest son, as his pride seems to have been the greatest. C. 17:28. H.—*Heart.* This is one of God’s perfections. Glorified saints see man’s heart in his light, for their own and our advantage, (S. Greg. Mor. xii. 11. S. Aug.) as the prophets have sometimes done. 3 K. 14. W.  
**10** *Seven.* David was absent. Isai had eight sons. C. 17:12. Yet only seven are mentioned, 1 Par. 2:13. Perhaps one of those whom he produced on this occasion, might be a grandson, or one is omitted in Chronicles. C.  
**11** *Young son*, (*parvulus*,) “a little one;” ( H.) or the youngest, who might be about 15, ( C.) or 28. Seder. olam. iii. M.  
**12** *Ruddy*, like the spouse, Cant. 5:10. Some explain it of his hair. So Alexander is said to have had reddish or golden locks.—*Behold.* Heb. “with the beauty of the eyes.”  
**13** *Brethren.* Some say, without informing him, ( C.) or them, ( M.) what the unction meant. If he told the brothers, he would no doubt take the necessary precautions to keep it secret, as the whole family would have been in imminent danger, if the transaction had come to the ears of Saul, v. 2. Josephus says, that Samuel only informed Isai in private: and David’s brothers treated him with no peculiar distinction. Whence it is inferred, that they had not been present when he was anointed. Some witnesses seem, however, to have been requisite, as the title of David to the regal dignity depended on this ceremony, and none were more interested than his own family to assert his pretensions. He now had a right to the kingdom, but not the possession; being like a son expecting his father’s estate as his future right, of which, as yet, he cannot dispose. C.—*Came upon*, to make him prosper. M.—Heb. “came with prosperity; (Sept.) impetuosity.” God endued him with all those graces which might render him fit to command. C.—So David prays himself, “with a princely spirit confirm me;” (Ps. 50:14) or, *strengthen me with a perfect spirit.* Salien observes, that he did not now receive the spirit of charity, as if he had hitherto been in enmity with God, (C. 13:14) but he began to advance in virtue with more rapid strides, while Saul became every day more criminal and abandoned to the devil. H.—David received the spirit of fortitude and of prophecy, of which Saul had formerly had some experience, when he was first elevated to that high dignity. C. 10. He was changed into a new man, and adorned with all that could render a king most glorious. Though he returned to his wonted occupations, the spirit of the Lord enabled him to destroy wild beasts, as in play, (Eccli. 47:3) and to compose and sing many of those divine canticles which we still admire. Salien, A. 2969.—Whether he composed all the Psalms, as S. Chrysostom endeavours to prove, (præf.) we shall examine hereafter. H.  
**14** *From the Lord.* An evil spirit, by divine permission, and for his punishment, either possessed or obsessed him. Ch.—We no longer behold in Saul any generous sentiments. He falls a prey to melancholy, anger, suspicion, and cruelty. “He was seized with an illness, inflicted by the devil, says Josephus, (vi. 9.) so that he seemed to be choking; nor could the physicians discover any other means to alleviating his distress, except by employing some person skilled in music … David alone could bring the king ot his right senses, by singing hymns with the sound of the harp. Wherefore Jesse consented that his son should remain with the king, since he was so much delighted with his company.” H.—The Jews, and many Christians, suppose that Saul’s illness was melancholy, or “madness,” as S. Chrysostom calls it. It was inflicted by an evil, or even by a good angel, as the minister of God’s vengeance, (Ex. 11:4. C.) who punished his former pride and rebellion, by reducing him to so mean a condition. H.—S. Aug. and V. Bede suppose, that the evil spirit troubled him by God’s permission. W.  
**16** *Easily.* The effects which have been produced by music are truly surprising, if we may believe what the ancients have related. Our music may not at present be so striking, or we may keep a greater restraint upon our passions, and moderate the exterior demonstrations of our sentiments more than they did. C.—But, in the present case, there was probably some miraculous interference. H.—The disciples of Pythagoras lay a great stress on music, to calm the passions, (Quintil. ix. 4. M.) or to rouse them. p. 439. H.—It may also frequently contribute to restore health. Gallien, &c. See C. 10:10. 4 K. 3:15. C.—but God made it so efficacious here, to shew the virtue of David, and the injustice of Saul. W.—Thus, by the prayers of the Church, the devil is expelled. Theodoret. T.  
**18** *Him.* Some think that this took place before David’s victory over Goliath; others believe, that David was only made armour-bearer to Saul, after that event. We must not disturb the order of the sacred historian without some cogent reason: and the courtiers might already have heard of David’s prowess and virtue, of which he gave such evident proofs, after he was confirmed by the Holy Spirit, v. 13. C.  
**20** *Laden.* So Chal. M.—Lit. *plenum*, “full of.” H.—Sept. “a gomor,” which they seem to have read instead of the Hebrew chamor, “an ass of bread,” as Sosibius says, “he eats three asses’ of panniers of loaves.” C.—Prot. supply, “*laden.*”  
**21** *Bearer.* This was an honourable office. H.—Cyrus had been employed by his grandfather Astyages in the same capacity, before he came to the empire. Athen. xiv. C.  
**22** *Sight.* He had sent him back, as people of a melancholy temper are often hard to please; ( M.) and before David married Michol, he did not remain with the king, but only came when his presence was deemed necessary. C.  
**23** *Departed from him.* Chased away by David’s devotion. Ch.—The melody of David’s harp, as some of the Fathers remark, represent that sweet and engaging demeanour, which should distinguish the peaceful ministers of the gospel, … whether they strive to allay the rage, or dispel the fears of a troubled mind.” Reeves.—Nothing can equal the divine harmony of those sublime truths which are contained in the Psalms of David, and nothing can so powerfully contribute to drive away the spirit of pride from our hearts, and awaken them to the voice of heaven. S. Aug.—Some of these truths might make some passing impression even on the mind of Saul; and the devil could not bear to hear the praises of God. H.

## Chapter 17

**1** *Battle.* They perhaps had heard of Saul’s malady, (Salien) and bore a constant hatred to the Israelites during his reign. C. 14:52.—*Azeca*, about 15 miles south of Jerusalem.—*Dommim*, or Phesdommim, 1 Par. 11:13.  
**2** *Terebinth.* Heb. ela, “the oak.” Aquila.  
**3** *Valley* of the Terebinth, which S. Jerom seems to call *Magala*, v. 20.  
**4** *Base-born.* Heb. “of two sons,” or of obscure origin. A. Lapide.—His parents are no where specified, as Arapha is not, as some pretend, the name of his mother, but denotes that he was of the race of the Raphaim. 2 K. 21:16. Some translate, a man who challenges to fight a duel, or one who comes into the midst as “a champion,” to decide the cause of all the rest. Thus the Gaul defied the most valiant of the Romans, but was slain by M. Torquatus, Livy vii. Sept. “A strong man went out from the station,” &c. Chal. “There came out from them, out of the camp of the Philistines, a man named Goliath.” But many able interpreters adhere to the Vulg.—*Span*, about 12½ feet, so that he was taller than two common men. Those who call in question the existence of giants, will surely have nothing to object to this formal proof from Scripture. C.—The Vat. Sept. and Josephus read, however, “four cubits and a span,” or near eight feet. Ken.—Some reduce his height to 11 feet 3 inches, or even to 9 feet 9 inches, English. H.—His helmet weighed 15 pounds, avoirdupois; his collar, or buckler, about 30; the head of his spear (26 feet long) weighed about 38 pounds; his sword 4; his greaves on his legs 30; and his coat of mail 156: total, 273 pounds. Button. H.—Goliath was a figure of the devil, or of any arch-heretic, who provoketh the Church of God, but is slain by the humble with his own weapons. W.  
**5** *Scales*, like those of fishes. Sept. insinuate, that it was armed with things resembling fish-hooks; αλισιδωντον, *hamata.*—*Brass*, which was used for the armour of the ancients. Plutarch (in Demetrio) speaks of a coat of mail weighing forty pounds: the usual weight was twenty pounds. Lipsius.—The strength of the giant must have borne proportion with his size. C.  
**6** *Legs*, on the forepart, from the knee to the ankle. Vegetius observes, that the infantry wore such greaves of iron, only on one leg. C.—*Shoulders*, when he marched. M.—Some understand a dart, &c. but without any proof. C.  
**7** *Beam*, which was of a very different construction from ours. Hostius concludes, that all the armour of Goliath must have weighed 272 pounds and 13 ounces, including the buckler and spear which his armour-bearer carried before him. Plutarch allows a talent, or 60 pounds, for the usual weight of a soldier’s armour. Alcimus was remarked in the army of Demetrius, for having double that weight.—*Bearer.* Heb. “one bearing a shield,” or whose office it was to carry it, or any other part of the armour, when required. It would appear singular that the giant should have two bucklers, though David seems to specify two sorts. Ps. 34:2. This attendant might carry a large one, which would cover most part of the body, and was of service when a person had not to remove far from his place of battle. The buckler of Ajax was like a tower, and consisted of seven hides, covered with a plate of brass. Homer, Iliad Ζ. C.  
**8** *Out;* exulting. Eccli. 47:5. M.—*Servants;* I am free. H.—*Hand.* Such combats were very common in ancient times. Paris and Menelaus, Hector and Ajax. The Horatii and Curiatii fought to decide the fate of contending nations. Iliad γ, and Η.—Livy i. 23. C.  
**9** *Us.* It does not appear that this proposal was accepted or ratified by either party. The Israelites had still to pursue the enemy. E.  
**12** *Now*, &c. to v. 32. *And when*, is omitted in the Vatican Sept. which begins the latter verse thus, “And David said,” as the Alex. copy does now the 12th, which leads Kennicott to suspect that the intermediate verses are an interpolation, formerly unknown to the Greek version. Houbigant includes these verses between crotchets, “that it may be understood that these are not of the same author as the rest, and that the sacred writer may not be accused of making useless repetitions.” It has been observed in the last chapter, that David was the son of Isai, &c. “If, says he, this be omitted, there will be no vacuum in the context,” as there is none in the Roman edition: (11) “they were greatly afraid. (32.) And David said to Saul,” &c. As he had been appointed Saul’s armour-bearer, it was very natural to suppose that he would be near the king’s person on such an occasion, rather than feeding sheep. We find also, that he had a *tent* of his own, (v. 54) which he could not have had, if he had only come to bring provisions to his brethren. The unaccountable conduct of Eliab, the timidity of all Israel for forty days, &c. will thus be avoided. Josephus is supposed to have given occasion to this embellishment, though he takes no notice of many of those particulars which excite the surprise of Pilkington, Kennicott, &c. Dis. ii. p. 421. These verses were, however, in the Heb. before the days of Aquila, &c. and Origen received them from the Jews as genuine. A Hebrew Bible, (1661) with marginal criticisms, by a Jew, includes these verses within parentheses, as interpolated, as well as from v. 55 to C. 18:6, observing that “the history consists at present of different and inconsistent accounts.” The Syriac MS. of Masius generally confirms the Vatican Sept. (Morin) so that we conclude, that these verses are there asterisked on the authority of Origen, as not being in the original Greek, nor consequently in Hebrew. ib. p. 575.—*Mentioned.* Heb. “Juda, whose name … and the man went among men, an old man in the days of Saul.” We have already observed that the Alex. Sept. seems to promise a *speech*, but defers till v. 32, thus, “And David said, the son of an Ephrathite. He was from,” &c. H.—*Men.* Chal. “He was an old man, whom they ranked among the young,” as still vigorous. *Jam senior, sed cruda seni v* *iridisque senectus* *.* C.  
**13** *Battle.* In these wars, all attended as much as possible. C. 16:10.  
**15** *Bethlehem*, the king being relieved from his malady. “The greatest men formerly kept sheep.” *Ex antiquis illustrissimus quisque pastor erat* *.* Varro ii. 1. In this profession, David found many opportunities of signalizing his courage against wild beasts. C.  
**17** *Loaves.* The soldiers at that time, and perhaps always among the Hebrews, lived at their own expense, as the tribute which was paid to the king was not sufficient to support large armies, v. 25. C.—S. Paul insinuates, however, that soldiers were paid. 1 Cor. 9:7. H.  
**18** *Cheeses.* Heb. “of milk.” Sept. “pieces of soft cheese:” erts is no where else used to denote cheese. This was a present ( C.) for (Heb.) “the Chiliarch.”—*Placed*, who is their immediate officer. H.—Heb. “how they are mixed:” their company. Sept. &c. “what they stand in need of.” Sym. “Thou shalt receive their pay.” Syr. and Arab. “what news.” Others would translate, “their pledge,” or bill of divorce to their wives, that, in case they be made prisoners for three years, the latter may be allowed to marry. Trad. Heb. C.  
**19** *Fighting*, or ready to engage. H.  
**20** *Magala* signifies, “the circle, *or* chariots.” The Arabs still place their waggons and baggage round the camp, or in a circle. C.—It may also be a proper name. M.  
**22** *Brethren.* This inquiry seems rather unseasonable, when all were shouting for battle. Ken.  
**23** *Up*, or proceeding into the vale. M.—*Camp.* Heb. “ranks, *or* armies.”  
**24** *Exceedingly*, though they had now heard him twice a-day for so long a time, (Ken.) and came purposely to engage him and all the Philistine army. Perhaps he proceeded farther than usual. H.  
**25** *Tribute*, and all public charges, which may be burdensome. C.—It does not appear that these words are addressed to any one in particular, nor that the king had authorized such a declaration. H.—Yet the people all persisted in the same declaration, so that a promise must have been made. M.—It was never at least fulfilled. H.—Christ having overcome the devil, receives the Church for his spouse. W.  
**28** *Battle.* This speech is too insulting, even though David might seem to have given vent to the sentiments of his soul with too much ardour; particularly as Eliab knew that he had received the royal unction, ( C.) if that were not kept a secret from him. C. 16:13.  
**29** Sepak. Lit. “is it not a word” ( H.) of no farther consequences? May I not speak my sentiments? ( C.) as all others do. M.—Is not the thing enough to excite the indignation even of the coldest person, to hear this monster insulting God’s armies? The repeated inquiries of David, made people conclude that he was ready to fight the giant, ( H.) though as yet he had made no such proposal, whence it seems more improbable that his words would be reported to the king. Kennicott.—Prot. “Is there not a cause?” H.—Have I not an order from my father to come? M.  
**32** *Saul.* Lit. “to him.” But Heb. and Sept. have, “And David said to Saul,” which makes the connection between this and v. 11, more clear. H.—*In him*, or on account of Goliath. M.  
**33** *Boy*, compared with the giant, ( H.) or Saul, though David might be about 22 years old, (Salien) or near 30. T.—S. Aug. and Theodoret say only 14 or 16. M.—He had not yet been in the wars. C.  
**35** *Them.* He refers to two events, shewing his fortitude ( C.) and generous disposition, which rendered him fit for command, as he was not afraid to expose his life to protect his charge. H.—The pastoral care is an apprenticeship for the throne to him who is designed to be at the head of the mild flock of men, as hunting with dogs conducts to martial exploits. Philo in Vita Mosis.—He who has overcome the spirit of pride and of carnal pleasures, signified by the lion and the bear, is able also to gain a victory over the devil. W.  
**36** *I will … Philistine.* This is not in Heb. or the Sept. and it is marked as an addition in the ancient MSS. C.—Single combats, to prevent the spilling of more blood, may sometimes be authorized by public authority. Grotius.  
**39** *Armour.* Heb. “he tried to go.” Sym. “he went lame.” Sept. “he laboured in walking once and twice.” C.—Salien supposes that the armour was not made for Saul, as he was much more bulky than young David. Yet we find that the latter could use the sword of the giant without difficulty. S. Chrys. &c. H.  
**40** *Smooth.* Louis de Dieu translates broken “pieces of stones,” as he pretends, contrary to the common opinion, that rough stones are more suitable for the sling. C.—The learned Jew, whom we have cited above, (v. 12,) and several others, have inferred from this verse, that David seems to have just come from the flock. But Kennicott justly observes, that slingers were of great service in the army; and the “vessel of shepherds,” the bag or scrip, might well be used to obtain the stones; as the staff, makel, denotes a military weapon. (Taylor, Conc.) Diss. ii. p. 555. David was very expert in using these weapons, and the ordinary armour was encumbering to him. H.—“Valour depends more on its own efforts than on armour,” *tegumentis* *.* S. Amb. Off. i.  
**43** *Gods.* Dagon or Baalim. M.—Sept. Alex. has, “idols.” The beauty and accoutrements of David, made the rough warrior suppose that he was not coming to fight, but only to laugh at him and run away. H.  
**44** *Earth.* The heroes of modern days refrain from such compliments. Homer frequently describes his champions making long speeches in praise of their former exploits. David displays his piety and confidence in God. C.  
**47** *Battle*, whose armies thou hast defied, (v. 45. H.) or in general, He is the God of war, who grants victory to whom He pleases. C.  
**48** *Arose.* The Roman Triarii and the Gauls expected the hour of battle sitting. C.  
**49** *Forehead.* “The soul … more probably resides in the callous body of the brain,” (Eyre, Thesis 1797,) between the eyes. H.—*Ea* *rth*, quite lifeless, (Salien) or unable to resist. M.—The Balearic slingers scarcely ever missed their mark. Livy, viii. 4. The Chaldee supposes that David hit the eye, which was not covered with brass: but the stone might penetrate or kill Goliath through his helmet. Even a buckler is not capable of withstanding their violence. Diodorus, v. 207. See Judg. 20:16. C.—Pride sits on the forehead, and manifests itself by impudent behaviour. We must destroy it by humility, and by the cross of Christ. S. Aug. W.  
**54** *Tent*, or tabernacle of the Lord, which David erected in his honour, at Jerusalem, many years afterwards. Jun. Piscator, &c. The lower part of Jerusalem was already in the hands of the Israelites. He might place the armour for the present in the tent of his brethren. We find that the sword was deposited in the tabernacle, at Nobe. C. See v. 12. H.—The head was carried about to various cities. It would serve to strike terror into the Jebusites, at Jerusalem, and others. M.—The Vat. Sept. &c. immediately subjoin, C. 18:6. *Now*, &c. Lit. “And the women dancing, came to meet David.” H.—These three last verses occur only in the Alex. MS. though Theodoret (q. 43,) seems to have read them. In some other Greek copies, there is a long addition respecting David’s combat. See the New Hexapla. These verses are found, however, in Heb. Chal. &c. It is astonishing that Saul should not have known David. He was now more interested to be acquainted with his family, as he had engaged to give him his daughter in marriage. We must reflect that his malady might have impaired his memory, and David was still growing, so that a few months absence might produce a wonderful alteration, &c. C.—*Know not.* Lit. “if I know.” The different dress, in which David now appeared, gave rise to this ignorance. M.—Abner was not surely affected with the same malady as the king, who was obliged to ask David who was his father. But courtiers easily forget those from whom they have no expectations. H.—These strange proceedings make others conclude that this history is interpolated. Kennicott.—Huet maintains the contrary. D.—Saul only enquires about David’s parentage. Mariana. T.

## Chapter 18

**1** *Soul.* Pythagoras said, “that friendship is an equality, and one soul, and that the friend is another self.” It would be difficult to find two souls more tender and generous than those of David and Jonathan. C.—Josephus speaks of their friendship on another occasion, as these five verses are omitted in the Rom. Sept. &c. Ken.  
**3** *For he*, Jonathan. H.—*Soul.* “Friends have one soul.” Arist. Mor. ix. 8.  
**4** *Girdle*, which perhaps was of great value. Job 12:18. He wished that David should lay aside his shepherd’s dress, and appear like himself at court, that all might know how much he loved him. M.  
**5** *Prudently*, or with success. C.—*Especially.* Heb. “also,” which enhances his praise, as courtiers are but too apt to envy those who are taken from a low condition and set over them in the king’s favour. David must have displayed great wisdom and moderation. H.  
**6** *Philistine.* Some explain this of some fresh achievement against that nation, (Malvenda. W.) but without reason.—*Dancing.* Heb. also playing on the flute, or on some such instrument of music. C.—So Mary sung after the Israelites had crossed the Red Sea. Ex. 15:20. 2 K. 1:20. Judg. 11:34.  
**7** *Sung* *.* The chorus of their song is given. C.—“The women sung, *Saul slew his thousands;* and the virgins answered, *And David*,” &c. Josephus.—The death of Goliath was equivalent to the slaughter of thousands, as he had filled the whole army of Israel with dismay. H.  
**8** *A thousand.* These women were guilty of an indiscretion, through excess of zeal, as it is always displeasing for the sovereign to hear any of his subjects preferred before him. S. Chrys. hom. i. de Saul.—The jealousy of Saul was the more excited, as he had been threatened with the loss of his kingdom, and perceived in David all the qualifications of a king. *A malo principe tanquam successor timetur quisquis est dignior* *.* Pliny in Traj.—But was David responsible for what was spoken in his praise? C.—The Vat. Sept. omit what follows till v. 12. “And Saul feared David, (13) and he removed,” &c. The Alex. copy agrees with the Vulg. H.—Those who are proud, cannot bear the praises of others. W.  
**9** *Eye.* Sept. “and Saul suspected.” H.—Chal. “laid snares for David.” C.  
**10** *Prophesied.* Acted the prophet in a mad manner, ( Ch). like an enthusiast, ( C. 2 K. 9:11) or one possessed by the devil, as the Sybil was agitated by Apollo. *Et rabie fera corda tument* *.* Æneid vi. To alleviate his distress, David took up his harp. H.—*Spear.* With this weapon he was generally armed. C. 19:10. and 26:7. “It was used as a diadem formerly, and the ancients adored spears as gods.” Justin. xliii.  
**13** *People*, as their leader. Saul gave him an honourable, but dangerous office, to procure his destruction. This is frequently the manner in which men of superior talents have been treated, ( C.) as Corbulo, Germanicus, and Agricola were by three Roman emperors. Tacit. Ann. ii. &c.  
**15** *Began.* Sept. “he was filled with awe in his presence.” Heb. “he was afraid of him,” as he perceived that God protected him in all perils.  
**17** *And Saul.* This an the two following verses are omitted in the Rom. Sept. which subjoins, “and Michol, the daughter of Saul, loved David,” &c. H.—*Wife.* He had promised her already, ( M.) if the verses in the preceding chapter be genuine. But why then had he delayed so long, and why does he require other conditions? The comparison made by the women, (v. 7,) and the inconstant temper of Saul, might account for this. H.—*The Lord* defends his people. As long as the Israelites followed the orders of God, their wars might justly be attributed to him; but not when they were waged to satisfy the cravings of ambition. C.  
**18** *Life.* What exploits have I performed deserving such an honour? or what offices have my relations yet enjoyed? C.—David considers only his abject condition, and forgets his victories. H.  
**19** *Wife.* If this were the case, the character of Saul is rendered more despicable and perfidious. David never reclaims Merob, as he did Michol. H.—All the children of the former were gibbeted, 2 K. 21:9. The latter was given to David for his destruction, like Cleopatra (Dan. 11:17,) to Ptolemy. T.  
**20** *Other*, is not found in the Heb. Sept. &c. H.—Some Latin copies read, “David loved Michol,” ( C.) as the Douay Bible translates; the authors living before the Popes had published their authentic editions. H.—Both might be true. Drus.  
**21** *Days.* Heb. “In two thou shalt,” &c. C.—Prot. “in *the one of* the twain,” Merob or Michol. H.—Saul had deceived him with respect to the first; but he promises that he shall have “the second,” ( C.) or two motives induced the king to make him this offer, the victory over Goliath, and the slaughter of 100 Philistines. M. T.—The Sept. omit this sentence, and read, “And the hand of the Philistines was upon Saul, and Saul commended,” &c.  
**23** *Ability*, or riches. Sept. “without glory.” H. See v. 18.  
**25** *Dowry.* Among the Hebrews, the man had to purchase his wife.—*Philistines.* They were the nearest nation of those who were not circumcised; and thus Saul would prove that David had attacked them, which would greatly irritate them against him. C.—Josephus specifies six hundred heads, ( H.) falsely, (Horn) as he frequently disguises what might give his readers offence, as being either mean or incredible. C.—*Hundred* is not specified in the original Heb. copies, (Capel, iii. 17,) and David gives 200, v. 27. But Saul only stipulated for 100. See 2 K. 3:14. C.—*Wife*, “thinking it mean to be guilty of an untruth,” &c. says Josephus; “yet his disposition was not altered. He resolved, therefore, to take away his life, and wished Jonathan and his most trusty servants to put his designs in execution.” He then mentions the friendship of these two. But he takes no notice of the proffered marriage of Merob, and he seems not to have known that she was ever promised. See v. 17 and 19 and C. 17:12. H.  
**28** *David.* Of the subsequent verses, the Rom. Sept. has only the following words. “And all Israel lived him; (29) and Saul still continued to be in awe of him.” The Alex. MS. agrees with the Heb. only, instead of *Michol*, &c. it reads, “all Israel.” If the contested passages were omitted, the history would be less perplexed. But we must wait for the decision of the Church in matters of this nature, and never decide to peremptorily. H.  
**30** *Forth*, probably to revenge the recent insult. C.

## Chapter 19

**1** *Jonathan.* He was most interested, as David might be feared as a competitor; ( M.) and, under the cloak of friendship, he might more easily destroy him. Saul was a stranger to the generous sentiments of his son, or he would never have made the proposal. H.—Grotius compares him with Germanicus. C.  
**2** *Morning.* Sept. add, “to-morrow.” M.  
**3** *Field.* Saul would come thither, or Jonathan would sound his father’s disposition, and give David information in the place appointed. C.  
**3** *Hand*, in danger. M.  
**6** *Slain.* His inconstant temper might cause him to be moved with the expostulation of his son; but he presently relapsed, if he were ever sincere. C.—The Scripture seems to insinuate that he was. M.  
**9** *Saul.* His jealousy was again enkindled by the success of David. C.—*Hand*, on music, to assuage the paroxysms o the king’s fury. H.  
**11** *Morning*, fearing lest they might miss him in the night, (Salien) and perhaps desiring to see his execution, after he had been tried. Joseph.—The Philistines would not attack Samson at night. See Judg. 16:2. Ex. 14:20. The Parthians and Mahometans will do nothing at that time; moved perhaps by some superstitious notion. C.  
**13** *Image.* Heb. Teraphim*.* Aquila, “figures.” Sym. “idols.” Some believe that David had idols in his house, as ornaments, or to treat them with ignominy. Mercer.—But others cannot persuade themselves that he would keep such dangerous things. What Michol took, might therefore be some sacred representation, or a statue of some great man. Genebrard. (Kimchi. Maim.) Or it might be some piece of wood, or clothes folded up, so as to make the guards believe that David was in bed. Bochart, Anim. i. 2. 51. See Gen. 31:19. C.—They would not examine very narrowly. H.—The Taraphim denote both idolatrous and sacred things. Ose. 3:4. M.—*Skin.* Vat. and Alex. Sept. “liver,” still warm and in motion. T.—But they have followed a false reading, as well as Josephus and Aquila. C.—Some have inferred that the hair of goats in that country is reddish, because it was designed to resemble David’s hair, of the same colour. T.—This is, however, uncertain. The skin might form his pillow or coverlet. C.  
**14** *Sick.* This is an officious lie. She tells another to excuse herself, v. 17. The children of Saul strive to prevent their father’s cruelty, by taking part with the innocent David. H.—It is thought that David composed the 68th Psalm, *Eripe*, &c. on this occasion. C.  
**19** *Najoth.* It was probably a school or college or prophets, in or near Ramatha, under the direction of Samuel. Ch.—Chal. “in the house of doctrine.” See C. 10:5. M.  
**20** *Prophesying.* That is, singing praises to God by a divine impulse. God was pleased on this occasion that both Saul’s messengers and himself should experience the like impulse, that he might understand, by this instance of the divine power, how vain are the designs of man against him whom God protects. Ch.—The messengers did not return. M.—They were seized by the spirit only when they arrived at Najoth. But Saul felt the impression even at Socho, threw aside his garments, and began to act and to speak as one inspired. C.  
**24** *Naked.* Divested of his regal ornaments, ( T.) though not in an indecent posture. People are said to be undressed, when they have not such clothes on as might be expected. Hesiod and Virgil say, *Nudus ara, sere nudu* *s; hiems ignava colono* *.* “Plough and sow naked; choose a fine season for work, and rest in winter.” H. See Mic. 1:8. 2 K. 6:20.—Yet some assert ( C.) that Saul was entirely undressed, as some pretended prophets and slaves go in the hot countries. Isai. 20:1. We are not to judge of the indecency of such behaviour from our own manners. Some copies read *cecinit*, ( C.) and the Douay Bible has “and sang naked.” H.—Saul had not the gift of prophecy, like holy men, but only like Balaam’s ass, for a time. S. Aug. ad Simp. ii. 1. W.—*Prophets.* This is something wonderful. M.—The proverb was now confirmed. C. 10:11. C.

## Chapter 20

**1** *To Jonathan*, at Gabaa. He thought it no longer safe to remain at Najoth.  
**2** *Be.* The recent machinations and orders of Saul had been concealed from his son, with whom he used to consult on all important matters. C.—Perceiving, however, that Jonathan was unwilling to come into his measures, Saul, in his phrenzy, tried to destroy David. H.—But Jonathan, forming his judgment of others by his own upright heart, relied on the oath of his father, ( C.) and on the information he had lately communicated to him, when he desired David to be slain. M.—Abulensis believes that the particulars of a preceding reconciliation have been lost, which Salien supplies, A. 2973.  
**3** *As I may say*, is not in Heb. Sept. “the space between me and thy father is filled up, unto death.” We can never more have any union, nor dwell together in safety. H.  
**4** *Soul*, is often put for desire. Ps. 26:12. C.  
**5** *To-morrow is the new moon.* The *neomenia*, or first day of the moon, kept according to the law, as a festival; and therefore Saul feasted on that day; and expected the attendance of his family. Ch. Num. 10:10.—*Moon.* Lit. “calends,” a Greek word, intimating that the people were informed, or “called” together, on that occasion; as many nations follow the lunar system in the regulation of the year. H.—The Rabbins say that people were stationed on the highest hills to observe the first appearance of the moon, and to give notice of it. But for fear of a mistake, two days were observed, as here we see that Saul gave a feast for such a length of time. This, however, is very uncertain. David speaks without any reference to the watchmen, as of a thing well known to all. The reason of Saul’s feasting two days, was because one of them was the sabbath. The following work-day David came to Nobe, (v. 19,) and partook of the loaves which had been changed on the sabbath day. C. 21:6. Lev. 24:8.—*Sit.* The custom of sitting at table seems to have been more ancient than that of lying. The Persians chiefly introduced the latter. They had very low tables, so that one of them placed under the feet of Alexander, when he sat upon the throne of Darius, which was too high for him. Curt. v. Both customs frequently prevailed at the same time. Eccli. 9:12 and 31:12. Women probably always sat, as the Chaldee says Esther did. Est. 7:8. See Athen. i. 14. V. Max. ii. 1.—*Day.* The second of the month, after the sabbath was ended. C.—Pezron thinks that both the last and first days of the month were festivals. D.  
**6** *Tribe.* It might seem an effect of pride, not to accept of such invitations of the king, without some good excuse. Ovid speaks of feasts instituted for relations alone. Fast. ii.  
**7** *Height.* Heb. “the evil is completed (or resolved upon) by him.” H.  
**8** *Lord*, the most durable and sacred, confirmed by the name of God. C.—*Kill.* So Moses besought God to take away his life. A friend would put him to as little torture as possible. M.—But David only means strongly to assert his own innocence. H.  
**9** *Thee.* Heb. “then, should I not tell thee?” C.—Sept. “and if it reach not thy cities, I will inform thee.”  
**12** *After.* Sept. “The Lord … has known that I will sift my father, as opportunity shall serve, thrice,” or repeatedly. H.  
**13** **Ver** **.** **13** **.** *Father*, at the beginning of his reign. Jonathan foresees that David will be his father’s successor. C.—Hence he commends himself and family to his protection. M.  
**14** *Die.* Heb. lit. “If I live, thou shalt not shew me, &c … and if I die, (15) thou shalt not,” &c. It seems there is a negation too much. Jonathan requests that David would shew mercy to him and to his family; or he is willing that neither should partake of his kindness, if he prove a traitor to his friend. C.—Prot. “And thou shalt not only, while yet I live, shew me the kindness of the Lord, that I die not: (15) But *also* thou shalt not cut off they kindness from my house for ever, no not when the Lord hath cut off,” &c. H.  
**15** *May he.* It is a curse upon himself, if he should not be faithful to his promise.—*It.* That is, revenge it upon David’s enemies, and upon me, if I shall fail of my word given to him. Ch.—The Heb. and several Latin MSS. stop at *earth;* and what follows, is not found in some Greek and Latin editions. C.—*Enemies.* May God punish David’s enemies, and me among the rest. M.  
**16** *Enemies.* This seems to be a second translation of the former sentence, with a small variation.—*Required* may be expressed in the future, as an imprecation made by the two friends against those who should attempt to break the covenant, or to oppose David’s reign. Sept. omit this verse entirely, and translate the following, (17) “and Jonathan continued to swear to David, inasmuch as he loved him, because he loved the soul of the man who loved him.” He had such an affection for David, that he extended his love to all his friends. Prot. “so Jonathan made *a covenant* with … David, *saying:* Let the Lord even require *it* at,” &c. H.—He did so in due time, and the covenant between these two had its effect. C.  
**19** *Morrow.* Heb. “and after three days ( H. or, on the third day) thou shalt,” &c. Syr. and Arab. “Thou wilt be called for at table, at the third hour.” C.—Sept. use the same word, τρισσευσεις, as in the following verse: “I will shoot thrice at wild beasts, with arrows, sending as far as Laarmattarai,” so here they may insinuate that David must “wait three days,” ( H.) or come on each of these days, that he may not slip an opportunity. Cajet.—*Work.* Le Clerc translates, “in the day of the business.” Prot. “where thou didst hide thyself when the business was *in hand*, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.” Sept. Alex. “by this affair.” Vat. “Ergab,” a word which Grabe admits instead of εργον, in his edition. H.—Other copies, with the Syr. and Arab. have simply, “near this stone,” which Junius styles *speculam*, as if it were a butt or landmark, ( C.) or a stone to shew the road, (Lyran) or mile-stone, ( T.) which latter supposition is not probable, as David desired to be concealed. M.—He would therefore choose some cavern, so as to be able to hear what Jonathan said, without being seen. H.—This precaution was necessary for the safety of both. M.  
**23** *Ever.* Let us always inviolably adhere to our covenant. H.  
**24** *Field*, on the third day, having gone in the mean time to Bethlehem, v. 6.  
**25** *Arose*, out of respect. Sept. “he had the precedence over Jonathan” alone, as the latter sat “on the king’s right hand, and Abner on the left.” Arab. C.—David’s place was after Abner. M.  
**26** *Purified*, having perhaps touched some dead body, &c. Lev. 11:24.  
**27** *To-day*, which was the sabbath. C.—On the new moons people did not travel far. M.  
**29** *Sacrifice.* Heb. “my family hath a sacrifice,” &c. v. 5. H.  
**30** *A man.* Heb. “of an unjust revolt.” Thou hast taken part against thy father. C.—Prot. “son of the perverse rebellious *woman.*” Sept. “of the fugitive, ( H.) *or* of those girls who go in quest of men.” We must not suppose that Jonathan’s mother was really of this description. Saul, in rage, wishes to affront his son, ( C.) as some frantic parents call their children bastards, not reflecting that the reproach would fall upon themselves.—*Isai*, as he styles him out of contempt, v. 27.—*Mother.* Heb. &c. “of thy mother’s nakedness *or* shame.” M.—Instead of a crown, thou must expect ot be reduced to a private station, to the disgrace of my family. H.  
**31** *The so* *n of death.* That is, one that deserveth death, and shall surely be put to death. Ch.—So people are often styled sons of perdition, of hell, of light, &c. ( C.) when they are worthy of such things. H.—All the crime of David, was his too exalted merit, which, under a jealous prince, is often fatal. *Nec minus periculum ex magna fama, quam ex mala* *.* Tacit. Agricola.  
**34** *Great.* Lit. “in the anger of fury.” H.—*Him*, either David or Jonathan. C.—Indeed the crime of rebellion had been imputed to both. H.—Jonathan was grieved on account of the affront and danger ( M.) to which he had been publicly exposed, as well as for his friend, upon whose destruction he perceived that his father was now deliberately bent, and not merely during his fits of madness.—*Confusion.* Sept. “because his father had completed *his malice* against him;” ( H.) or, “had resolved to make an end of him.” C.  
**36** *Another.* The Heb. &c. do not express this distinctly; ( C.) but we find, v. 38, “the lad gathered up the arrows.”  
**40** *Arms.* Prot. “artillery:” but the bow and arrow, &c. are meant. The boy was sent away under this pretext.  
**41** *Place.* Prot. “out of a place towards,” &c. H.—Chal. “from the side of the rock Asha;” (or Ezel, v. 19,) though the name is written rather differently in Hebrew. But this was the place appointed. C.—Sept. “from sleep, … and *adored* him, … and each bewailed his neighbour, to great perfection.” H.—*More.* Jonathan strove to comfort him, as he was leaving wife, friends, and all. M.  
**42** *Stand.* This is not expressed in the text, which is left imperfect, ( H.) to denote the anguish of the parting friends, ( M.) very beautifully. Salien.—David did not exactly comply with this covenant, and his grandson lost half the kingdom. 2 K. 19. T.

## Chapter 21

**1** *Nobe* *.* A city in the tribe of Benjamin, to which the tabernacle of the Lord had been translated from Silo. Ch.—It was about 12 miles south-west of Gabaa. Tudelensis.—There was another Nobe on the east side of the Jordan, to which Serarius thinks David was three days in travelling. But when David made that assertion, he wished to conceal the real state of his affairs, as he had not seen Saul since he was at Najoth, v. 5. Nobe was afterwards accounted a sacerdotal city, v. 15. 2 Esd. 11:32.—*Achimelech*, who is perhaps the same with Achia (C. 14:3,) and Abiathar. Mark 2:26.—*With* *thee.* He would not expose his men to the resentment of Saul, ( C.) though he afterwards gave the priest to understand that he had some attendants, (v. 2) as the gospel relates. Mat. 12:3. He dismissed them before he entered Geth. C.  
**2** *The king*, &c. This was an untruth, which David, like many other great men, might think lawful in such an emergency. But it is essentially evil. C.—*And such*, which he deems it unnecessary to specify. Sept. retains the Heb. words, “Phelanni almoni.” See Ruth 4:1.  
**4** *If the young men be clean*, &c. If this cleanness was required of them that were to eat that bread, which was but a figure of the bread of life which we receive in the blessed sacrament; how clean ought Christians be when they approach to our tremendous mysteries? And what reason hath the Church of God to admit none to be her ministers, to consecrate and daily receive this most pure sacrament, but such as devote themselves to a life of perpetual purity. Ch.—*Women.* God required this on many occasions. Ex. 19:15. Urgent necessity determined Achimelech to grant the loaves, as our Saviour intimates, though it is probable that he first consulted the Lord. C. 22:16. C.—David perhaps went to Nobe on purpose to ask advice. M.—We have here an example of a dispensation, and of the distinction between *lay*, or common, and holy bread. W.  
**5** *Vessels*, i.e. the bodies, have been *holy;* that is, have been kept from impurity: ( Ch). in which sense S. Paul uses the word. 1 Thess. 4:4. It also includes garments, arms, &c. All was to be clean. Sept. “my men are all purified.” C.—*Defiled.* Is liable to expose us to dangers of uncleanness, ( Ch). as we shall perhaps have to fight. H.—*Sanctified.* That is, we shall take care, notwithstanding these dangerous circumstances, to keep our *vessels ho* *ly;* that is, keep our bodies from every thing that may defile us. Ch.—The text is very obscure. Heb. “the way is impure, because to-day it shall be purified in the vessel.” C.—Prot. “and *the bread is* in a manner common, yea though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.” We might eat of it in a case of such necessity. H.—Though laics be commonly debarred from tasting of it, we will partake of it with all due respect. C.—Sept. “the journey is (of a disagreeable nature, or) impure, therefore it will be rendered holy by my vessels,” or arms, in the king’s cause. H.—He seems to be going towards the infidel nations. M.  
**7** *Within.* Heb. mehtsar, “detained, *or* assembles before the Lord.” Theodoret thinks he was possessed; others believe he had made a vow, &c.—*Edomite.* Some Greek copies read, a Syrian, as also C. 22:9. C.—He had embraced the Jewish religion. M.  
**9** *This.* Chaldee observes, he gave this sword “after he had consulted the Lord with the ephod.” In a just war, the ornaments of the temples may be used. *Pro republic i plerumque templa nudantur* *.* Seneca. Grot. Jur. iii. 5. 2. C.—Tostatus believes that David would restore this sword, as soon as he had procured other arms.  
**10** *Achis* *.* He is elsewhere called Achimelech. This bold step was taken by God’s order, (Salien) or secret impulse, as the high priest and Doeg knew not whither David had directed his course. H.—Sanchez thinks David received no express declaration, as the event was not very prosperous. M.—Many great men have taken refuge among their greatest enemies, as Themistocles, Alcibiades, and Coriolanus fled respectively to the Persians, Lacedæmonians, and Volscians, and were received with great respect. Indeed the acquisition of such men is equivalent to a victory. C.—Though David might expect that his name would be hateful at Geth, as he had slain their great champion, &c. yet he had done it in an open manner, and had displayed the most heroic courage, so that the king and nobility might raise their thoughts above the vulgar sentiments of jealousy and revenge. Salien.—David only retired from the court of this king, to avoid the hatred of the courtiers; he returned again, and was kindly received. C. 27:1. C.  
**11** *Land*, equal to a king in glory. M.—Perhaps they had heard of the rejection of Saul, and reflected that their own country belonged to him, according to the terms proposed by Goliath. C.  
**13** *Countenance.* Heb. “sentiment, ( C.) *or*, behaviour.” H.—Chal. “reason.” He no longer acted as a prudent man, but like a fool.—*Down;* not fainting, ( C.) but like one in an epileptic fit. H.—Heb. “he feigned himself mad.” Chal. “stupid.”—*Stumbled.* Heb. “wrote, or made figures upon.” Sept. “beat the drum upon the gates of the city, and he was carried about, or acted the fool, in his hands, (παρεφερετο εν ταις χερσιν, αυτου: Amama would have, αυτων, *their*) and he fell against the doors of the gate,” &c. They seem to give a double translation. S. Aug. says, “we cannot understand how David could be carried in his own hands. But we understand how it was verified in Christ. For Christ was carried in his own hands at his last supper, when he gave, *or* commending, his own body, he said, This, &c. for he then carried his own body in his own hands.” In Ps. xxxiii. conc. i.) *Ferebat enim illud corpus in manibus suis* *.* Amama may laugh at S. Augustine’s ignorance of Hebrew, but the holy doctor was at least a sincere Catholic. H.—*Beard.* We find some wretched objects doing the same. Mar. 9:17. The spittle was deemed infectious. *Et illic isti qui sputatur, morbus interdum venit* *.* Plautus in Captivis.  
**15** *House.* David had not rushed into the palace of his own accord, but wished to remain concealed. Some of the people however knew him, and would have him to enlist as one of the soldiers of Achis; ( M.) or even designed to get him put to death, which made him have recourse to this expedient. Some of the saints have imitated him, to avoid worldly honours and dignities of the Church. H.—Thus the conduct of Jesus Christ himself, was accounted foolishness by worldlings. Mark 3:21. Luke 23:11. 1 Corinthians 1:23. V. Bede. W.

## Chapter 22

**1** *Odollam*, about two days’ journey from Geth, (Salien) nine miles east of Eleutheropolis, in the tribe of Juda. Euseb. C.—Jos. 12:15. 2 Mac. 12:38. M.—*Thither*, to avoid the fury of Saul, which fell so heavy upon the priests, v. 16. The most warlike sons of Gad came hither also, to join David. 1 Par. 12:8. Abul. Salien, A. 2973.  
**2** *Men.* His title to the crown was incontestable, so that he might justly make war, particularly in his own defence, and receive those who flocked to him to screen themselves from the persecution of Saul, and from their debtors, whom they would thus enable themselves to repay in time, by the plunder which they would take from the enemy. David maintained the strictest discipline, and withheld his men from making any disturbance, always manifesting the greatest respect for the person of the king. C.—The soldiers of Jephte were of the same description as these of David. Judg. 11:3. H.  
**3** *Of Moab*, to distinguish it from the city of Benjamin, where Samuel had assembled the people; ( M.) and perhaps also from the birth-place of Jephte, unless the Moabites had taken possession again of that part of Galaad. C.—Saul had made war upon this king, so that he was more ready to protect David, who departing soon after, by the admonition of Gad, (v. 5. C.) left those who could not follow him under his care. In the mean time he lived on plunder, taken from the surrounding enemies, (Tostat) and was joined by 200 men from the tribes of Benjamin and of Juda, (1 Par. 12:16,) with Amasai, his nephew, by his sister Abigail, at their head. Salien, A.C. 1079.  
**4** *The hold.* The strong hold, or fortress of Maspha. Ch.—It signifies “a watch-tower.” H.—In this place the parents of David probably finished their days, as we find no farther mention of them. Salien.  
**5** *Haret*, west of Jerusalem. Sept. read “the town of Haret,” (Euseb.) or “Sarec.” M.—*Rama*, “the height,” in Gabaa. C.—God would not suffer David and his followers to continue long among the infidels, for fear of danger. M.—The hero shews his ready obedience to the word of the unknown prophet, and is willing again to expose himself in the midst of Saul’s dominions. Salien.  
**7** **Ve** **r.** **7** **.** Jemini*.* Benjamites, my countrymen. Saul approaches them with being too little concerned about his interests, and falsely accuses his own son, who, it seems, had retired from court, after his father had attempted to kill him. But he shewed no signs of disloyalty. C.—The king mentions *the league* between Jonathan and David, on suspicion. C. 20:23. M.  
**9** *Servants*, or herdsmen. C. 21:7. Sept. “the Syrian, who was set over the mules of Saul.” H.—Informers are a set of men destructive to the public,” says Tacitius, Hist. i. 4.  
**10** *Consulted.* Some think this was a falsehood, as it is not mentioned before. Hugo.—But Achimelech does not deny the fact, v. 15. C.  
**12** *Achitob* *.* He gives him no honourable title, no more than David, (v. 7, &c.) out of disrespect. M.  
**14** *Faithful* *… and honourable*, are titles given to people of great distinction at court. C. 9:6. Num. 12:7. Gen. 34:19.  
**15** *For him?* We might read without an interrogation, “I have to-day begun …” (Chald.) never suspecting that it would be disagreeable to the king. C.—His character and his declarations, led me to conclude quite the contrary, so that I cannot lawfully be accused of any conspiracy. H.  
**17** *Messengers.* Heb. “runners.” These officers remained at court and were people of great account, ( C.) like the king’s guards, 2 K. 15:1. 3 K. 1:5. H.—*Lord*, out of reverence, and being convinced of their innocence. M.—The obedience which we owe to superiors is subordinate to that which we must always shew towards God and justice. C.—Saul unjustly condemned them as the abettors of his competitor. W.  
**18** *Five.* Josephus reads “385.” Sept. “305.”—*Ephod.* They all appeared in this dress, as they were priests. C.—It was different from the sacred ephod. Abulensis.—Thus the posterity of Heli was almost entirely cut off, as God had threatened. C. 2. D. T.  
**19** *Sword.* Saul, now abandoned God, acts against all law. He probably, on this occasion, destroyed the inhabitants of Gabaon, to make place for the tabernacle, which was removed hither. C. See C. 27:12.—He might also appoint Achitob high priest, the father of Sadoc, who supplanted Abiathar, 1 Par. 12 and 16:29. T.  
**20** *Escaped.* He had perhaps remained at Nobe, to do duty. M.—God was pleased to reserve him, ( C.) to convey the sacred ornaments of the high priest to David. H.—S. Bachiarius looks upon the slaughtered priests as martyrs. T.  
**22** *House.* Lit. “I am guilty,” &c. H.—“Good people acknowledge a fault, where there is none.” S. Greg.—David was aware of the malicious temper of Doeg, but he could not prevent its evil effects, as he had applied to the high priest without perceiving that he was there. H.—He received Abiathar at Ceila, which he had protected against the Philistines. C. 22.  
**23** *Saved.* We will be as one soul. On this occasion David composed the 51st Psalm, *Quid gloriaris*, to reprobate the conduct of Doeg. Salien.—We may consider David as the fourth in order of the sacred writers, as he appears after Moses, Josue, and Samuel. H.

## Chapter 23

**1** *Barns.* The floors were composed of earth and the dregs of oil, made into a sort of mortar, so that rain, mice, &c. could not hurt them. Cato 91 and 129.—Hither the people of Ceila had gathered their corn, and the enemy came to plunder, or to spoil, according to custom. Judg. 5:4 and 15:5. C.—Ceila was about seven miles from Hebron, and as many from Eleutheropolis. S. Jerom.  
**2** *Lord*, by the prophet Gad, (Salien. v. 6. M.) or by Abiathar, who brought the ephod along with him. David undertakes nothing without his advice.  
**3** *Judea*, in the midst of the country, remote from the Philistines; and in a forest, where Saul cannot so easily attack us, as in a city.  
**4** *Again*, in the presence of his soldiers. C.—Thus Gedeon requested a double miracle of the Lord, to encourage his men. M.  
**6** *An ephod*, or *the ephod.* That is, the vestment of the high priest, with the Urim and Thummim, by which the Lord gave his oracles.  
**7** *Bars.* This was what David’s men apprehended. Saul thinks this is a fit opportunity for taking them all prisoners; and he supposes that God was on his side, though, after his repeated crimes, he had little reason to flatter himself with hopes of this nature. The wicked, however, easily delude themselves. H.  
**8** *People*, in the neighbourhood. It is hardly probable that all Israel should be put in motion to take a few men. C.  
**9** *Secretly.* He might have pretended that the armament was against the Philistines. M.—*Ephod.* Some say that David put it on. But this was the privilege of the high priest, who gave the answer to David’s consultation, which he might perhaps repeat after him. C.—He put on the rational to consult God. Ex. 28. Lev. 8. W.  
**12** *Up.* God had only answered the first question before. He now informs David, that it is the intention of the men of Ceila to deliver him into the hands of Saul, who was preparing to attack their city, and that he would inevitably fall into his hands, ( C.) if he did not retire. W.—God sees contingent events with the same certainty as those which will really take place. H.—The people of Ceila could not have justly delivered up the innocent David, but they might have insisted that he should quit their city, to save it from destruction; or they might have forced him. Scholastic. T.  
**14** *Ziph*, eight miles east of Hebron, (S. Jer.) towards the southern Carmel. Euseb.—Abdias (v. 3) takes notice of the *clefts of the rocks* of Edom. S. Jerom says, this mountain was “dark and cloudy.” M.  
**16** *In God* exceedingly, reminding him of God’s promises. C.—He hoped to see David king, and himself next to him in power. H.  
**17** *Next*, in dignity; thy helper and associate. See Eccli. 4:8, 11.—*This*, our league, ( C.) or the decree appointing David to be king. M.  
**18** *Lo* *rd*, Gad or Abiathar being present. S. Jer.—This is the third time they had confirmed their alliance, to satisfy their love. M.  
**19** *Hand*, to the south. D.  
**22** *Him*, and therefore will be upon his guard. H.—Syriac, “because I am told he is crafty.” C.—Sept. “because Saul said, lest this crafty man should exert all his art;” or, “lest he should be very cunning.” H.—Saul foreboded that he would again elude his pursuit. Vatable.  
**23** *And if.* Heb. “if he be in the land, I will.”—*Thousands;* the cities, or with all the troops. D.  
**24** Maon, in Arabia Petrea, not far from Bersabee. C.  
**26** *Other side*, to the south.—*Despaired*, without the divine assistance. Salien.—Heb. nechpaz, “feared, or ( D.) made haste to flee.” Sept. “David was screened to depart.” He used all possible precautions not to fall into Saul’s hands, though he knew he should succeed him. He might still experience some fear of ill treatment. H.  
**28** *Division*, as it alone had been between the two rivals. Saul was obliged to leave the place, though he and his men were in suspense what to do. C.

## Chapter 24

**1** *Engaddi*, below Jericho, on the west side of the Dead Sea. It was famous for rocks and caverns. C.  
**3** *Goats;* an hyperbole. M.—Heb. “upon the rocks of the wild goats.” H.  
**4** *Cotes.* These were probably no other than the caverns, in which shepherds there secure themselves and their flocks, in the night, and from storms. T.—Some of them, in Syria, are so capacious as to contain 4,000 men, (Strabo xvi.) so that David might well remain unperceived by Saul, who did not enter so far. Polyphemus and Cacus dwelt in caverns, with their flocks. Virg. Æneid viii.—*Nature.* Heb. “to cover his feet,” which has the same import. Syr. and Arab. “to rest, *or* sleep.”  
**5** *Eyes.* This might have been spoken by Gad, or Samuel; ( M.) or they only mean that this is a most favourable opportunity. Some think that David ought to have embraced it, and put an end to these troubles, by the death of the usurper. But this was not the opinion of David; and God, who had promised him the throne, had not authorized him to lay violent hands on Saul. He might act on the defensive, but not be the aggressor. T.—*Arose*, with an intention to kill his unjust persecutor, v. 11.—*Robe*, to convince him how easily he might have taken away his life. S. Aug. de C. xii. 6.—The noise of Saul’s attendants hindered him from being perceived. Perhaps Saul might have put off his robe. M.—S. Chrysostom observes, the David obtained more glory by sparing Saul than by killing Goliath. T.—Clemency makes a man like God. Cicero.  
**6** *Heart struck him;* viz. with remorse, as fearing he had done amiss. Ch.—A tender conscience is uneasy about things which are not sinful, while some stick at nothing. W.—The action of David seemed disrespectful. C.—“The subjects of kings adore the royal name as a divinity.” Curtius vii. *Regium nomen … pro deo colunt* *.*  
**7** *Anointed.* He was chosen by God, and to be judge by him. C.—*Reges in ipsos imperium est Jovis* *.* Hor.—David was not to mount the throne, till Saul was removed, by God’s ordinance. W.  
**11** *A thought to kill thee.* That is, a suggestion, to which I did not consent. Ch.—Heb. “and he spoke to kill thee, and he has pardoned thee; and he said, I will not,” &c. C.—Prot. “and *some* bade *me* kill thee, but *mine eye* spared thee, and I said.” Sept. “and I would not kill thee, and I spared thee, and said,” &c. H.  
**12** *Father.* He had married Saul’s daughter; ( M.) and the king ought to be the common father of his people. H.  
**13** *Revenge me of thee;* or, as it is in the Hebrew, *will revenge me.* The meaning is, that he refers his whole cause to God, to judge and punish according to his justice; yet so as to keep himself, in the mean time, from all personal hatred to Saul, or desire of gratifying his own passion, by seeking revenge. So far from it, that when Saul was afterwards slain, we find that, instead of rejoicing at his death, he mourned most bitterly for him. Ch.—If it be lawful to seek redress from a magistrate, much more may we appeal to the Sovereign Judge! M.  
**14** *Thee:* the tree is known by its fruit. If therefore I have behaved in this manner, no longer trust the reports of others against me. C.—The wicked, if left to themselves, will be their own tormentors. He may thus indirectly threaten Saul, as iniquity is often put for punishment. M.—The wicked shall at last open thier eyes, and be reclaimed. Rabbins ap. Munster.—David entertained hopes that even Saul would now be convinced of his innocence. H.  
**15** *Dog.* This expression is still used to denote a contemptible person. 2 K. 16:9. What honour can so great a king derive, from gaining the victory over a man unarmed? &c. C.  
**17** *Voice.* He was at such a distance, as not to be able to distinguish his features.—*Wept.* The greatest reprobates may sometimes feel sentiments of compunction, so that we need not here doubt of Saul’s sincerity. C.—He might otherwise have turned upon David with his 3,000, and easily have seized his prey. H.  
**22** *Father.* David complied with this request as far as he was able: but, as God was resolved to punish the posterity of Saul, for the injury done to the Gabaonites, he was forced to give them all up, except Miphiboseth, the son of Jonathan. C.—He could not promise to defend them, if they proved guilty.  
**23** *Places*, knowing that no dependence was to be had on Saul. M.—How blind and ungrateful must this king have been, thus to fight against the known designs of Providence, instead of endeavouring to reward and to make a friend of so great a person! H.

## Chapter 25

**1** *Samuel died.* The Rabbins say four months before Saul. Seder, olam 13. T.—Others believe about two years; and suppose that he was 98 years old, twenty of which he had been judge: ( C.) Salien says 38, and that he lived seventy-seven years. M.—On all these points the learned are divided. C. 7:15. They are more unanimous in praising ( H.) the conduct of this most holy statesman. Grotius compares him with Aristides. C.—But he Holy Ghost gives Samuel a far more glorious character. Eccli. 46:16. &c. H.—Both he and his mother are figures of the two testaments. Anna becomes fruitful—Samuel is substituted in the place of Heli. The sterility of Anna represents the incapacity of the Synagogue, to produce living and virtuous children. She bears Samuel, the figure of Jesus Christ, who reunites in his person the royal and the sacerdotal dignity. But under another point of view, Samuel, how perfect soever, must give place to the more perfect David, the glorious type of Jesus Christ, and thus the Synagogue, notwithstanding all her prerogatives, must yield to the Church. See S. Aug. de C. xvii. 1, 4. Many of the ancients have looked upon Samuel as the high priest: but the generality have acknowledged that he was only a Levite, ( C.) or an extraordinary priest, like Moses. H.—*All Israel*, or many from every tribe, assembled to attend his funeral; ( T.) and all mourned for him, as they had done for Moses and Aaron. Salien.—*House*, or among his kindred, ( T.) in a place which he had chosen for his tomb. This is called *the house* of the wicked *for ever;* but the just raise their hopes much higher, and await a more splendid palace above, and a glorious resurrection. H.—The would not bury Samuel in his dwelling-house, as it could not then be entered without incurring an uncleanness. C.—His bones were translated with great respect to Constantinople, and a noble mausoleum was built for them by the emperor Justinian. Procopius v. S. Jer. c. Vigil. T.  
**2** Maon*.* Vat. Sept. has the same word in the preceding verse, instead of Pharan. H.—*Possessions.* Heb. “work.” Cattle then formed the chief source of riches. Carmel and Maon were not far from Pharan, in Arabia. C.  
**3** *Caleb*, the famous companion of Josue. His name means, “a dog;” whence the Sept. “he was a Cynic.” Josephus, “he followed the manners of the Cynics,” who were remarkable for their impudence, like dogs. Caleb was of the same tribe as David, and ought to have been more favourable to him on that account, v. 6. H.  
**7** *Molested them.* This deserved some acknowledgment, as they might have done it with impunity. But David had also been of service to Nabal’s men, as one of them told Abigail, v. 16–21.  
**8** *Good day*, set aside for rejoicing, w hen the sheep were shorn. 2 K. 13:24.  
**10** *Masters.* As if he had said, you and David are but fugitive slaves. C.—He might also insinuate, that David encouraged such practices. C. 22:2. H.  
**11** *Water*, under which name all sorts of drinks are included. Nabal had plenty of wine, and was much intoxicated, v. 36. Sept. translate, “wine.” Syr. and Arab. “drink.”—*Cattle.* Heb. “victims,” which is a term used both for sacred and profane feasts.  
**14** *Re* *jected them.* Heb. “flew against them.” Chal. “saw them with disgust.”  
**17** *Determined*, and as if it had already taken place. C. 20:7.  
**18** *Raisins.* Hebrew tsimmukim, “dried raisins,” or clusters of an extraordinary size. Roger speaks of some gathered in the vale of Sorec, which weighed 25½ pounds. A.D. 1634. Sept. “a gomer of dry raisins.” Syr. and Arab. “a hundred cheeses.”—*Cakes.* Chal. “pounds.” Heb. is imperfect, two hundred … of figs. We must supply ( C.) *cakes*, with the Prot. &c. or pounds, with the Chaldee, ( H.) as each of the cakes perhaps weighed so much. M.  
**19** *Nabal.* Knowing his churlish temper, and that he was drunk at this time, (v. 36. H.) she might be well excused from the ordinary laws which forbid a wife to dispose of her husband’s property, without his consent. The emergency left no time for consultation. She gave a part to save the whole. C.  
**20** *Foot.* Heb. “in the obscurity,” or road covered with trees. Sept. “in the shade.” Chal. “on the side.” David was descending from the mountains of Pharan, at the same time.  
**22** *The enemies*, is left out in some editions of the Sept. But David wishes all evils to himself, though, to avoid the ominous expression, he specifies his enemies, if he do not punish Nabal.—*Leave.* David certainly sinned in his designs against Nabal and his family, as he himself was afterwards sensible, when he blessed God for hindering him from executing the revenge he had proposed. Ch.—*All.* Chal. “any one who is come to the use of reason.” Syr. and Arab. “the least thing hanging upon the wall.” I will destroy the guilty, and plunder all the valuable effects. C.—But the Heb. Sept. &c. agree with the Vulg. and the meaning is, either that every *man*, or that every *dog*, and even the meanest things, should be enveloped in the general ruin. H.—The manners of men vary, but those of dogs are always the same. Hence, it is more generally supposed that this expression ( C.) denotes that even dogs shall be exterminated, and consequently other things for which Nabal would have a greater affection. H.—Aurelian being irritated against the inhabitants of Thiane, swore, “I will not leave a dog in this town;” which all people explained as if he meant to leave nothing alive in it. But being afterwards moved with compassion at the distress of the people, he executed his threat literally, and killed all the dogs. Vopisc. See 3 K. 14:10 and 15:29. and 21:21. and 4 K. 5:6. Bochart, Anim. ii. 55. Delrio, adag. 184. C.—The unhappy Geddes translates, “a dog,” to avoid the indelicate allusion. It would have been well if he had allowed himself no greater liberties! H.—The Heb. mashtin, may denote a shepherd’s or a mastiff dog. M.  
**24** *Iniquity*, or the punishment of this fault, v. 28. C.—She wishes to divest the mind of David from the consideration of her husband’s incivility; and, after condemning it herself, insinuates that it would be unbecoming for a great king to mind so insignificant an enemy, v. 28. H.—Thus the emperor Adrian, and Louis XII. would not resent the affronts which they had received before they were raised to that high dignity. T.  
**25** *The king*, is not in Heb. Sept. &c. David’s title was not yet publicly acknowledged. C.—But Abigail plainly alludes to it, v. 28. H.—*Name. Nabal*, in Hebrew, signifies *a fool.* C.—Thus she extenuates his fault, by attributing it to a deficiency in understanding.  
**26** *To thee.* She felicitates David on not having put his design in execution. C.—Theodoret thinks he might lawfully have done it; but others believe that the fault bore no proportion with the intended punishment. T.—*As Nabal*, devoid of sense. Abigail displays the eloquence of nature. C.  
**27** *Blessing*, or present. M. See 2 Cor. 9:5. C.  
**28** *House.* Thy family shall long continue in the enjoyment of the royal power. Chal. “an established kingdom.” H.—*Lord*, as his general.—*Evil.* Do no manner of injustice. Heb. “and evil hast not been found,” &c. Hitherto thy life has been irreproachable. C.  
**29** *Bundle.* Such things are more secure than those which are loose. W.—*Of the living*, or predestinate, over whom Providence watches in a particular manner. She seems to allude to the method of carrying pieces of silver in bundles. Prov. 7:20. Chal. “the soul of my lord shall be in the treasury of the lives of the age, before the Lord God.” C.—It shall be preserved for length of days, like something most precious, ( H.) while the wicked shall be in continual danger and anxiety, like a stone in a sling. Zac. 9:15. By substituting *c* for *b* in Heb. the sense may be still more striking: “the soul of my lord shall be preserved like a living (precious, serviceable,) stone. But the soul of thy enemies shall be whirled in a sling.” The Hebrews had a great esteem for slingers, so that this comparison would be sufficiently noble. A living stone is often mentioned both is sacred and in profane authors. 1 Pet. 2:4. Virgil Æneid i. 171. *Vivoque sedilia saxo* *.*  
**30** *Israel*, a thing which all expected, and even Saul himself. C. 24:21.  
**31** *Scruple.* Heb. “scandal,” or sin, for David might defend himself, but ought not to attack or take revenge, like a king. Grot.—*Innocent.* Many of Nabal’s family were such, and even his fault did not deserve death. Heb. “shed blood without cause.” C.—*Handmaid*, who has suggested this good advice. M.—David was so much pleased with her prudence and beauty, that he afterwards married her.  
**32** *Speech.* Heb. “advice, *or* wisdom.” Sept. “conduct.” C.  
**35** *Face.* I have been pleased with thy coming, and granted thy request. H.—David had sworn with too much haste. C.—“It is sometimes wrong to perform what has been promised, and to keep an oath.” S. Amb. Off. i. C. ult.  
**36** *Morning.* Admirable pattern of discretion, and how reprimands may be made with advantage. C.—A medicine given at an improper time often does harm. Plin. xvii. 27. When a person said to Cleostratus, “Are you not ashamed to get drunk?” he replied, “Are you not ashamed to rebuke a drunken man?”  
**37** *Stone.* Stupified at the thought of the imminent danger to which he had foolishly exposed himself. So the poets represent Niobe as metamorphosed into a stone, at the hearing of her children’s death. T.—Josephus intimates that Nabal was killed by the malignant influence of the stars, sideratus. Ant. vi. 14. Thus, says he, David “learnt that no wicked person can escape the vengeance of God, and that Providence does not neglect human affairs, and abandon them to chance.”  
**39** *Blessed be*, &c. David praises God on this occasion, not out of joy for the death of Nabal, (which would have argued a rancour of heart) but because he saw that God had so visibly taken his cause in hand, in punishing the injury done to him; whilst, by a merciful providence, he kept him from revenging himself. Ch. Ps. 57:10.  
**41** *Thy servant.* She speaks to David’s representatives, as if he had been present. H.—The marriage was proposed probably a month or two after the death of Nabal; and Abigail followed the messengers, in a short time. M.  
**43** *Took*, or “had taken before,” according to Josephus. Hence she is placed first, ( C.) as the mother of David’s first-born, Amnon. 2 K. 3:2. M.—Michol, whom he married first, had no children. H.—*Jezrahel*, a city of Juda. M. Jos. 15:56.—There was another more famous place of this name is Issachar.  
**44** *Phalti*, or Phaltiel, 2 K. 3:15. Saul violated all laws by so doing, and David took her back when he came to the throne, which he could not have done if he had given her a bill of divorce. Deut. 24:4. C.—Michol was not blameless in living thus with another man. M.—The Rabbins say that a sword hindered Phalti from approaching her. Horn in Sulp.—*Gallim*, a city of Benjamin. Isai. 10:30. C.

## Chapter 26

**1** *Ziph.* Having declared themselves so decidedly against David, they apprehended the utmost danger if he should ascend the throne.—*Hill.* Heb. “Gabaa,” as the Vulg. leaves it, v. 3. It lay to the right hand of Ziph, (C. 23:19,) or “of Jesimon.” Sept.  
**4** *Certainly*, or in a place strongly secured by nature. Sept. “well armed.”  
**5** *Tent*, or covered chariot, such as the Scythians use in their marches. Justin i. or in a “royal tent.” Sept. λαμπηνη, (Pollux. M.) “richly ornamented,” (Lucifer of Cagliari) “in the midst” (Aquila) of his troops. C.—David might see all was quiet from an eminence, or he might be informed by his spies. M.  
**6** *Hethite.* He had probably embraced the Jewish religion.—*Abisai* was the son of Sarvia, David’s sister, and made a great figure at court. C.—David was directed by God to manifest his clemency ( M.) and reverence for Saul in this perilous attempt. H.  
**8** *My.* Heb. “the spear,” which was fixed in the ground at Saul’s pillow. Prot. “let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear, even to the earth, at once, and I will not *smite* him a second time.” H.  
**9** *Guiltless.* Saul was still his king, how wicked soever, and this title rendered his person inviolable. The eastern nations are very seldom guilty of rebellion, or of murdering their kings; a thing of which we find so many examples in the Roman, English, and French histories. C.—A private man could not lay violent hands upon the king without a crime; and therefore David represses Abisai, and commits his cause to God. C. 24:13. M.—He will not permit any one to destroy the life of the king, though he was already anointed to succeed him. W.  
**10** *To die* a natural death. Thus those who are slain, are said to die before their day. Ps. 54:2–8. Jesus was not taken, *because* *his hour was not yet come.* John 2:4 and 7:30. C.—David waits with patience, that God might take off his adversary by sickness, old age, or the sword. M.—He will not ascend the throne before the time appointed, and he will not kill Saul, except it be in battle, in his own defence. H.  
**12** *Water*, for refreshment, or for purifications.—*Lord.* It is not necessary to have recourse to a miracle, ( C.) though it must have been by a special providence that all continued in such a deep sleep, ( H.) to give David an opportunity of manifesting his innocence. W.  
**15** *Israel.* This was a cutting irony. C.—Salien attributes to it the enmity which Abner bore to David for above seven years. M.  
**16** *Death;* i.e. you deserve to die. Such negligence was punishable with death, according to the Roman laws; *& qui excubias* *.* Grot.  
**19** *Sacrifice*, that he may be appeased; (Jonathan. Vatab.) or rather, I am willing to fall a victim, ( M.) and pray that thy sacrifice may be acceptable, and all thy designs against me succeed. Ps. 19:4.—*They are.* The opposition of this sentence to the preceding seems to require “let them be,” &c. What in effect did not those deserve who wished to make David adore false gods? C.—*Lord* in the land of Israel.—*Gods.* They said so, at least by their actions. M.—All other countries were in a manner abandoned to idol-worship, so that a person could not dwell in them, without the most imminent danger. See 2 K. 14:16. Ps. 83:12. C.  
**20** *Before*, the contrary to the decrees of *the Lord*, ( H.) who will be my avenger.—*Hunted*, (persequiur) is here used in a passive sense; ( C.) or it may be rendered, “as a partridge pursues” what it feeds upon. H.  
**21** *Precious*, and treated as such, with care and respect. See 4 K. 1:14. Ps. 48:9. Isai. 43:4.—*Ignorant.* Yet Saul was inexcusable. 2 K. 24:10, &c.  
**22** *It.* He would not keep the spear, lest it might seem disrespectful.  
**24** *Set by.* Lit. “magnified,” or deemed very precious. H.—*Distress.* These were the last words which David addressed to Saul; and they seem to have made a deep impression upon him. But as no dependance could be placed on Saul’s most solemn promises, David resolved, by God’s advice, to retire to the country of Geth. Salien. A. 2978.  
**25** *Prevail*, and mount the throne.—*Place*, Gabaa. M.  

---

## Chapter 27

**1** *Hands.* God requires that we should act with prudence. D.—David probably consulted the Lord, and sent ambassadors to Achis, before he went into his dominions, ( M.) where he had been in such danger before. D.  
**2** *Maoch*, or *Maacha.* 3 K. 2:29. This king had perhaps seen David, when he counterfeited madness. But now he was convinced that, by granting him protection, he would greatly annoy Saul, and draw many brave men out of his dominions.  
**3** *Household.* They were aware of the cruelty of Saul. The names of these valiant men are specified, 1 Par. 12:1. &c.  
**5** *Country*, less peopled, and more remote from the sea.—*With thee.* David was attended like a king, so that he wished to avoid giving umbrage to Achis, and, at the same time, keep his own men at a greater distance from the contagious morals of the idolaters.  
**6** *Day.* This was written some time after the death of Samuel.—*Siceleg* belonged at first to Juda, and was afterwards given to the tribe of Simeon, till it fell into the hands of the Philistines, and being restored by them to David, was considered afterwards as the property of the kings of Juda. It lay not far from Horma. Jos. 19:4.  
**7** *Months.* Heb. “days and four months.” The former expression denotes a year; though some would have it, that David remained “four months and a few days” in the country. He probably continued so many months at Geth, (v. 9, 11,) and about a year at Siceleg. C.—Sept. have “days, four months;” and Salien adopts that term. H. See C. 29:3. D.  
**8** *Pillaged Gessuri*, &c. These probably were enemies of the people of God; and some, if not all of them, were of the number of those whom God had ordered to be destroyed; which justifies David’s proceedings in their regard. Though it is to be observed here, that we are not under an obligation of justifying every thing that he did: for the Scripture, in relating what was done, doth not say that it was *well* done. And even such as are true servants of God, are not to be imitated in all they do. Ch.—The nations of Chanaan, who inhabited as far as Egypt, and the Amalecites, who had escaped the arms of Saul, were devoted to destruction. Ex. 17. &c. In such cases, any man might fall upon them, without any other formal declaration of war. C.—There was another *Gessuri* of Syria, in the tribe of Manasses, across the Jordan. M.—The country which these people inhabited, to the south of Palestine, was afterwards depopulated by the kings of Egypt and of Syria, in their continual wars, so that many of the cities which are mentioned in Scripture, were never known to profane geographers. C.—S. Jerom, (Trad.) Sa, and others, think that David attacked some of the Philistines. But it is as probable at least that he would abstain from molesting them, whom had so generously afforded him an asylum. Salien concludes, that he did not attack the other nations, (except the Amalecites, who were sufficiently marked out for destruction, Deut. 25:19,) without consulting the Lord, by the high priest, as he was accustomed to do in every difficulty. A. 2979. M.—They all dwelt in part of the land of Chanaan, ( W.) which was sufficient. H.  
**9** *Apparel.* Saul alone had been ordered to destroy all the property of Amalec. Abulensis.  
**10** *Jerameel*, the son of Esron, inhabited the most southern part of Juda.—*Ceni*, or the Cinites, descendants of Jethro, ( C.) who dwelt at Arad and the environs. The words of David might signify that he attacked these people of Israel, as Achis understood him; or that he made inroads upon those who dwelt to the south of them, which was really the case. H.—At his return, he passed by Siceleg, where he left the spoil, carrying some of the choicest things, as a present, to Achis. M.—But he suffered none of the human race to be carried away captive, lest any of them might disclose the true state of affairs to the king, who might have apprehended that the injured nations would make an attack upon his dominions. Salien.  
**12** *Harm* *.* Heb. “he hath made himself stinking (an object of horror) to his people.” A strong expression used, Gen. 34:30. Ex. 5:21. C.—Sept. “he is quite covered with confusion.” Achis supposed that David had thus forfeited all his pretensions to dwell among, much less, to reign over Israel: so that he might keep him always in his service. H.—In the mean time, Saul was exterminating the people of Gabaon, which brought a pestilence on Israel, 40 years later. Theodoret.—He perhaps supposed that the oath of Josue had not been yet put in execution, as it ought to be, herein indulging too much his cruel temper. Salien.

## Chapter 28

**1** *Israel.* God made use of the ill-will of the Philistines to punish Saul, and to make way for David to the throne. Salien.—Each of the five lords brought their armies into the field, where they were united. Achis, placing the greatest confidence in David, requires his attendance. C.  
**2** *Do;* or “can do.” Thou wilt be convinced of my valour and fidelity. H.—But could David lawfully fight against his brethren? or could he desert Achis in the heat of the engagement? His answer is ambiguous. C.—He prudently committed his cause into the hands of Providence, resolved to do nothing contrary to his duty, and to abide by God’s decision, in this critical juncture, so that Cajetan blames him unjustly. Salien. M. T.—*Guard.* Sept. “captain of my body guard.”  
**3** *Samuel.* His death is here recorded, as well as the abolition of magic, to explain what follows, when Saul, not being able to obtain an answer from God, as his prophet had been withdrawn in anger, had recourse to the devil. H.—*Land*, while he reigned virtuously, ( M.) according to the law. Lev. 19:31. Deut. 18:11.  
**4** *Gelboe* *.* So that he occupied the parts south of the vale of Jezrahel, while the Philistines were encamped on the north, in the tribe of Issachar. M.  
**5** *Dismayed.* It was so numerous, while his own conscience upbraided him with being at enmity with God, who increased his fears. Salien.  
**6** *Dreams.* During which God often revealed his will. See Deut. 13:3.—*Priests.* Heb. “nor by Urim.” It seems Saul had appointed some priests, and had fabricated a fresh ephod, with the Urim, &c. after the departure of Abiathar. C.—But Salien calls this in question, and there might neither be priests nor prophets for Saul to consult. H.—God despised a man, who had slain so many of his sacred ministers. M.  
**7** *Spirit.* Heb. “an *ob*,” or vessel distended, as such impostors seemed to swell at the presence of the spirit. Sept. “a belly talker.” They endeavour to speak from that part. We read of some who, without magic, have possessed the art in great perfection, so as to deceive the company, and make them think that some one was calling them from a great distance; as was the case with one Farming in England, 1645. Dickenson, c. 9.—Brodeus mentions that the valet of Francis I. could thus counterfeit the speech of people deceased, and by these means prevailed upon a rich woman to marry him, and a banker of Lyons to give him a large sum of money. James Rodoginus, a possessed person in Italy, 1513, could make articulate sounds from the hollow of his belly, when his lips and nostrils were closed up. The oracles of idols were generally given in a low tone, as if they proceeded from the earth. *Submissi petimus terram & vox fertur ad aures* *.* Virg.—Those of Apollo were the most famous, and hence a divining spirit is called a *Python.* Saul must have been stupidly blind, thus to depend on what he had formerly banished with such care. C.—He flattered himself that some would still be left, especially among the women, who are most addicted to superstition, as well as to religion. M.—*Endor* was distant from Gelboe about four hours’ walk. Adrichomius.—But Saul made a long circuit to avoid the enemy. Salien, v. 20.  
**8** *Clothes*, that he might not fill the woman or his army with dismay. C.  
**10** *Thing.* He adds this crime of swearing unjustly, to all the rest. Saline.  
**11** *Samuel.* Here we behold the antiquity of necromancy, which is a proof that people believed the soul’s immortality; *animas responsa daturas* *.* Horace i. sat. 8. C.—Protestants sometimes deny ( H.) that souls appear again, contrary to this history and Mat. 17. S. Aug. W.  
**12** *Woman.* The Rabbins pretend that she was Abner’s mother, ( C.) which is extremely improbable, as he was of the tribe of Benjamin, and a man of such renown. Salien.—Theodoret follows their opinion, in supposing that the woman was startled, because Samuel appeared in a standing posture, and not with his feet upwards, or lying down on his back, as in a coffin, which they say ( C.) is the usual manner of spirits appearing to people of her character. Bellarm. Purgat. ii. 6.—She *cried out*, because he appeared before she had begun her incantations, and was arrayed like a priest, according to Josephus, ( H.) in great majesty, or she pretended to see him, the better to impose upon the king; for some think that all was a delusion. C.—*Saul.* This she learnt either from Samuel, (Josephus) or from her familiar spirit. M.  
**13** *Gods*, or one venerable and divine personage. W.—Elohim, is applied to Samuel for greater honour. It is a title given to the true God, to idols, and people in dignity. C.  
**14** *Understood that it was Samuel.* It is the more common opinion of the holy fathers, and interpreters, that the soul of Samuel appeared indeed; and not, as some have imagined, an evil spirit in his shape. Not that the power of her magic could bring him thither, but that God was pleased for the punishment of Saul, that Samuel himself should denounce unto him the evils that were falling upon him. See Ecclesiasticus 46:23. Ch.—The passage is decisive; ( T.) *he slept and he made know to the king, and shewed him the end of his life, and* *he lifted up his voice from the earth, in prophecy*, &c. Those who have called in question the reality of Samuel’s apparition, seem not to have remembered this passage. H.—Yet his soul was not united to his body, (Salien) nor was he adduced by the power of the devil, but ( D.) by a just judgment of God, to denounce destruction to the wicked king. S. Aug. &c. T.—The woman, beholding Samuel, fled out of the place, to Saul’s companions, and left him alone with the king, v. 21.—*Adored* Samuel with an inferior honour, as a friend of God, exalted in glory. Salien.—That Samuel really appeared, is the more common opinion of the fathers. S. Aug. Cura. xv. W.  
**15** *Up.* To inform a person of something very terrible, is distressing; and though the saints deceased cannot partake in the afflictions of mortals, yet we read that “the angels of peace will weep, but they will approve of the just sentence of the judge” against the reprobate. H.—The Scripture language conforms itself to the opinions of the people, who thought that such avocations disturbed the soul’s repose. Hence the fathers at Elvira (C. 31) forbid “the lighting of wax candles in church-yards during the day, for the spirits of the saints are not to be disquieted.” Isaias (14:9,) represents hell all in commotion, at the approach of the king of Babylon. These expressions are figurative. C.—God does not encourage magical arts, on this occasion, but rather prevents their operation, as he did, when Balaam would have used some superstitious practices. Num. 24. D.  
**16** *Rival.* How vain is it to expect that a prophet can give an answer when the Lord is silent! Heb. “is become thy enemy.” H.  
**17** *To thee.* Heb. “to him.” This was only a repetition of what Samuel had before denounced. C. 15:28. If the evil spirit spoke this, he was not guilty of falsehood, nor more than Mat. 8:29. C.—But would he dare so often to repeat the name of the *Lord?* H.—Could he know what would happen to Saul, &c. the next day? W.  
**19** *To-mo* *rrow.* Usher supposes some days afterwards. But all might take place the day after this was spoken. C.—*Sons*, except Isboseth, who enjoyed, for a time, part of his father’s kingdom. H.—*With me.* That is, in the state of the dead, and in another world, though not in the same place. Ch.—Saul was guilty of suicide, so that he could not be with Samuel in happiness, (C. 31:4. T.) though he was in the other world. W.—See S. Aug. ad Simp. ii. 3. Cura pro mort. c. xv. S. Justin. Dial. Origen, &c.  
**20** *Day*, through excessive anguish. H.—He fainted away; upon which his attendants and the woman rushed in. Salien.  
**21** *Hand*, in the most imminent danger. See Judg. 12:3.  
**24** *Calf*, destined for a victim or feast. Luke 15:23. Prov. 15:17. C.—The generosity of this woman deserves commendation. Josep. vi. 15. H.

## Chapter 29

**1** *Aphec* *.* Hence they proceeded to Sunam, and attacked Saul, near the *fountain*, which were all places in the vale of *Jezrahel.* The sacred writer thus leaves the two armies ready to engage, being intent on giving the particulars of David’s history, and only relating the affairs of Saul, &c. in as much as they may refer to him. C.—David had retired from the army of the Philistines before Saul went to Endor, and some of the tribe of Manasses went after him, and were present in the battle, in which the Amalecites were slain and plundered. 1 Par. 12:19. Salien.  
**2** *Thousands*, making the troops pass in review, as the Hebrew insinuates. Their army seems to have been divided, in the same manner as that of the Israelites, each company of 10, 50, &c. having its respective officer, under the five lords.—*Were.* Heb. “passed.” David’s band was connected with the troops of Achis, yet so that they might be easily distinguished by their dress, &c. C.—The Roman *Triarii*, who were esteemed the bravest soldiers, occupied the rear. M.—Josephus gives us to understand that Achis was the commander in chief. Ant. vi. 14. T.  
**3** *Know David.* It seems they were not unacquainted with him, since they knew that Achis had given him a *place*, (v. 4,) or city. H.—But they prudently judged that it would be very hazardous to employ him on this occasion. Providence thus brought him honourably out of the scrape, as he could not have remained even inactive, among the troops of the Philistines, without rendering himself suspected both to them and to his own people. C.—*Years.* Abulensis thinks that Achis told an untruth, to persuade the lords that he had been long witness of David’s fidelity. He might also allude to the first time, when he came to his court, or the four months specified C. 27:9, might fall into different years. Sept. “he has been with us days, this is the second year.” M.—Syr. “two years (Arab. “one year,”) and some months.” C.—The true term was only four months. W.  
**4** **Ver** **.** **4** **.** *Adversary.* Heb. Satan, “a calumniator, enemy,” &c. C.—Tacitus (Hist. iv.) speaking of the Batavian corps, says, “which, being bribed, pretended to be faithful, that it might flee, and become more acceptable after it had betrayed the Romans in the heat of the engagement.”  
**6** *Lord.* Heb. Jehova. H.—Achis speaks of the true God, as David was accustomed to do. Salien.—Perhaps he adored him, like his other gods; as the Israelites are accused of swearing by the Lord and by Melchom. Soph. 1:5.—The pagans often appealed to the gods of those with whom they were treating. C.  
**8** *King.* He speaks thus that he might not increase the suspicions of the Philistines. M.—In the mean time, God called him to fight against Amalec, and to defend his own property, which was actually, or the next day, taken from Siceleg; ( H.) so that nothing could have been more desirable to him, than to be thus dismissed with applause. Salien.  
**9** *Angel of God*, equally incapable of any meanness. The pagans admitted the existence of good and of evil spirits. Sanctius. This exaggerated compliment occurs, Gen. 33:10. 2 K. 14:17 and 19:27.  
**10** *Thy Lord.* He may allude to Saul, (v. 3,) or to himself, (C. 5:8,) or to God, as David was under obligations to all three. H.—*Light*, that none might know or be dejected, in the rest of the army. M.

## Chapter 30

**1** *Day.* It was distant from Aphec about 90 miles.—*Smitten*, yet without killing any. C.—We may adore a merciful Providence, which prevented these barbarians from treating David’s men as he had treated theirs. C. 27:11. Salien, A.C. 1074.—He would allow them to burn the city, &c. that David might be roused to execute the divine vengeance upon them. Theodoret.  
**4** *Tears.* Heb. “till they had no more power to weep.” M.—See Lament. 2:11. Cicero exclaims, *Hei mihi! consumptis enim lachrymis, infixus tamen hæret in corde dolor* *.* Phil. 2.  
**6** *Stone him*, as the author of all their losses, because he had not left a sufficient garrison at Siceleg, and had irritated the Amalecites. Inconstant people! they thought that he we indebted to them for all that he possessed! C.—David, without being too much dejected, sought out for an immediate remedy, and led them on to battle. Their ancestors had once threatened to stone Moses. Ex. 17. &c. T.  
**7** *To David.* Some think that David put on the ephod; but this was the function of the high priest, who, according to Grotius, turned towards David, that he might see the brightness of the precious stones. See Ex. 28:30. By means of the priest David was enlightened. W.  
**9** *Besor* is formed by the water falling from the mountains of Idumea, and discharges itself into the Mediterranean, below Gaza. C.—Some take it to be the torrent of the desert, or the river of Egypt. Adrichomius makes it run from the mountains of Juda, so as to form the southern boundary of the tribe of Simeon. H.  
**10** *Weary.* Heb. pigru, denotes those who are “lazy and dead.” Sept. “some sat down on the other side of the torrent.” Syr. and Arab. insinuate, to defend the passage. But why then do the rest complain? C.—They acted irrationally, as David shewed afterwards. Some of the 600 might well be more exhausted than others, and these were selected to guard the baggage, v. 24. This was only the third day since they left Aphec, v. 1. H.  
**12** *R* *aisins.* Heb. tsimmukim. See C. 25:18. C.—The soldiers very prudently took some provisions with them, as they were going into a desert country. M.  
**13** *Ago.* His master’s inhumanity was justly punished, and God provided for the safety of his poor slave, while he sent a guide for David. H.  
**14** *Cerethi*, denotes the Philistines, (R. David. See v. 16. H.) who came originally from Crete. 2 K. 15:18. Ezec. 25:16. C.—They might be natives of some province of the Philistines, (Vatab.) belonging to Gaza, ( M.) or Geth. H.—*Caleb.* Hebron and Cariath-sepher fell to his share. The enemy had a good opportunity to ravage all those places, as most of the soldiers were absent ( C.) at Jezrahel. H.  
**15** *Him.* David did not require this slave to betray his master, for the latter had lost all his claim, and David had acquired it by relieving the distressed. *Si herus negaverit servo suo alimenta, & alius suppeditet, sit occupantis* *.* See Martyr. and the Roman laws. The Amalecites dwelt in tents, and the slave knew where they commonly lodged. C.—Perhaps his master had told him where to meet him, in case he recovered.  
**16** *Drinking.* Heb. adds, “and dancing,” (Salien) in honour of their gods.  
**17** *Evening.* Heb. “twilight,” in the morning ( C.) or evening. H.—Some think that the pursuit lasted three days; others only from three till five in the evening. But David more probably slaughtered the intoxicated people, during the space of a whole day, from morning till evening. C.—Sept. “from the morning *or* evening star rising, αρο εωσφορου, till the afternoon, and on the following day,” ( H.) which commenced at sun-set. C.—It was no battle, but flight and carnage. M.  
**19** *All*, excepting what had been eaten, or consumed with fire. M.  
**20** *And made.* Heb. “*which* they drove before those things (*or* cattle,” taken from the Amalecites. H.) “which were separated from those which David had recovered.” Each one reclaimed what he had lost. Perhaps David’s portion was placed by itself. C.—Grotius thinks that, as the things taken in war cannot be reclaimed by the former proprietors, all was equally divided. See Seld. Jur. vi. 16.  
**22** *Unjust.* Heb. Belial*.* See Deut. 13:13. C.—David saluted those who had remained at Besor, to shew that he approved of their conduct, unless we may attribute it to his great clemency. M.  
**24** *Alike.* Nothing could be more just and prudent; as this decision prevents continual murmurs and inconveniences. Those who are left behind, are bound to defend the baggage at the hazard of their lives, and each man must obey the orders of the general. Hence all nations seem to have adopted similar regulations, though Achilles declaims against it. Iliad i.—Coriolanus observes, that formerly the Romans brought all the spoil into the public treasury. Halicar. vii.—The soldiers promised on oath to bring all they should take, and an equal division was made to the whole army. Polyb. x.—The sick and absent also partook of the plunder. C.—The same was observed by the Machabees, 2 B. 8:28. H.  
**25** *A law.* Custom, ( C.) and a particular injunction, had long before made way for it. Num. 31:27. H. Jos. 22:8.—We might translate the Heb. “And this law had been observed in Israel from that day and before.” David restored to its full vigour this ancient regulation. The Hebrews have no compound verbs, such as re-establish, re-build, &c. instead of which, they say, to establish, ( C.) and build again. Thus, by the addition of adverbs, they can explain the same things. Prot. “from that day forward he made it a statute,” &c. H.—It is not, therefore, unlawful to make new laws, provided they be conformable to those of God. Deut. 4 and 12. W.  
**26** *Neighbours.* Heb. “friends;” some were at a distance, v. 28. H.—The number of presents shews the quantity of the spoil, and the generosity of David towards those who had formerly assisted him. C.  
**27** *Bethel*, “the house of God,” as the priests had afforded him protection. H.—It is not certain whether he speaks of a town of Ephraim, or of the cities where the ark and the tabernacle were now fixed.—Ramoth, in the tribe of Simeon: ( C.) there was another in the tribe of Gad. M.—*Jether*, or “Jethira,” (Euseb.) a priests’ town, called *Ether.* Jos. 15:42.  
**28** *Aroer*, on the Arnon. David had sojourned among the Moabites.—*Sephamoth* *:* perhaps *Sephama*, (Num. 34:10,) though it was a great way beyond the Jordan. C.—Abulensis assigns Sephamoth to Juda. M.—*Esthamo* was in the same tribe, belonging to the priests. Jos. 21:14.  
**29** *Rachel;* perhaps the same with Hachila. C. 23:19. and 26:1.—*Jerameel* *.* See C. 27:10.—*Ceni*, a canton to the south of the Dead Sea.  
**30** *Arama*, or *Horma.* Num. 21:3.—*Lake.* Heb. “at Chor Aschan.” It is called Asan, Jos. 15:42, and 19:7.—*Athach*, or *Athar* *.* Jos. 19:7.  
**31** **Ver** **.** **31** **.** *Hebron*, twenty miles south of Jerusalem.—*Rest.* David remunerated all his old friends, which was the sure way to procure more. H.—He was still uncertain what would be the event of the war between Saul and the Philistines; and desirous to make friends, who might smooth his way to the throne, according to God’s appointment. Salien.

## Chapter 31

**1** *Fled.* They make but a feeble resistance, as God was not with them. H.—The first onset was made by the archers, and Saul’s three sons fell, while the king himself was dangerously wounded. C.—The death of his sons would increase his anguish. M.—He seems not to have told them of the divine decree, as he might deem it irrevocable and unavoidable, so that flight would have been of no service to them. H.  
**2** *Jonathan.* Ven. Bede, &c. doubt not of his salvation. Salien.  
**3** *Overtook.* Heb. “attacked, found, *or* hit him.” He was running away. H.—*Wounded.* Some translate Heb. “terrified,” as they believe the words of the Amalecite, “my whole life is in me.” But that wretch deserves no credit; and Saul would probably not take the desperate resolution of killing himself, till he saw there was no possibility of escaping. Sept. “the archers find him, and they wounded him in the lower belly.” Theodotion, “in the part near the liver.”  
**4** *Bearer.* The Rabbins say he was Doeg. They were not yet come to a close engagement.—*Mock at me*, as was then customary. See Jos. 8:29. Judg. 1:7. He might recollect the treatment of Samson. C.—*Fear.* “To spill the royal blood’s a direful thing.” Homer.  
**5** *With him.* Thus to avoid a little shame and temporal punishment, they rushed into those which are inconceivably geat and eternal. H.—The Jews in vain attempt to excuse Saul, as they deem suicide in such cases lawful, though in others they deprive those of burial, who have been guilty of it. Joseph. Ant. vi. 14.—This author applauds the behaviour of Saul; and indeed, his courage called forth the praises of David. But even the pagans have deemed those no better than cowards, who have killed themselves to avoid misery.  
**6** *His men.* Paral. *his house fell together.* The hopes of his family were at an end, ( H.) though Isboseth, Abner, and some few survived him, ( M.) who had fled, ( C.) or had not been in the engagement. H.  
**7** *Beyond*, or about “the passage” or fords of the Jordan, as the Heb. means. M.—The Philistines did not pursue after them, as God set bounds to their ambition. It might otherwise have proved very fatal to his people, who were now so much divided and terrified. In the parallel passage, in Chronicles, it is only said, *When the men … th* *at dwelt in the plains* (of Jezrahel) *saw this, they fled.* 1 Par. 10:7. The Philistines seized the abandoned cities, particularly Bethsan, (v. 10. H.) which had been retained by the Chanaanites in the days of the judges, and which David took back. Judg. 1:27. 3 K. 4:12.  
**9** *Head*, as David had treated that of Goliath. C. 17:54.  
**10** *Astaroth* *.* The like custom was observed by the Hebrew, (C. 21:9,) and by the Greeks and Romans, ( C.) to acknowledge that victory was granted by God. The Philistines insulted Saul’s body, and blasphemed the true God, as much as if they had taken the king alive. He only avoided the mortification of hearing them while he was forced to attend to the furies below.—*Body*, with those of his three sons, v. 12. H.—Saul’s head was hung up in the temple of Dagon, at Azotus; (1 Par. 10:10,) his body was suspended on the *wall* or *street of Bethsan;* (2 K. 21:12,) or in the most public place, near the gate of the city.  
**11** *Jabes*, in gratitude for the deliverance which he had procured for them. C. 11:11. C.—They are also deserving of praise for shewing mercy to the dead, as well as for their bravery. W.  
**12** *Burnt them*, or the flesh, reserving the ashes and bones to be buried, as was customary among the Greeks (Homer, ψ.) and Romans:  
**13** *Wood.* Par. *under the oak.*—*Days*, at their own option. David fasted one day, ( C.) as he did for Abner. Salien.—There was no obligation of mourning for the kings, though it is probable that those near the royal city, would shew this mark of attention to the deceased monarch. See Jer. 34:5. 2 Par. 35:25. The usual term of mourning was seven days. Eccli. 22:13. C.—It is very difficult to ascertain the length of Saul’s reign. Sanctius and Tirin allow him only 2 years; Petau 12; Calvisius 15; Salien 18; Bucholeer, and probably Josephus, 20, though most copies of the latter have 38; S. Aug. Serarius, Usher, &c. 40, which is the term mentioned Acts 13:20. But most chronologers suppose that the time of Samuel’s administration is there also included. H.—Sulpitius thinks that Saul only “reigned a very short time,” as “the ark was brought to Cariathiarim before the appeared on the throne, and was removed by David, after it had been there twenty years.”
