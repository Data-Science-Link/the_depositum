## Chapter 1

**2** *Offer*, voluntarily, without any command. Some sacrifices were of precept. Ex. 22:29. M.—These first chapters are addressed to the people; the 6th from v. 9, to the priests. Oxen, goats, and sheep, pigeons, and turtles, were to be offered in sacrifice, and small birds also, in the purification of lepers, (C. 14:4,) as they might easily be procured. C.—By sacrifice, we testify the dominion of God over all. They were offered by the patriarchs, and by all nations. God requireth that the victim should be without blemish, and slain with certain ceremonies wisely ordained. Ps. 103:24. W.—*A sacrifice.*Hebrew*korban*, a present of any sort. Mark 7.—*Sheep and goats*, v. 10. The same term,*tson*, signifies both. M.  
**3** *A holocaust.*That is, a whole burnt-offering; (olocauston) so called, because the whole victim was consumed with fire; and given in such manner to God as wholly to evaporate, as it were, for his*honour and glory;*without having any part of it reserved for the use of man. The other sacrifices of the Old Testament were either*offerings for sin*, or*peace-offerings:*and these latter again were either offered in*thanksgiving*for blessing received, or by way of*p**rayer*for new favours or graces. So that sacrifices were then offered to God for four different ends or intentions, answerable to the different obligations which man has to God: 1. By way of adoration, homage, praise, and glory, due to his divine Majesty. 2. By way of thanksgiving for all benefits received from him. 3. By way of confessing and craving pardon for sins. 4. By way of prayer and petition for grace an relief in all necessities. In the New Law we have but one sacrifice, viz. that of the body and blood of Christ: but this one sacrifice of the New Testament perfectly answers all these four ends; and both priests and people, as often as it is celebrated, ought to join in offering it up for these four ends. Ch. S. Aug. de C. D. viii. 17. S. Chrys. in Ps. 95.—*We have an altar*, (Heb. 13:10,) on which the unbloody sacrifice is offered, (Matt. 26:25,) as the blood of Christ was on the cross. Heb. 9:25. W.  
**4** *Victim.*To transfer all the curses due to him upon it, (Eus. Demon. i. 10,) and to testify that he gives it up entirely for the honour of God. Lyran.—The Egyptians cut off the head of the victim, and vented upon it imprecations, begging that the gods would discharge upon it all the evils which they had deserved. Then they sold it to some foreigner, or threw it into the Nile. Herod. ii. 39. All nations seem to have acknowledged, that life would be given for life.*Han**c animam vobis pro veliore damus**:*(Ovid Fast. i.) and they had holocausts, in imitation of the Hebrews. Bochart.—*Expiation.*Heb. “it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him,” provided he be in proper dispositions. M.—The primary intention of the holocaust was to honour God: but this insured his favour also, and pardon. D.  
**5** *He*, by the hands of the priests, (C. 10:1,) as the Sept. express it, “they shall immolate;” ( M.) though we might infer from this text, that the person who offered the victim, had to slay it; ( C.) while the priests alone could pour the blood upon and around the altar.*Without the effusion of blood remission is not made.*Heb. 9:22. H.  
**6** *They.*Regularly the Levites performed this office. The skin belonged to the priest. C. 7:8. C.  
**7** *Fire.*Heb. and Sept. place the fire first, then the wood. It was the sacred fire which was never extinguished, but removed from the altar in marches, (C. 4:13,) perhaps in a censer or pan. H.  
**8** *All things*, &c. Heb.pador, may signify the*fat*, or the*trunk*of the animal. C.  
**9** *Sweet.*Not that the Deity can take delight in sweet odours; but he is pleased with the devotion of men. For their advancement in piety, he required these sacrifices; 1. to keep the people from idolatry; 2. to teach them to consecrate their body and effects to him, as well as their souls,*to serve justice unto sanctificat**ion;*(Rom. 6:19. Jo. 4:24,) as without the help of exterior observances, the mind will hardly rise to the contemplation of truth; 3. to prefigure the greater mysteries of the Christian religion, of which the law was only a shadow, incapable of conferring justifying*grace.*Jo. 1:17. Gal. 3:11. W.—*The law was our pedagogue, in Christ, that we might be justified by faith*, v. 24.  
**10** *Male.*Lyranus seems to have read “a year old,” in the Vulg. But it is not found in the Heb. or in any version. It may have been taken from Exod. 12:5, where the paschal*lamb*must be*a male of one year.*—*Blemish.*The Sept. add, “and he shall put his hand upon its head.” H.  
**14** *Pigeons.*Heb. and Sept. say nothing about the age; though the Rabbins assure us, that old turtles and young pigeons were to be immolated, as being more excellent. God requires only what each person may easily procure. This third species of holocaust was chiefly intended for the poor. C. 12:8. But if they could not afford even this, they might offer flour. C. 2.  
**15** *The neck.*Some say, without pulling the head off (Grotius); which the Rabbins deny. C.  
**16** *Throat.*Heb.mierath, is rendered “the crop and its contents,” by the Chal. Syr. and Sam.  
**17** *Pinions*, as if it were to be roasted. Eusebius remarks, that the pagans plunged their birds into the sea, then poured the blood round the altar, and afterwards burnt them. Abram did not divide the birds. Gen. 15:10. C.—*Oblation.*Heb. “made by fire;” or which must be all consumed, except the crop and feathers. H.

## Chapter 2

**1** *One*, (anima). The*soul*is put to denote the whole person.—*Of sacrifice.*Heb.mincha, which is applied to inanimate things, particularly to flour, “a present of wheat.” Vatable.—As the other sacrifices have peculiar names, this is barely called sacrifice by the Vulg. It was instituted, 1. for the poor; 2. to support the ministers of religion; 3. to shew that God was to be honoured with the fruits of the earth; 4. sacrifice being intended as a sort of feast, bread, salt, wine, and oil accompany it; and also incense, which was almost solely reserved for God. M.—The person who offered the sacrifice, had to furnish all things belonging to it. The Sam. and Sept. add at the end of this verse, “Behold what is the offering of the Lord.” Similar words occur, (v. 6 and 16,) in Heb. Sacrifices of flour were the most ancient of all. Ovid (Fast. ii.) says,*Farra tamen veteres jaciebant, farra metebant*, &c. “Numa taught the people to worship the gods with fruits and flour, and to make supplication with a salted cake.” (Plin. xviii. 2.)*Fruge deos colere, & molâ salsâ supplicare**.*C.  
**2** *Memorial.*“To worship and celebrate the name of God.” Louis de Dieu.  
**3** *Holy of hol**ies.*That is,*most holy;*as being dedicated to God, and set aside by his ordinance for the use of his priests. Ch.—All was to be eaten or consumed in the tabernacle. The high priest offered a gomor full of flour and oil, rather baked, every day. C. 6:20. C.  
**9** *Out of.*The handful, which shall be burnt, shall cause God to remember and grant the request of the offerer, equally as if the whole were consumed. M.  
**11** *Without leaven or honey.*Noleavenor*honey*was to be used in the sacrifice offered to God: to signify that we are to exclude from the pure worship of the gospel, all double-dealing and affection to carnal pleasures. Ch.—The prohibition of leaven regarded these sacrifices. It was offered with the first-fruits, (C. 23:17,) and perhaps also in peace-offerings. C. 7:13. Honey is here rejected, as incompatible with the other ingredients, to admonish us to lead a penitential life, and to keep at a greater distance from the customs of the pagans, who generally accompanied their oblations with honey. Ezec. 16:18. Herodotus (B. ii.) says, the Egyptians used honey in sacrifice. C.—By unleavened bread, the Hebrews were reminded of their flight out of Egypt; and by refraining from honey, they were taught to act like men. M.  
**12** *First-fruits*, &c. to be voluntarily given to the priest, in honour of God. The honey arising from the dates might also be offered.—It was little inferior to that of bees. Josep. Bel. v. 3. See Num. 15:19.  
**13** *Salt.*In every sacrifice salt was to be used, which is an emblem of*wisdom*and*discretion*, without which none of our performances are agreeable to God. Ch.—Salt is not prescribed in the sacrifices of animals. But it was to be used in them, as we learn from the Jews, and from S. Mark 9:48.*Every victim shall be salted.*The ancient poets never specify salt in their descriptions of sacrifices. But Pliny assures us, that in his time it was of the greatest authority, and always used in sacrifice, with cakes.*Maxime in sacris**intelligebatur salis auctoritas, quando nulla conficiuntur sine molâ salsâ**.*B. xxxi. 7.—*Covenant.*It is so called, because it was a symbol of the durable condition of the alliance with God, which was renewed in every sacrifice; ( C.) or it may signify “the salt prescribed” by God: for the law and covenant are often used synonymously. M.—*Let your speech be always in grace, seasoned with salt.*Col. 4:6. See Num. 18:19.  
**14** *And break*, &c. Heb. has simply, “corn beaten out (*or*ready to be beaten out) of full ears.” H.—These were to be offered at the Passover. D.

## Chapter 3

**1** *Peace-offerings. Peace*, in the Scripture language, signifies happiness, welfare, or prosperity; in a word, all kinds of blessings. Such sacrifices, therefore, as were offered either on occasion of blessings received, or to obtain new favours, were called*pacific*or*peace-offerings.*In these some part of the victim was consumed with fire on the altar of God: other parts were eaten by the priests, and the persons for whom the sacrifice was offered. Ch.—Female beasts might here be sacrificed, but not birds. The victims were either offered to praise God for past favours, or to comply with some vow, or were perfectly free. C. 7:12. Three sorts of victims, the ox, the sheep, and the goat, denoted all those who*served*God in innocence, or in the state of penance. D. Of these sacrifices “of the perfect,” none of the unclean could taste. C. 7:20. When only flour or bread was given, the donor received no part again.  
**2** *Which shall.*Heb. “which he gives, he shall slay it … the priests shall pour,” &c. Yet some assert, that laymen were not allowed to approach the altar.  
**3** *Fat.*All the fat was carefully presented to the Lord. The Persians offered this alone.*Oment**um in flamma pingue liquefaciens**.*Catul. Epig. de Magis.  
**4** *Flanks.*S. Jerom sometimes translates the Heb.loins, as the Sept. and Sym. do; (Ps. 37:7) and this Bochart believes is the most proper signification. C.—*Two*is not specified in the Latin, nor*little*in the Hebrew.  
**5** *For a.*Some translate, “upon the,” others “after the burnt-sacrifice;” as if that were always to be offered first, every day. C.—But is seems that the peace-offering was an imitation of the holocaust, with respect to the fat, caul, and kidneys, which were to be entirely consumed. H.  
**8** *It.*Heb. and Sept. “he shall slay,” v. 2, 13. C.  
**9** *Whole rump.*Sept. “the loin without blemish.” The tail of the Arabian sheep is extremely large and fat, weighing eight or ten pounds; so that it is necessary to support it on a vehicle. Busbecq. ep. 3. The tail was not sacrificed in any other species. M.  
**10** *With*, &c. Heb. “and the two kidneys with their fat by the flanks, and the great lobe of the liver, above the kidneys, shall they take.” H.—All our affections must be consecrated to God, and our passions kept under. D.  
**11** *Food*, destined for the honour of God, and to be consumed by*fire.*In other places, God calls these sacrifices*his food*, and the altar his*table.*C. 21:21. Mal. 1:7. 12.  
**17** *Fat.*It is meant of the fat, which by the prescription of the law was to be offered on God’s altar: not of the fat of meat, such as we commonly eat. Ch.—This distinction is sufficiently insinuated; (C. 7:25,) whence it also appears that the fat, here forbidden, is only that, which, in all sacrifices, appertains to the Lord, v. 9, 10. The fat which was intermingled with the flesh might be eaten, and even the rest if the animal was not sacrificed. God repeatedly forbade the use of*blood.*C. 17:13. Yet the Jews abstain from the*fat*also of all oxen, sheep, and goats; (Josep. iii. 10,) and some, adhering to the words of this text, forbid the use of fat indiscriminately. C.—A Lapide condemns it, if the animal might be offered in sacrifice, though it were slain at home.

## Chapter 4

**2** *Ignorance.*To be ignorant of what we are bound to know is sinful: and for such culpable ignorance, these sacrifices, prescribed in this and the following chapter, were appointed. Ch.—*Not to be done.*Hence the Rabbins admit sins of ignorance, only against the negative precepts. But when God forbids one thing, he commands the contrary; and we may sin by ignorance against any of his ordinances. If the ignorance be voluntary, it enhances the crime; and Aristotle well observes that drunkards, who do an injury, are to be doubly punished, because their fault is voluntary in its cause, (ad Nicom. iii. 7). But if the ignorance were perfectly involuntary, and inculpable, no sacrifice was required; so that God here speaks only of that sort of ignorance which involved some degree of negligence. This fault could not be forgiven without interior good dispositions. The sacrifice only reached to*the cleansing of the flesh*, (Heb. 9:13,) or to screen the culprit from the severity of the law and of the magistrates; ( C.) though they might help the inward dispositions of the heart, and thus contribute to obtain God’s pardon. Orig. S. Aug. q. 20. The difference between*peccatum*and*d**elictum*, is not perfectly ascertained. Some think the former word denotes sins of malice, and the latter those of ignorance. Tirinus maintains the contrary, as a more costly sacrifice, he says, is required for the latter. H.  
**3** *Anointed.*That is, “the high priest.” Sept. Inferior priests were not anointed, except the sons of Aaron, at the beginning. C.—Ignorance in such a one is greatly to be avoided, as it tends to scandalize the people. H.—The same ceremonies are prescribed, as on the day of expiation; only the priest did not enter the most holy place.—*Offend*, in some smaller matter. If he engaged his brethren in the crime of idolatry, he should die. Deut. 13:15. C.—Before the solemn unction, he might be expiated, like one of the princes. M.  
**3** *Calf.*Heb.par, does not specify the age. C.  
**5** *The blood.*As the figure of the*blood*of Christ shed for the remission of our sins; and carried by him into the sanctuary of heaven.  
**6** *Seven.*A number consecrated in Scripture, ( C.) and not superstitious. W.—Apuleius (Met. xi.) mentions it.*Septies submerso fluctibus capite**.*C.—*Sanctuary*, or most holy place. M.  
**12** *Ashes*of the victims. They were first laid beside the altar of holocausts. By this ceremony, the priest begged that his sins might be removed from the sight of God, ( M.) by virtue of Christ’s sacrifice, who suffered out of the gate of Jerusalem. Heb. 13:13. The high priest was obliged to offer this sacrifice himself, to expiate his own sin, as well as that of the people. Heb. 9:7.  
**13** *Multitude*assembled. Sept. add, “be involuntarily ignorant, and no one of the congregation perceive the truth, (*or*word,) and shall transgress, by commission or omission, one of all the precepts of the Lord.” Such was the offence of Saul and the people. 1 K. 14:33. On these occasions, the elders were to put their hands on the victim, to acknowledge the general offence, if it were not of too heinous a nature to be expiated by sacrifice. See Deut. 13:12.  
**22** **Ve****r.****22****.***A prince.*King, magistrate, general, chief of a tribe, or great family; in a word, one*elevated*above the rest (*Nasi*); as appears, Num. 1:4. 7:2.  
**24** *He.*Sam. and Sept. read, “they shall have,” referring it to the priests.  
**26** *Him.*Moses does not here specify what was to be done with the flesh. But (C. 6:26,) he commands it to be given to the priests. C.—In the sacrifices for the sins of the multitude, or of the priest, all was consumed; to express a greater detestation of such offences, ( T.) and that the priests might derive no benefit from them. Theod. q. 3. S. Tho. i. 2. q. 102. a. 3. W.—Those who offered these victims received no part of them again, nor were oil or incense used; as all delicacies must be rejected by penitents. T.  
**27** *The land.*A rustic or plebeian. M.—The offences of such might be expiated by the sacrifice of a goat, ewe, lamb, ram, two pigeons, or flour. C. 5:7. 11:15. C.  
**29** *Of*, &c. One Heb. MS. the Sept. and Syriac read, “in the place in which he shall slay the holocaust.” The Sam. has*they slay*, both here and v. 24 and 33, which seems the truer reading. Kennicott.  
**35** *For a.*Heb. may be “according to, like ( H.) upon, besides, after the holocausts.” C. See C. 3:5.

## Chapter 5

**1** *Swearing.*We are accountable for the sins of others, to which we are accessory, as appears from this and part of the following chapter. No distinction of persons is here noticed. If any one, therefore, be witness to another’s promise, confirmed by oath, and, being cited to the bar, refuse to speak, he shall be guilty of sin, and offer the sacrifice proscribed (v. 6,) for all the preceding cases. Restitution must also be made to the injured person. M.—But others suppose that no sacrifice was allowed for such an obstinate wretch as when not answered when the judge*swore*or adjured him. He was liable to be put to death. The associate of the thief fell under the like punishment as the thief himself, when he would not reveal the theft to the judge. Prov. 29:24. Others again understand this*swearing*to mean blaspheming God. If the hearer do not reprehend him, he shall suffer as his accomplice. Orig. Philo.—Junius thinks that the neglect of fraternal correction, was to be expiated by the sacrifice prescribed for the sins of ignorance, concerning which Moses is treating. But it seems that the person here mentioned was to die, as the words*he shall bear his iniquity*, commonly denote. C. 19:8. &c. C.—When perjury prejudiceth another’s cause, we are bound to reveal what we know to the judge, if it can be done so as to avoid scandal. W.—*Not.*Hebrew editions read*loa*, instead ofla, both here and in 34 other places; an irregularity unknown in some MSS. and to the Samaritan copy. Perhaps it may have been occasioned bylu, “to him,” being of the same sound with*la.*Kennic.  
**2** *Beast.*All wild beasts were deemed unclean; but domestic clean cattle, though slain, did not defile; ( C.) while some of the unclean did, even alive. C. 11:26. 31. H.—Fishes are comprised under the name*reptiles;*yet some were not unclean. C. 11:9. The Sept. neglect*reptiles*, and put “the carcasses of impure abominations;” by which they probably mean dogs, and such things as the Egyptians adored. This verse does not regard those who had only touched something unclean, as such were to be purified at night, by washing their garments; but it refers to those who, having neglected that ordinance, had still ventured to touch something sacred, and were therefore required to offer the sacrifice,assom, ( C.) as for an irreligious behaviour towards God. T.  
**3** *Of man*, who may be in a state of legal uncleanness. If he neglect or forget to purify himself, he must offer a sacrifice, either such as he may choose, (S. Aug. q. 2.) or such as the priest may require. Lyran. C.  
**4** *Li**ps.*This is necessary before he can be punished by men; but every secret promise binds before God. Tostat.—*Evil or good:*any thing whatsoever, whether favour or punishment, whether the completion of it be difficult or easy. C.—Thus parents sometimes foolishly swear that they will chastise their children unmercifully; libertines that they will live in luxuries as long as they have any money; ill-natured people that they will never speak to such a one, that they will murder, &c. To execute such promises, even confirmed by an oath, would be a double crime. Let them ask pardon of God for their rash oath. Philo.—Herod made his oath a pretext for killing the Baptist, deluding himself, perhaps, with a false interpretation of this law. H.—As such hasty oaths are easily forgotten, when the guilty person recollected himself, he was bound to confess his fault to the priest in the following manner, according to the Rabbins: Placing his hands between the horns of his victim, he shall say, “I beseech you, Lord, I have sinned; I have committed iniquity and prevarication; I have committed such a fault. I repent, I am filled with sorrow and confusion for having done so; I will relapse no more.” These doctors teach, that without confession and sorrow no sacrifice will remit sin. C.—To preserve the*secret*of confession, the priests were ordered to eat the victims*alone.*Philo. &c. T.  
**5** *Let*, &c. Heb. “and surely when he is guilty in one of these things, he shall confess that he hath sinned therein; (6) and he shall bring his sin-offering unto the Lord, for his transgression,” &c. Confession to the priest was requisite, before all the other sacrifices for sin. See Josep. iii. 10. H.  
**9** *Sin.*The flesh belonged to the priest. C. 6:26.  
**11** *Ephi*, or a gomor, which is the tenth part of three pecks and three pints, English. Arbuthnot.—*For sin*, and therefore to shew how odious sin is to God, he will not allow any frankincense to be offered. M.  
**12** *Memorial.*See C. 2:2. At the end, the Heb. and Sept. add, “It is a sin-offering;”*peccatum**.*C.—Hence the priests are said to eat the*sins*of the people, Osee 4:8.  
**15** *The ceremonies:*omitted in Heb. and Sept.—*Sanctified*, neglecting to pay the first-fruits; or, by mistake, eating any of the victims reserved for God, or for the priests.—*Two sicles.*S. Jerom seems to have read in the dual number, whereas the Hebrew pointed copies have sicles indefinitely; and the Rabbins understand two, when the word is plural and undetermined. Theodoret reads fifty, which some maintain is the ancient translation of the Sept. though it is not found in any of our copies. Hebrew may be rendered “a ram (or) according to thy estimation, sicles of silver.” The particle*or*is sometimes understood. It is probable that when the fault was considerable, a ram was to be sacrificed, and restitution made of what was due with the fifth part besides; but if the fault was small, the priest determined how many sicles were to be presented for sacred purposes.—*Sanctuary.*See Ex. 30:13.  
**17** *Through ignorance.*These words are not found in the Heb. or Sept.; but the context shews, that they must be understood. Some pretend that the ignorance here spoken of, is that by which a person*doubts*whether the thing which he touched was unclean or not. But we may explain these last verses as a recapitulation of what had been already ordered. C.  
**18** *Sin.*If it were grievous, the priest required a more valuable victim, 5:15.  
**19** *Lord.*Heb. “It is a victim for the sin which he has committed against the Lord.” From this chapter, as well as from Num. 5:7, it is obvious that a special confession was necessary, not only for those who had fallen into the disorder of leprosy, which was a figure of sin, and often inflicted by God in punishment of it; but also, when they had given way to the smallest transgression against the commands and ceremonies of the Lord. H.—This custom is still observed by the Jews. Galatinus x. 3.

## Chapter 6

**2** *Despising:*interpretatively; not formally, as Num. 15. Estius.—*The Lord*, who knows the truth, and is an avenger of all injustice, even the most secret. H.—The law inflicts indeed a smaller punishment, as these offences are supposed to be secret, and the offender is thus invited to repent, and to repair the injury done. When the crime is public, the law is more severe. C.—Heb. “if a soul transgress and sin against the Lord.” Sept. “If any one wilfully despise the commands,” &c. H.—*Trust.*Heb. and Sept. “or a sum given for traffic for their common benefit.”—*Oppression*, by any means whatsoever, detaining the wages of the labourer, &c.  
**3** *Lost.*We acquire no title to the thing by finding it. The Roman law, as well as divines, condemn those who appropriate the thing found to their own use, as guilty of theft, whether they knew to whom it belonged or not; and Plato greatly commends the law of Solon,*“Take not what thou didst not put down,”*a rule which the Dyrbeans and the people of Biblos rigorously observed. We may, however, take up what is lost, ( C.) and endeavour to find the owner, who must indemnify us for our trouble; and, if we never find him, we are directed to give the price to the poor, for the owner’s welfare. H.  
**4** *Convicted*, by his own conscience, and by the judgment of the priest to whom he has confessed his sin. The Heb. expresses the different sorts of sins specified above, which the Vulgate denotes by the word*offence.*  
**5** *Wronged.*Heb. and Chaldee add, “in the day of his sin-offering;” and the Sept. “in which he has convicted.” No unnecessary delay in making restitution can be allowed to the sincere penitent, who wishes to make his peace with God.  
**6** *The.*Heb. “thy estimation for a sin-offering.” H.—Wilful sins require a more noble victim than those of ignorance, which were expiated by the sacrifice of a goat. M.  
**9** *Holocaust.*The regulations respecting it, as they regard the priests, are here given, as C. 1 directions were given to those who represent the victims.—*Morning.*All the parts of the victim were not laid on at the same time. The like was observed during the day also, when no other sacrifices were to be offered on this altar.—*Of the same*, not strange, unhallowed fire, but such as was kept continually burning on the altar of holocausts, as the Heb. intimates; “the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.” During the marches in the desert, it is not written how this fire was preserved. The Persians believed that their eternal fire came down from heaven, and the vestal virgins kept their sacred fire at Rome, with superstitious care. Theophrastus (ap. Euseb. præp. i. 9,) mentions the keeping of fire in the temples, as one of the most ancient rites of religion.  
**11** *Others;*such as were worn on common occasions, out of the tabernacle.—*And shall*, &c. Heb. has only, “unto a clean place,” as the other versions and some Latin copies read. The meaning of the addition is, that all the bones, &c. must be perfectly reduced to dust, before they be carried out of the camp. C.  
**12** *Fat*, along with the whole burnt-offering. M.  
**13** *The perpetual fire.*This fire came from heaven, (*i**nfra*chap. 9:24,) and was always kept burning on the altar: as a figure of the heavenly fire of divine love, which ought to be always burning in the heart of a Christian. Ch.—It must be fed by assiduous meditation on the Scripture and holy things. D.  
**14** *Sacrifice*of flour,*monee.*C. 2:1.—*And libations.*These words are added, to shew that oil and wine accompanied this sacrifice.  
**16** *He.*Only the priests, who were actually officiating, could partake of it. C.  
**18** Lord. As long as this law shall be enforced. M.—*Sanctified.*Theodoret (q. 5,) seems to assert, that all such were obliged to serve the altar in some function or other. If any unclean person touched the victims wilfully, he was slain; if, by mistake, the blood sprinkled a garment, it was to be washed, v. 27.  
**20** *Evening.*And this shall continue as long as they are high priests, from the day of their consecration, (Josep. iii. 20.; Cajetan,)*a perpetual sacrifice.*C.  
**22** *Rightfully.*According to the law, which decides that, if the first-born be deformed, the next shall succeed. C. 21:18. Heb. “the priest, of his sons, who is anointed in his stead, shall offer it.” No mention is made of its being*hot*, either here or in the Sept. H.  
**23** *Sacrifice*of flour, not of animals. Ex. 29:28.  
**25** *Sin*of individuals. The victims offered by the priest, or by the whole people, were to be burnt. C. 4:7.  
**26** *Tabernacle.*No part shall be given to those who are not of the sacerdotal race. C.  
**27** *Place*, in the court, that so it may be worn again. M.  
**28** *Sodden*, or boiled. Such vessels, of private people, as had been used to boil part of the victim, (1 K 2:13,) were either to be abandoned to the service of the altar, or*broken*, &c. C.—Earthen vessels might imbibe some part of the consecrated juice. M.  
**30** *Fire.*As they are the victims for the sins of the priest and of the people. C. 4:6. 18. M.

## Chapter 7

**1** *Trespass.*Trespasses, for which these offerings were to be made, were less offences, than those for which the sin-offerings were appointed. Ch.—*Delictum, trespass*, answers to the Heb.asham, and the Gr.plemmeleia;( H.) being of a more extensive signification that the Hebrew*chete, sin*, as it comprises even sins against knowledge. Parkhurst. See C. 4:2.—No particular ceremonies are enjoined, (v. 7,) only a he-goat or a ram was to be offered; if the former, the rump, &c. were to be given (v. 3); if the latter, the fat of the intestines and the reins were to be offered, and the blood poured out at the foot of the altar.—*Victim.*Sept. “ram.”—*Holy.*To be eaten by priests, and in the court of the tabernacle, v. 6. C.—Sins of commission,*peccata*, and of omission,*delicta*, are equally offensive to God. S. Aug. q. 20. W.  
**8** *Skin.*Of these skins a great profit was made. Philo de præm. sacerd.  
**9** *Priest’s;*to be divided among his brethren, v. 10. They officiated a week by turns. C.—Each, therefore, claimed the parts allotted by God to the priest on duty. But it is not certain what part they could retain for their own use. Some think that the unbaked flour alone was to be distributed equally, v. 10. Bonfrere.  
**11** *This.*Here the Roman, Sept., Junius, &c. commence the 7th chapter.  
**12** *Oil.*Any of these sorts of bread would suffice. Jacob and Jethro had formerly offered sacrifices of praise, and the Greeks had some which they termedSoteria.C.  
**13** *Bread*, for the use of the priests. C. 2:11.  
**14** *Of which*leavened bread,*one*, representing all the rest,*shall be offered for first-fruits.*Heb. “a heave-offering,” not as a sacrifice. M.—Others maintain that a loaf, without leaven, was laid upon the altar; and all the rest given to the priest. C.  
**15** *Morning.*Thus were they admonished to let the poor share of the bounty which God had bestowed upon them. Theod. and Philo.  
**16** *It.*The victim of thanksgiving was more worthy, as it proceeded from a more disinterested motive. M.—Such victims as were perfectly voluntary might be received, though they had some defect C. 22:23.  
**17** *Fire.*No part must be reserved so long, as to become offensive and putrid. C.  
**18** *Yea rather.*Heb. “it is an abomination to be thrown away,” and the soul, &c. Thus by neglecting to comply exactly with God’s commands, we lose the fruits of our former piety. H.—The flesh of these victims might be eaten in any clean place, by all those who were not defiled. C. 10:14. Joseph. T.  
**19** *Shall eat of it.*That is, of the flesh of the thanks-offering. Ch.—People might eat the flesh of animals which had been touched by something unclean. Deut. 12:15. 22. But victims, defiled by any accident, were to be burnt. The others were to be eaten only by such as were clean. M.  
**20** *People*excommunicated, or even slain, either by God, or by the judge. C.  
**21** *Uncleanness of man*, means a person defiled, or his excrements. A Lapide.  
**23** *Eat*, when they have been once immolated. See C. 3:17.  
**24** *Uses.*Heb. “for any other use: but you shall not eat it.” Origen (hom. 5,) seems to reject this fat entirely.  
**26** *Beasts.*Hence the Rabbins except the blood of fishes, as it is not specified. C.  
**29** *Sacrifice*… Libations, flour, wine, and oil. Lyran.  
**30** *Hands*, upon a silver dish. The priest shall direct his hands to form a triple cross. Cajet. T.  
**31** *The breast*, and other parts mentioned, Deut. 18:3.  
**34** *Separated*from the breast for the Lord, and*waved*before Him, as the Heb. intimates.  
**35** *Anoin**ting.*Le Clerc translates*the food.*On this Aaron shall be maintained. This shall be his salary or portion, in quality of God’s anointed.  
**36** *Israel.*Heb. adds, “in the day of his anointing,” or consecration. C.  
**37** *Law.*Six sorts of sacrifices are here specified, holocausts, flour-offerings, sin and trespass-offerings, those for the consecration of priests, and the peace-offerings.  
**38** *In*, or at the foot of Mount Sinai. H.

## Chapter 8

**2** *Bread.*This basket stood near the altar of holocausts, in the court. Most part of this chapter has been already explained. Exod. 29.  
**7** *Garment, subucula*, which is styled a strait tunic. Ex. 28. This was girded close, while the upper garment (*máil*) was fastened by the ephod, contrary to what Josephus and others have asserted. C.—*Truth.*When the ephod and rational were joined together, God gave his oracles, 1 K. 23:9. No woman could wear the ornaments, which were made by divine wisdom. S. Cyril in Lev. xiii. 6. W.  
**9** *Sanctification.*Having these words engraven on it,*Holiness to the Lord.*  
**12** *Head.*To shew that he was the fountain of the priesthood, and that power was derived from him.  
**13** *Linen.*Aquila translates “inward.” It was next to the skin.—*Mi**tres*, caps. Ex. 28:4. These were the garments of priests. Those of the Levites are not particularized. About six years before the destruction of the temple by Titus, the Levites obtained of Agrippa leave to wear the linen tunic, which was deemed a great innovation, seldom left unpunished. Joseph. Ant. xx. 8.  
**14** *Calf.*This ceremony was repeated for seven days, v. 33. C.—At the same time, Moses consecrated the altars and all the furniture of the tabernacle, v. 10.  
**23** *Foot.*The whole person was thus sensibly consecrated to God’s service. H.—The pagan high priest, among the Romans, was adorned in silk and ribbands, with a crown of gold. Being conducted under ground, the blood of an ox, which had been sacrificed, came upon his head, ears, and other parts of his body, through little holes, made in a board; and thus besmeared, he was recognized by the people. Prudent. hym. S. Romani, Saumaise. &c.  
**27** *Who having.*Moses supported and directed the hands of the priest.  
**30** *Vestments.*It is a maxim among the Rabbins, that a priest without his vestments, is not considered as such; and he is put to death, if he should dare to approach the altar in that condition. When the priests lay aside their sacred robes, they are looked upon as laymen. C.—The high priest was consecrated by the unction on the head; (v. 12,) those of an inferior condition, were sprinkled with ointment mixed with blood, &c. M.  
**33** *Finished.*During this time, some say they were allowed to go our for a short time, to satisfy the calls of nature; while others say they were to continue always in the tabernacle, or in the court. Afterwards the priests on duty continued all the time in the temple, adorned with their sacred robes. The high priest could not wear his on other occasions, except some very urgent affair require it, as was the case when Jaddus went to meet Alexander. C.  
**34** *Done … so.*The Heb. adds, “the Lord hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you.” H.  
**35** *Watc**hes.*They might be permitted to take a little sleep during part of this week. T.—*In:*Heb. “at the door of the tabernacle of the assembly, attentive to the ordinances of the Lord.” H.—*Die*, as Nadab did afterwards. Moses officiated as the consecrating priest. One of the most venerable of the order, consecrated the successors of Aaron. Some assert, that they only invested him with the pontifical robes. Num. 20:25. 1 Mac. 10:21. C.—The power of Moses was extraordinary; that of Aaron was ordinary, designed to continue in after ages. S. Aug. q. 23. None must presume to take this office of priest, but such as are called by God. Heb. 5. Those of the old law, were initiated by sacred rites or sacraments, which signified the grace of God, requisite to perform their duties well. They were chosen from among men, to be more holy; of which their washing was a sign, as their splendid robes were to remind them of their sublime dignity and authority over the people. The high priest had seven special ornaments: 1. white linen, to denote purity; 2. a curious girdle, intimating that he must use discretion in all things; 3. the long tunic of various colours, with bells, &c. signifying heavenly conversation upon earth, union and harmony in faith and morals; 4. an ephod, with two precious stones on the shoulders, teaching him to support the failings of the multitude; 5. the rational, with its ornaments, shew that the pontiff should be solicitous to teach sound and profitable doctrine; 6. the mitre indicates, that all his actions should be referred to God above; and lastly, the plate of gold denotes that he should have God always in view, and never forget that consummate holiness which He requireth. See S. Jerom ep. ad Fabiol.—The three ornaments of the priests, put them in mind of purity, discretion, and a right intention, to be observed in all their conduct. On this occasion, a change was introduced in the priesthood, as the law was new; the first-born being obliged to give place to Aaron’s family. Thus, when these were deprived of the exclusive privilege, and people from any family were chosen by Christ, the law of Moses ceased to exist. Heb. 7. The ordination of the former was a figure of that sacrament, by which Christian priests still receive grace and power. 2 Tim. 1. Theod. q. 48. Num. S. Aug. de bono conj. 24. W.

## Chapter 9

**1** *Come.*From the consecration of the tabernacle, ( M.) and of Aaron.—*Israel.*The princes of the tribes. C.—They were to offer sacrifice by the hands of their new priests.  
**2** *Calf**.*As they had formerly adored a calf, so now they sacrifice one to God. S. Jer. in Jer. vii.  
**3** *Children.*Sam. and Sept. “the ancients,” or princes of the people, for whom a*he-goat*is sacrificed.—*Old.*Not above, though they might be younger.  
**4** *Offering*, &c. Heb. simply, “and a flour-offering tempered with oil; for,” &c. H.—All these sacrifices were accompanied with an offering of this nature, as they were in imitation of a dinner presented to God. M.—*You.*By the cloud, resting upon the tabernacle, or by fire proceeding thence. God will manifest his presence by miracles, v. 24.  
**7** *Thy sin.*Christ*needed not daily (as the other priests) to offer sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s.*Heb. 7:27.  
**9** *The altar*of holocausts; as he is yet considered only as a private person; afterwards he touches the altar of perfumes. C.  
**10** *Burnt*, or placed in order to be burnt by the fire sent by God, v. 24. M.  
**11** *Camp.*According to the prescriptions given. C. 4:12.  
**14** *Water.*Heb. adds, “he burnt them upon the holocaust, upon the altar.”  
**15** *And expiating the altar.*Heb. “he offered it (the goat) for sin, as the first,” for himself, placing the parts of the victim upon his own holocaust. H.—The Chaldee says, “he expiated the altar with the blood of the he-goat, as he did before.”  
**17** *Holocaust.*Which were religiously observed every day. The law respecting the libations was given already, though it be related, Num. 15:4. M.  
**21** *Elevating them.*After which they were used by the priest, C. 7:31. C.—*As.*Samar. and some Heb. MSS. read, “as the Lord had commanded Moses.” Kennic.  
**22** *Hands.*Thus representing the form of a cross, on which Christ redeemed us; in memory of which we still make the same sign. W.—*Them.*The blessing is recorded, Num. 6:24.*And the Lord bless thee*, &c. M.—In blessing an individual, the priest laid his hands upon him; but he stretched them out towards the multitude, as a mark of superiority.  
**23** *Testimony.*To offer incense, which always preceded the morning holocaust.—*Glory;*or fire, probably issuing from the tabernacle, and consuming the victims in a moment. Thus God was pleased to shew his approbation of the priests and victims, ( C.) and at the same time, to impress a religious awe upon the minds of the spectators. H.—This fire was carefully preserved and nourished by the priests with wood; though the Rabbins say, this was done only to conceal the miracle of its perpetual continuance. A fire of the same nature, came down upon the victims, when Solomon dedicated his temple, (2 Par. 7:1,) and was kept burning till the captivity, when it was hidden in a cistern. Being found afterwards, like a muddy water, God rekindled it again, (2 Macc. 1:18. 2:10,) and it was not lost till the persecution of Epiphanes.  
**24** *The Lord:*2 Mac. 2:10, explains this text.*Fire came down from heaven*, appearing like a flash of lightning, in the midst of the victims. Jos. Ant. iii. 9. C.

## Chapter 10

**1** *The eldest sons*, as they are mentioned first. Ex. 6:23.—*Censers.*On the same evening of their consecration.—*Fire.*Not taken from the altar of holocausts. C. 6:9. Whether they neglected to do so out of respect for the miraculous fire, or out of thoughtlessness and inattention, their fault was severely punished, however venial in itself; ( T.) that all might learn to comply exactly with God’s commands, and not dare to explain them away. Thus we must carefully avoid the mixing of falsehood with the word of God. Theod. q. 9. W.—Those in power, like priests, if they be negligent, shall suffer great torments. Wisd. 6:7. They must expect to be treated with rigour. S. Aug. q. 21. Estius infers, from the command to abstain from wine being given, (v. 8,) that these priests had been rather intoxicated. Josephus says, they had not offered proper victims; and the Rabbins assert, that they were not clothed with the sacred garments: but the Scripture only condemns them for taking strange fire. Some imagine, that no formal precept had yet been given. But had not God commanded (C. 6:9. 12,) that the victims should be burnt with the*perpetual fire on the altar*, and were not these young priest guilty of rashness in doing any thing of their own head, without positive instructions? Hence some infer that their offence was mortal, and that their punishment a prelude of eternal torments; while others piously hope that their sin was only venial, and that it was expiated by their repentance and violent death, in which sense Philo explains*they died before the Lord.*Hence they were buried honourably.  
**2** *Lord.*Near the altar of incense, being stricken, as it were with lightning, so that their garments were not injured. C.  
**3** *Spoken*, by this exemplary judgment. H.—We do not find the exact words recorded before: but there are some equivalent, shewing that God requires a particular sanctity in his ministers. C. 8:35. Ex. 19:22.*The altar shall be sanctified by my glo**ry;*(Ex. 29:43,) may be considered as a prediction of what happened on this melancholy occasion.—*Peace.*Excessive grief requires silence;*curæ graviores silent*. “He was filled with grief.” Sept. adoring the judgments of God. The fortitude of Mino and Xenophon, who, upon hearing of the death of their sons, did not desist from sacrificing, is greatly admired. C.  
**4** *Brethren;*cousins. These were ordered to bury the priests, as Aaron and his family were employed about the altar, ( H.) and could not perform the office without contracting a legal uncleanness. Josephus. T.  
**6** *Uncover not.*Take not off your mitres; (Sept.) let not your hair grow long, (Chal) as the Egyptians do in mourning, nor, yet shave your heads, like the priests of Isis. This God forbids. C. 21:5. And Ezechiel, (44:20,) probably with reference to this law, says,*Neither shall they shave their heads, nor wear long hair … and no priest shall drink wine when*, &c.—*Garments*, sacred vestments, which were worn only in the tabernacle or temple. C.—The high priests are forbidden to tear their garments at funerals, (C. 21:10,) as this would betray a want of fortitude.—*Perhaps.*This does not imply any doubt. M. See Gen. 3:3.—*Indignation*of God, punishing the people, while there is none to entreat for them.—*Burning*of the two priests.  
**7** *On you.*So that you cannot now join in the funeral, as there are so few anointed. H.—On other occasions, priests are allowed to mourn. C. 21.  
**9** *Drunk.*Hebrewshekar;which the Sept. and Vulg. commonly translate by*sicera*, any strong liquor, (S. Jerom) particularly palm-wine. S. Chrys. in Isai. v. 11.) Jonathan says old wine. Hecateus assures us, that the Jews drink no wine at all in the temple. But the Rabbins admit of some exceptions. This abstinence was prescribed by any other nations to their priests and magistrates in office. C.—The intent of the law, is to prevent any mistake arising from the fumes of wine, (v. 10,) as likewise all drowsiness or foolish mirth. As mourning and excessive grief are prohibited on the one hand; so are intoxicating liquors, on the other. H.  
**12** *Sacrifice*, of flour or bread. A tent was undoubtedly erected, where the priests might take the necessary refreshments of meat and sleep, during the days of their service.  
**14** *Place*, at home. The Sept. translate, “in the holy place;” understanding that these sacrifices for sin were to be eaten in the court of the tabernacle. Malvenda allows, that the children of the priests, and their wives, might come thither to eat the parts of the peace-offerings allotted to them. But of this there is no proof.  
**15** *Sons.*Sam. and Sept. add, “and thy daughters.” The male children were allowed to partake of the sin-offerings: those of*peace*, were given also to females.  
**16** *While*, &c. Heb. “and Moses sought diligently for,” &c. This goat had been offered the same day, for the sins of the priest and of the people. C. 9:15. Aaron had not taken the parts allotted to his family, being too much grieved, and perhaps thinking that they could not eat all. C.—Therefore, he judged it conformable to God’s command to consume the whole. C. 7:17. Moses fearing lest the thing had been done through negligence, finds fault with this two*sons;*but on hearing the remonstrance of Aaron, is satisfied. H.  
**17** *People.*Offering the sacrifices of expiation, as mediators between them and God.  
**18** *Places.*This is not a victim, the blood of which is to be poured out in the holy place, and the flesh consumed with fire. C.—*You ought*, or might lawfully*have eaten it.*C. 6:25.  
**19** *How*, &c. My children are slain. Heb. “and if I had eaten the sin-offering to-day, would it have been agreeable to the Lord?” H.

## Chapter 11

**1** *Aaron.*God shews him this honour after his consecration, though not always. See C. 12 and 17. &c. W.  
**2** *Animals which you are to eat*, &c. The prohibition of so many kinds of beasts, birds, and fishes, in the law, was ordered, 1. to exercise the people in obedience and temperance; 2. to restrain them from the vices of which these animals were symbols; 3. because the things here forbidden were for the most part unwholesome, and not proper to be eaten; 4. that the people of God, by being obliged to abstain from things*corporally unclean*, might be trained up to seek a*spi**ritual cleanness.*Ch.—These animals had no natural uncleanness: for all*things are clean to the clean.*Tit. 1:15. But they were looked upon as such by the prejudice of the people, and many of them possessed noxious qualities. If they had been the most excellent, the will of God is a sufficient reason to enforce the duty of abstinence; ( C.) as it was in the case of Adam and Eve. As some animals were adored, and others were deemed unclean by the Gentiles, the Hebrews were commanded to sacrifice some of the former description, and to abhor also the latter, that they might never be so foolish, as to imitate the perversity of the nations, in looking upon any animal as a god. Theod. q. 11. S. Thomas (i. 2. q. 102. a. 6,) explains at large, out of the holy fathers, the different vices, which the unclean animals represent. W.—By the distinction of these creatures, God would have his people known., C. 20:24. 26. Those who chose to die rather than transgress in this point, are justly honoured by the Church as martyrs, 2 Macc. 6 and 7. S. Greg. or. 20. H.  
**3** *Hoof divided, and cheweth the cud.*The dividing the hoof, and chewing the cud, signify discretion between good and evil, and meditating on the law of God: and where either of these is wanting, a man is unclean. In like manner, fishes were reputed unclean that had not fins and scales: that is, souls that did not raise themselves up by prayer, and cover themselves with the scales of virtues, ( Ch.) particularly of mortification and penance. W.  
**4** *Camel*, which hath a hard skin connecting its hoof below. The Arabs and Persians eat its flesh. God will have his people keep at a distance from imitating them; and that is one of the reasons for this and similar precepts. C.  
**5** *The cherogrillus.*Some suppose it to be the*r**abbit*, others the hedge-hog: S. Jerom intimates that it is another kind of animal common in Palestine, which lives in the holes of rocks, or in the earth. We choose here, as also in the names of several other creatures that follow, (which are little known in this part of the world) to keep the Greek or Latin names. Ch. Bochart (Hierozoicon) may be consulted on this subject. He supposes, that the Hebrewshaphan, denotes the Arabian rat called aliarbuho. But the Jews themselves are ignorant of many of these animals. C.—Bothchoirosandgrullos, signify swine. The porcupine, or the bear-mouse of Palestine, may be meant. M.  
**6** *Cheweth.*Some copies of the Sept. add*not*, which agrees with the nature of the hare; though the people to whom Moses addresses himself were of a different persuasion. Its hoof is not divided into two parts only, and therefore it is accounted unclean.  
**7** *Swine.*This animal was abhorred by many other nations. If an Egyptian happened to touch one, he plunged into the Nile. Herod. ii. 47. Few are to be seen in the East. Yet the people of Crete and of Samos held swine in veneration; and they were offered in sacrifice to Venus, by the Cyprians. They seem designed for slaughter, as they are good for nothing alive. They are very subject to leprosy. C.—The Jews would hardly name them, but called them “the beast.” Old Eleazer was strongly instigated to pretend at least to eat swine’s flesh, but preferred a painful death before the transgression of God’s law, 2 Mac. 6:18. H.  
**8** *Carcasses.*They might be touched while alive, v. 24.  
**9** *Eat.*The Egyptians, and the priests of the Syrian goddess, abstained from fish.—*Pools.*Heb. and Sept.*torrents.*C.—Eels are prohibited, &c. M.  
**10** *Scales.*Numa forbade fish without scales to be used in the sacred feasts. Plin. xxxii. 2.  
**13** *The griffon.*Not the monster which the painters represent, which hath no being upon earth; but a bird of the eagle kind, larger than the common. Ch.—*Osprey.*The sea or black eagle, which is very clear-sighted, and expert at catching fish. Pliny relates, (B. x. 3,) that it tries its young by making them look at the sun, and hurls them down if they refuse. But this seems fabulous.  
**16** *Ostrich;*which was served up at the tables of the Persian kings. Heb. “the daughter of the hiena;” (*both êiáne*) or the swan. Isai. 13:21.—*Owl*, or perhaps the male ostrich, which cruelly abandons its young.—*Larus*, the water-hen. C.—Some have the cuckow. H.  
**17** *Owl*, or the onocrotalus, which makes a hideous noise like*an assibis*, a bird adored in Egypt. Bochart takes the Hebrew to mean an owl, as well as the following term,*swan*, ( C.) which is not probable.  
**18** *Bittern*, onocrotalum. See v. 17. Protestant version has “pelican and the gier-eagle,” for*porphyr**ion**.*H.—Its beak and long legs are*red.*Plin. x. 46. Bochart understands the vulture, and the Samaritan version the pelican; both of which are remarkable for the care they take of their young.*Reme*may be derived from*rem*, “mercy.”  
**19** *Heron*, or “stork,” noted for the same quality:chasida, means “piety.”—*Charadrion*, a kind of heron, ( C.) mentioned by Aristot. 8:3. It is found in deep holes and rocks. M.—Some translate parrot, peacock, kite, &c.Anapha, may denote a bird easily vexed. C.—*Houp*, or lapwing. H.—*Bat.*Strabo (xvii) speaks of some very large, which were salted and eaten at Borsippe.  
**20** *Feet.*Such as bees, ( C.) and other insects of which he speaks. M.  
**21** *Walketh.*Heb. addslo, “not.” But the Massorets readlu, “to it,” agreeably to the Vulg. C.—Prot. version, “Yet these may ye eat, of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon*all four*, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth.”  
**22** *Locust.*The three former are species of the same kind. The*bruchus*is a young locust, without wings, (S. Aug. in Ps. civ.,) and theattachusthe least of all. Plin. xxix. 5. The*ophiomachus*is large, “encounters serpents,” and is destitute of wings. The nations called*Acridophagi*, received their name from their feeding upon locusts, which are the food of the common people in Syria and Africa. See Plin. xi. 29, &c. Clenard, in 1541, wrote from Fez, that he had seen the sky darkened with clouds of locusts, which the people endeavoured presently to destroy, and filled wagons with their bodies, for food. Kirsten says, they are very delicious. Arnulph assures us, that they are a finger’s breadth, and are fried in oil by the poor. Raban. in Matt. iii. 4. See Joel 2. C.—There is no need, therefore, of having recourse to crab fish and wild pears, for the Baptist’s food, as Beza has done. T.  
**24** *Evening.*If he were guilty of sin in so doing, contrition would be necessary to regain God’s favour. W.—But the legal uncleanness would not be removed till the evening; as the one might subsist while the other was remitted. H.  
**25** *Necessary.*To prevent the obstruction of the road, or the infection of the air. M.—When any person touched these carcasses, he was obliged to wash his clothes immediately, and still to refrain from touching any thing sacred*till sun-set.*Estius.—If a dog chanced to die in the house of an Egyptian, all the family shaved their hair and began to mourn. The food and wine in the house could no longer be used. Euseb. præp. ii. 1. They adored the dog. But other nations, which did not adore animals, esteemed those unworthy of sacred things who had touched a carcass, though they invoked their gods by*slaying beasts*, as Porphyrius remarks, ib. v. 10. They put off their*shoes*when they enter certain temples, for the same reason.*Scortea non ulli fas est inferre sacello—ne violent puros exanimata Deos**.*  
**26** *It.*When dead. It was lawful to ride on a camel, but not to eat its flesh.  
**27** *Hands.*Like a monkey, frog, &c. the fore-feet of which rather resemble hands.  
**29** *Weasel.*Bochart understands the mole, in opposition to all the versions:choled, means indeed “to root up the earth.” C.  
**30** *Chameleon*, feeds upon air, and assumes various colours. Plin. viii. 33. It resembles a lizard, as does the*stellio*, ib. xxix. 4.—*Lizard.*Prot. “snail.” H.  
**33** *Broken.*See C. 6:28, where a similar injunction is given. M.—And (v. 35,) ovens and pots, made of earthenware, according to Pollux are to be destroyed. T.  
**34** *Water*, unclean, or in a polluted vessel.  
**36** *Clean.*They would be so difficult to purify, and water is so necessary.  
**38** *Defiled*, and given to the beasts. M.  
**39** *Beast die*a natural death, or be suffocated, or be slain by a wild beast. C.  
**40** *Clot**hes*, and his whole body, either together or separate, as the Rabbins explain the law. Selden syn. i. 3. If any one eat or touch these things, on purpose, he was liable to a more severe punishment, ( M.) and his*soul was defiled*by disobedience, v. 43. C.  
**42** *Abominable.*Serpents, worms, and reptiles are proscribed. M.  
**44** *Holy*, and detest the uncleanness of the Gentiles, in their sacrifices and feasts. S. Aug. de C. D. vi. 7.  
**45** *Your God.*By these laws, the Jews were to be distinguished from other nations. H.—They were also to be reminded, that God was very jealous of their interior sanctity, since he required so great a legal purity. Without the former, they might easily conclude that the latter would not please him. C.

## Chapter 12

**2** *Child.*By this manner of expressing himself, Moses excludes the blessed Virgin, as the ancient fathers and the moderns generally remark. She conceived without concupiscence, and was subject to none of the usual inconveniences of child-birth. Suarez.—So that whether this law was instituted to expiate the former, or to purify the latter, she was not included. All other mothers were separated, at least seven days, and longer if their state required it; ( C.) during which time, they were treated like those mentioned, C. 15:19. After that period they were allowed to manage their affairs, as usual, but not to touch any thing sacred, nor suffer their husbands to approach them, till the expiration of 33 days more, v. 4. M.—Euripides blames Diana for keeping such women at a distance from her altar, while she delighted in human sacrifices. Iphigen. v. 380. Censorinus says, “Prægnan ante diem quadragesimum non prodit in Fanum; & post partum pleræque graviores sunt, nec sanguinem interdum continent.” Grotius.  
**3** *Eighth.*Nothing but the child’s health could retard the day, ( C.) unless the parents were under the necessity of taking a journey, as they were in the desert, &c. H.  
**4** *Sanctuary*, or court of the tabernacle, where the women had probably a place apart. C.  
**5** *Days.*In all 80, double the time required for a male child, as they infirmities of women continue so much longer when they bear a female. Vales. sac. Philos. c. xviii. Hippocrates allows forty-two days for the one, and thirty for the other.—*Purification.*Some copies of the Sept. read,*in he**r pure*, others,*in her impure blood;*which Origen attempts to reconcile by observing, that she is deemed less impure during the last thirty-three or sixty-six days, than in the preceding ones. C.—During these, she was treated almost like those who were under the greatest legal uncleanness, C. 15. Numbers 5. Those who were under the*less*, might enter the court of the Gentiles, and did not infect others by their touch. Josep. c. Apion 2. T.  
**6** *Lamb*, to thank God for her happy delivery.—*Sin*, or uncleanness, which was esteemed a legal offence. Perhaps this sacrifice was also designed to expiate the sins she might have fallen into, ( M.) since she was last able to offer one; and likewise the original sin of her female offspring. That of males was effaced by circumcision. H.  
**7** *Blood*, which has caused her legal uncleanness.  
**8** *Lamb.*This was the case of the blessed Virgin: (Luc. 2:24,); so poor was she! M.—It seems difficult to conceive, how all the women of Palestine could present themselves before the tabernacle, 40 or 80 days after the childbirth. Perhaps the law regarded those only who lived in the neighbourhood. The priests explained to the rest what they had to do, whether they might defer bringing their offering till the next great festival, or they might send it by another hand. We read that Anna came to the temple after she had weaned Samuel, 1 K. 1:21. C.

## Chapter 13

**2** *Colour*, &c. Heb. “a tumour, abscess, or white spot,” which are the three marks of leprosy. C.—*Leprosy.*The leprosy was a figure of sin: and the observances prescribed in this and the following chapter, intimate what ought spiritually to be done, in order to be delivered from so great an evil, or preserved from it. Ch.—The authority of the priests in the new law to bind or loose sins, was hereby prefigured. S. Chrys. de Sacerd. 3. W.  
**3** *Flesh.*These two signs indicated the species of leprosy called volatile, or*impetigo*, ( M.) resembling a scab, which did not penetrate the flesh or bones, as our leprosy or elephantiasis does. Vales. C. 19.—*Separated*from society. Heb. he shall contaminate him. See v. 11. H.—Some assert, that the physician was first to be consulted. But none but the priests could declare them unclean, or set them at liberty. After they had pronounced sentence, the lepers might apply for medicines to others.  
**6** *Obscure.*Some translate the Heb. “retired,” with the Syr. and Arab. versions.—*Scab*, “an ebullition,” or pustule. Theod. S. Jer. in Nah. ii.—*Clothes*, and himself. See C. 11:40.  
**8** *Uncleanness*, or permanent leprosy.  
**10** *Liv**ing flesh.*The leprosy is caused by immense numbers of worms, which crawl between the skin and the flesh, and sometimes infect the latter, and they very bones, garments, &c. Hence the flesh seems all in motion, and living. H.—The different spots in the skin represent heretical opinions obscuring the true faith, of which priests are the judges. Deut. 17. S. Aug. q. Evang. ii. 40. W.  
**11** *Invete**rate.*Celsus says, this sort of leprosy is hardly ever cured.—*Up.*But, as the Rom. Sept. reads, “shall separate him,” from the people.  
**13** *Clean.*The white leprosy causeth no itching. Gorrheus. Cels. v. 28. Theodoret (q. 16,) says, it is incurable; and therefore, the person infected is not shut up, out of pity. So S. Paul (1 Cor. 5:11,) forbids us to eat with a dissolute Christian, while he allows us to have commerce with infidels, though they be wholly corrupt. But others assert, it is not so difficult to cure as that which is partial, v. 14. The hand of Moses was stricken with this white leprosy. Ex. 4:6. C.—This species is not so contagious. M.  
**14** *Live flesh*, raw, the skin being consumed in various parts.  
**16** *Whiteness*, after the red flesh is covered with skin as usual.  
**20** *Ulcer*, as before, v. 3.  
**23** *Place*, which is contrary to the nature of leprosy.  
**24** *Scar.*If it had proceeded from burning it would have been black. M.  
**26** *Obscure.*Heb. may be, “stopped,” as it is opposed to v. 22,*if it spread.*See v. 55–6.  
**27** *Unclean.*Heb. adds, “it is the stroke of leprosy,” and the Sept. “it has spread in the ulcer.”  
**30** *Leprosy*, or scurf. C.—This species causes the hair to be yellow, and not white. M.  
**31** *Black.*The Heb. Sam. &c. prefix “not,” which ought probably to be away, as the natural colour of the hair, in that country, is black; while yellow, or white hair, give reason to suspect leprosy; and (v. 32,) the Heb. says, “if there be no yellow hair in it,” which insinuates that it was black before. The Sept. have explained both verses in the same sense, as they found the negation also. If we admit it, we may distinguish black hair from that which approaches to brown, or light-coloured hair. When therefore a person, who had before black hair, has experienced some*change*, he must be shut up seven days; after which, if his hair be not become yellow or reddish, he must be shaved, &c. C.  
**39** *Blemish*, or scab, of which Celsus speaks, B. 5.  
**42** *Colour*, indicating some bad humours, which had caused the hair to fall off.  
**45** *Loose*, both for the benefit of the leper, and that others may beware of him. M.—*Bare*, letting the hair grow, (C. 21:5. 10,) in testimony of mourning. The leper behaved like one in mourning, tearing his garments, neglecting his hair and beard, or cutting them, and, through shame, covering his face. Ezec. 24:22. The Persians would not allow any lepers to enter their cities. Herod. ii. 138. C.  
**46** *Camp*, or city, unless some great man, like king Ozias, might be permitted to dwell there in a house, secluded from all society. 4 K. 15:5.—2 Par. 26:21.  
**47** *Garment that shall have the leprosy.*These prescriptions, with relation to garments and houses infected with the leprosy, are to teach us to fly all such company and places as are apt to be the occasion of sin.  
**49** *White.*Heb. and Sept. “greenish.”  
**51** *Grown.*Heb. adds here, (and v. 53–6–7–9,) “in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of a skin.”  
**55** *Returned*, which it had before it was infected, and, consequently, as the Heb. reads, “behold the plague has not changed its colour.” H.  
**56** *Dark*, or “at a stand.” See v. 6. Heb.keha, means to sink, like the eyes of an old man, &c.  
**57** *Flying*, as that in man, v. 12. Heb. it is a leprosy, which returns and is rooted. Chal. “it spreads.” C. See Calmet’s Diss. on the Leprosy.—This dreadful disorder is very common in Arabia and Palestine. During the holy wars many of the Europeans were infected with it. The Jews believe, that the leprosy of garments and of houses was restrained to Judea, and attacked them only when the people rebelled against God. Oleaster.—The providence of God often visited those, who would not obey his ministers, with this disorder. Deut. 24:8. Num. 12. Theod. q. 18. T.  
**59** *Pronounced.*This word should refer to both;*mundari vel contaminari**, how it ought**to be pronounced clean or unclean;*as the law regards the declaration of the priests, and not the medicines to be used for the leprosy. H.

## Chapter 14

**3** Camp. The leper was not left to his own judgment to mix with society, as soon as he perceived himself cleansed. He had to send for a priest; and one of the most discerning among those who made it their employment to study in the court of the tabernacle, was commissioned to examine him. Grotius.—The sacrifice was offered without the camp, ( C.) if it may be called a sacrifice. M.—That of Christ’s body was not yet instituted, which supplies all the rest. S. Aug. c. adv. i. 19. W.  
**4** *Sparrows.*Heb.tsipporim.Sept. “little birds,” which the law only determines must be clean; such probably as might be procured most easily. The leper was to present them, and kill one. But the priest sprinkled with its blood the other bird, which was tied with a scarlet ribband to the cedar-wood and hyssop, in such a manner that its head and wings were not much wet, as it as to fly away. C.—The cedar prevents putrefaction, the hyssop is very odoriferous, the scarlet and the bird denote beauty and life, which qualities the leper must acquire. So the penitent regains the virtues he had lost, with interest. T.  
**5** *Living waters.*That is, waters taken from a spring, brook, or river: ( Ch.) not stagnant or rain water.  
**7** *Rightly.*According to law. H.—The number seven is used to denote perfection, v. 15, &c. M.—*Field.*An emblem of the liberty which the leper would soon enjoy. H.—The pagans cast over their head the things which had been used for their purification. Virg. Ec. viii. 102.*Fer cineres, Amarilli, foras, rivoque fluenti—Transque caput jace, ne respexeris**.*—There were afraid to trample upon them. Gell. x. 15. Metam. xiii. 954. There were also accustomed to set birds at liberty in honour of their gods. Demosthenes accuses Conon of having eaten those which had been used in his purification. Bonfrere believes that Moses does not here prescribe any sacrifice. Why then is a priest employed to make these aspersions? C.  
**8** *Body*, even to the*feet.*Isai. 7:20. H.—Probably with a pair of scissors. C.—The Egyptians priests did so every third day, that nothing impure might be concealed. Herod. ii. 37. The greatest caution was requisite to prevent the return of the leprosy; and therefore, after the first purification, (v. 4,) the leper is not allowed to go home, till a sufficient time has elapsed to ascertain whether he be radically healed, and then he must offer a sacrifice, v. 10. H.—But why so many prescriptions for a disease so involuntary, ( C.) which must have caused the unhappy sufferer so much pain? H.—The Rabbins assert, that the leprosy was sent to punish some secret transgression, particularly some pride or detraction; as they maintain, that every illness is in punishment of some offence. Abarbanel. Grotius.—If was often the effect of intemperance or negligence; and the sacrifices were exacted, to make some reparation to God for remaining in the camp and near the tabernacle, at the commencement of the disorder. C.—This foul cutaneous disease was also very infectious, and the law was designed to impress people with a horror of it, and to teach them to prevent its ravages as much as possible. H.—A sparrow is slain, and the hair shaved, to indicate that all sinful affections must be cut off by the true penitent, while the sparrow, which is sent away into the desert, reminds him that he must live a stranger to pleasure, and perfectly mortified. D.—*Days;*without having any communication with his wife. Lyran.  
**10** *A sextary;*Heb.log*:*a measure of liquids, which was the twelfth part of a*hin;*and held about as much as six eggs. Ch.—For each of the victims a sacrifice of flour and oil was required. H.  
**12** *Offered.*Heb. “elevated,*or*waved,” as Ex. 29:24.  
**13** *Place;*on the left hand of the altar of holocausts. C. 1:11. This sacrifice is different from that for sin, v. 19. C.  
**14** *Taking of the blood*, &c. These ceremonies, used in the cleansing of a leper, were mysterious and very significative. The sprinkling seven times with the blood of the little bird, the washing himself and his clothes, the shaving his hair and his beard, signify the means which are to be used in the reconciliation of a sinner, and the steps by which he is to return to God, viz. by the repeated application of the blood of Christ; the washing his conscience with the waters of compunction; and retrenching all vanities and superfluities, by employing all that is over and above what is necessary in alms deeds. The sin-offering, and the holocaust or burnt-offering, which he was to offer at his cleansing, signify the sacrifice of a contrite and humble heart, and that of adoration in spirit and truth, with gratitude and thankfulness, for the forgiveness of sins, with which we are ever to appear before the Almighty. The touching the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the great toe of the right foot, first with the blood of the victim, and then with the remainder of the oil, which had been sprinkled seven times before the Lord, signify the application of the blood of Christ, and the unction of the sevenfold grace of the Holy Ghost to the sinner’s right ear, that he may duly hearken to and obey the law of God; and to his right hand and foot, that the works of his hands, and all the steps or affections of his soul, signified by the feet, may be rightly directed to God. Ch. See C. 8:23.—These ceremonies might serve to call to the leper’s recollection the benefit which he had received, and to distinguish him from others. C.  
**17** *Blood.*Sept. and Syr. “upon the place of the blood,” on the person’s ear, thumb, and toe.  
**21** *Offering.*Heb. “a trespass-offering to be waved,” v. 12. 24.—*Oil.*The same quantity of oil is required as v. 10. The rest is diminished two-thirds; only instead of the ewe and one lamb, two turtles or pigeons are substituted. H.  
**31** *Trespass.*Heb. “sin,” v. 19. The Chal. and Sept. agree with the original text. M.  
**34** *If there.*Heb. “and I send the plague;” whence some infer, that this*leprosy*was an effect of God’s special indignation against the owners of the house. Muis, &c.  
**36** *Become.*If any thing was left in the house, it was deemed unclean, as soon as the priest had declared that the house was infected; and therefore, all was to be removed before he came, ( C.) and might be used without scruple, unless some marks of leprosy appeared afterwards on the*garments.*C. 13:47.  
**37** *Paleness.*Heb. “greenish.” H.—Such spots are often observable in damp churches and cloisters, and cause the plaster to fall off. It is probable that little worms produce this effect. To prevent these vermin from spreading, Moses orders the whole house to be demolished and carried away, if it cannot be otherwise purified. C.—Thus the plague is communicated not only by persons, but also by all the things which they have touched. The same signs of leprosy are found both in men and in houses. M.  
**41** *Scraped.*Heb. “he shall scrape.” But the Sam. copy has, more properly, “they shall scrape.” Houbig.  
**53** *For the house*, that it may be no more infected; and for the people, to whom it belongs, that they may carefully avoid offending God, the avenger of all sin. Heb. “you shall make an atonement for the house,” or for the sins of its inhabitants. H.  
**54** *Stroke.*Heb. “scurf,” ulcers, wounds, &c. C.—“The leprosy of the head or beard.” Chal. Montan. T.  
**57** *Be known when.*Heb. “to teach in what day, &c.… This is the law of leprosy.” H.

## Chapter 15

**2** *Issue of seed, shall be unclean.*These legal uncleannesses were instituted in order to give the people a horror of carnal impurities. Ch.—If the gonorrhœa, and the lawful act of marriage, (v. 16,) and nocturnal delusions, (Deut. 23:10,) induce a kind of uncleanness—surely to imitate Onan is most detestable, Gen. 28:9. T.—The Jews rank the latter crime with murder, and so does Tertullian. See Ex. 21:22.  
**3** *At every moment*, is not in Heb., but something like it occurs in the Sam. and Sept. According to the Heb. the uncleanness subsists for some time after the issue has ceased. Grotius pretends that these disorders were contagious; but the reason why God requires such purity in his people, is given v. 31. He dwelt among them, and would not allow of any disrespectful behaviour. There were to live like priests in his temple. The pagans in Egypt, Greece, and Italy, required the like attention to cleanliness in their priests. Herod. ii.—*Noctem flumine purgas**.*Persius ii. C.  
**11** *Such a one;*the person under the disorder, unless he have washed his hands.  
**12** *Broken*, after he is perfectly healed. C.  
**15** *Offer*, (faciet) “shall sacrifice.” D.—*For sin.*Legal, or any other that he may have incurred.  
**16** *Evening*, whether the action were lawful or not. M.—Some explain this verse, of nocturnal inconveniences; and v. 18, of the act of marriage. The latter rendered unclean only in as much as it hindered a person from partaking of any thing sacred, though he might perform the duties of life. C.—This law was to lay some restraint on the too frequent use of marriage. Theodoret. D.  
**19** *At … month.*The Heb. and other versions omit this. C.—But “*her issue in her flesh*,” implies as much. H.—Naturalists anciently deemed this very contagious. Solin c. i. Plin. ix. 15. C.—*Days*, not out of the camp, but from the company of men.  
**20** *One*, except infants, &c.  
**24** *Days*, supposing the case was not brought before the judge, and the man did it through ignorance: otherwise it was death. C. 20:18.  
**25** *Blood*, hæmorrhoids. M.—*Flowers.*Heb. “all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation. She shall be unclean.”  
**28** *Run.*Then she might act as usual, without defiling what she touched. It seems from v. 13, that this law regarded only the time while the tabernacle was in the camp. It would have been very difficult to observe it, when the people were dispersed throughout the land of Chanaan. C.  
**31** *Teach.*So the Sept. also read. Heb. “Thus you shall remove … from their filth.” Houbig.—*Filt**h.*God threatens to kill them, if they approach unclean. M.—S. Jerom (in Gal. v.) understands this of those abominable sins, which ought not to be mentioned. W.

## Chapter 16

**1** *Fire.*It was upon this occasion that the feast of expiation (kippurim) was instituted, to enforce the reverence due to holy things, and particularly to the tabernacle. Heb. adds, “before the Lord,” ( H.) and does not specify*strange fire;*but the Chaldee and the Syriac do. C.  
**2** *Enter not.*No one but the high priest, and he but once a year, could enter into the sanctuary: to signify that no one could enter into the sanctuary of heaven till Christ our high priest opened it by his passion, Heb. 10:8. Ch.—When the tabernacle was to be removed, and when he had to consult the Lord, he might also enter, arrayed in his pontifical attire. If the high priest was prevented by any legal uncleanness, the next priest was substituted to perform his office. Josep. xvii. 8.*Adjuto**r vicarius propter cognationem ei datus est**.*  
**4** *Washed.*On this day the high priest appeared in linen clothes, like one of the inferior priests, without the jewels; thought Josephus (de Bel. v. 15,) asserts the contrary. C.—This was a feast of sorrow and of penance. T.—Perhaps he put on his more costly attire before he entered the holy of holies, v. 23, 4. H.  
**6** *Calf*, or young bull, which Aaron offered for himself and all the family of Levi, to expiate the sins which they might have committed during the year. If their sins were voluntary, they were obliged also to have perfect charity and contrition. The ram was offered for the sins of the people. Moses speaks of the red heifer, (Num. 19) which was also offered, out of the camp, for the people. This solemn day was to be kept by all as a rigid “fast from meat, drink, washing, anointing, wearing shoes, or using marriage.” This is the idea which the Oriental nations generally have of a fast. They commence at midnight, and end with the following sun-set; after which they eat what they think proper. C.—On the day of expiation, the Jews made a tenfold confession of their sins. Morin. pœnit. ii. 22.  
**8** *The emissary-goat:**ca**per emissarius**;*in Greek,apopompaios;in Hebrew,Hazazel.*The goat to go off*, or as some translate it, the*scape-goat.*This goat, on whose head the high priest was ordered to pour forth prayers, and to make a general confession of the sins of the people, laying them all, as it were, on his head; and after that to send him away into the wilderness, to be devoured by wild beasts, was a figure of our Saviour, charged with all our sins, in his passion.  
**11** *After … celebrated.*These words are not in the Hebrew.  
**12** *Censer*, which resembled one of our chalices; without any chains, &c. Apoc. 5:8. C.  
**13** **Ver.****13****,****14****.***The cloud.—The blood*, &c. This is to teach us, that if we would go into the sanctuary of God, we must take with us the incense of prayer, and the blood, that is, the passion of Christ. Where also note, that the high priest, before he went into the holy of holies, was to wash his whole body; and then to put on white linen garments; to signify the purity and chastity with which we are to approach to God. Ch.—The Sept. call this goatapopompaion, “the averter of evils,*or*the one sent away.”*Hazazel*is taken by Spencer Julian, the apostate, (ap. S. Cyr. 9. and ep. 39,) to mean the devil; as if the goat was sent or sacrificed to him, which is very foolish. C.—*East.*That is, the forepart of the mercy-seat, which was not to be touched with the blood, ( M.) no more than the veil. Rabbins.  
**15** *Oracle.*He probably took this blood at the same time with that of the calf. Heb. 9:7. M.—Though some Rabbins assert, the high priest entered the holy of holies four times on that day. Drusius. Pausanias tells us, that the temples of Dindymenes and Orcus were opened only once a year. C.  
**16** *Filth.*God deigned to have his tabernacle in the midst of the camp, where so many sins, and marks of disrespect, as well as legal uncleannesses, were found. H.—Sin so defileth the soul, that the most holy place is contaminated thereby. Theod. q. 22.  
**17** *Out.*Even the other priests were excluded from the tabernacle. The high priest placed incense on the censer as soon as he entered within the veil, and prayed for all blessings, in few words, that the people might not be uneasy, fearing lest something had befallen him. This was the form: “Be pleased to grant, O Lord our God, that this year may be warm and rainy, that the sovereign power may abide in the house of Juda, that thy people may not be deprived of any of the necessaries of life; and hear not the petitions of travellers,” (which are commonly vain and selfish) of “of sinners,” as others translate. C.—Those who were forbidden to be present this occasion, might have made the same objections as Protestants do against the law of the Church which prescribes a language not commonly understood by all, in the administration of her sacraments. Have either any reason to be offended? H.  
**18** *Let him pray for himself.*Heb. “he shall expiate or purify it,” the altar of incense. Josephus says he also sprinkled with blood the great altar of holocausts, v. 20. Ant. iii. 10.  
**22** *Desert*, to be devoured by wild beasts, ( M.) or hurled down a precipice.  
**24** *Flesh*, which was, in some sort, defiled by touching the goat.—*Garments*, belonging to his office.—*Come out*of the holy of holies. C.—The remainder of the day was spent in joy. The priest washed himself, as a sign that he had obtained pardon. M.  
**26** **Ve****r.****26****.***Camp.*This was always required of those who had burnt the bodies of the victims out of the camp, as v. 28, and Num. 19:7. Outram.—In some of the sacrifices for sin, the priests might eat part of the flesh. But here all was consumed, as the victim was offered for the sins of all.  
**29** *Tenth.*Beginning on the evening of the ninth Tisri, which corresponds with part of our September and October, and is the first month of the civil year. C. 23:32.*Afflict*, by a rigid abstinence from all that might give delight to the body. Children of seven years old begin to join in this mortification. Boys of 13, and girls of 11 years old complete, were obliged to fast. See v. 6. The Samaritans pray all the day, and give no food even to infants during the 24 hours. C.—Moses was the first who shewed them the example; and this was the only day which he prescribed to be kept as a fast. The Jews afterwards appointed many more. H.—Maimonides says, this festival was instituted in memory of the descent of Moses from Mount Sinai the third time, when he came to announce to the people that God had pardoned their idolatry. Usher thinks it was in memory of Adam’s fall. The Jews still observe it in some degree. As they are not allowed to sacrifice, they kill a white cock, and the women a hen, on the 9th at evening. Those with child kill both. They confess their sins, receive 93 lashes, ask pardon of those whom they have offended, and generally spend the fore part of this month in acts of piety and of penance. Buxtorf. Syn. 20.—*Stranger;*a proselyte of justice, such as were bound to observe the law.  
**31** *Of rest.*Heb. “of sabbaths;” that is, a day of most perfect rest; so that even meat is not allowed to be dressed on it, as it is on other festivals. C. 23:27. C.—*Religion.*Fasting is therefore an act of religion. D.

## Chapter 17

**3** *If he kill*, &c. That is, in order to sacrifice. The law of God forbids sacrifices to be offered in any other place but at the tabernacle or temple of the Lord: to signify that no sacrifice would be acceptable to God, out of his true temple, the one, holy, Catholic Apostolic Church. Ch.—On other occasions, many believe that the blood of oxen, sheep, and goats, was to be poured out in honour of God by the priest, who received a part of each. Deut. 18:3. 12:15, 22. Theod. q. 23. Perhaps this law regards the time when the Hebrews sojourned in the desert; and that of Deuteronomy has a reference to those times when they should obtain possession of Chanaan. C.—We read of some private people like Manue and Elias, who offered sacrifice at a distance from the tabernacle. But this was done by a particular inspiration of God, who dispensed with his own law. S. Aug. q. 56. 3 K. 18:23. Judg. 13:19. M. See Jos. 8:31.  
**5** *They.*The Egyptians and other nations,*kill in the fiel**d*, as the Hebrews had also done, till it was now prohibited. Some were, perhaps, still much inclined to adore, ( C.) and to offer sacrifices privately to devils; (v. 7,) and therefore God forbids any sacrifice, but such as was performed by his priests at the tabernacle. H.  
**7** *Devils.*Heb.schirim:which some translate goats, (the hairy ones,) satyrs, &c. The Egyptians adored the goat, (which they represented like the god Pan) particularly in the territory of Mendes, near which the Hebrews had dwelt. Its worship was very abominable and obscene. Strabo xvii. C.—Ezechiel (16:22) intimates that the Hebrews were given to idolatry in Egypt. They had also recently adored the calf. H.  
**10** *Eat blood.*To eat*blood*, was forbidden in the law; partly because God reserved it to himself to be offered in sacrifices on the altar, as to the Lord of life and death; and as a figure of the blood of Christ; and partly to give men a horror of shedding blood. Gen. 9:4, 5, 6. Ch.—Some barbarians feast on human blood. The Massagetes drunk the blood of horses, and the Gelonians of Pontus mixed it with milk. Georg. iii. 463. If the Hebrews did any such thing, and it became public, they were put to death. But if it remained private, God threatens to take vengeance himself of their cruelty and disobedience. The*face*often denotes anger.  
**11** *Life*, (anima). The sensitive soul depends on the blood. The soul and the blood are often used in the same sense. Deut. 12:23. Ps 29:10.*Sanguine quærendi reditus animaque litandum—Argolica**.*Æneid ii. C.—If any one think that blood is the soul of cattle, we need not examine this question very nicely. S. Aug. q. 57. D.  
**13** *Hunting*, with nets, or with bow and arrow. If a dog had killed the prey, it would have rendered it unclean. Tostat. But perhaps dogs were not employed in hunting by the Hebrews. The Persians use lions, &c. Chardin. C.—*Earth*, to prevent any abusive custom, such as that of the magicians, who pretended to raise spirits by blood. Tiresias would not disclose the truth to Ulysses, till he had drunk some blood. Odys. xxii. The Jews abhorred things strangled, and the apostles forbade the primitive Christians to use them. Acts 15. Phocilides, the pagan, says, “abandon such remains to dogs; beasts eat the leavings of beasts.” Euseb. C.  
**15** *Stranger.*Perhaps the proselyte of justice, not simply of the gate, for the latter were allowed to eat and purchase what had died of itself. Deut. 14:21.—*Clean*, having offered the sacrifice. C. 4:27. But if he eat such things knowingly, or neglected these regulations, he was more severely punished. H.

## Chapter 18

**2** *God*, to whom the right of giving laws belongs. D.  
**3** *Ordinances*respecting marriages, divine worship, &c. H.  
**5** *Live in them*, a long and happy life, (Chal.) attended with grace and glory. Lyran.—Jesus Christ and S. Paul explain it of eternal life. Matt. 19:17. Rom. 10:5. C.  
**6** *Approach*to marry, much less to gratify his sensual appetite. H.—*To him.*Heb. “None shall approach to any of their descendants;”*ad omnes reliquias carnis suæ**;*to any of those who spring from the same stock. The Jews assert, that all are bound by the law of nature to abstain from their own mother and sister, from another’s wife, and from unnatural conjunctions. Seld. Jur. v. 11. C.—*Nakedness*, or turpitude, which title the body deserves, when it is used in a manner contrary to the law of God.  
**7** *Father*, with whom the daughters must not have any connexion, as Myrrha had with Cymoras. Metam. x. H.—All relations in a right line are excluded for ever, according to the emperor Justinian. The reason of these various impediments is, 1. That God’s people may not resemble infidels, who permitted such things, v. 3. The Persians married their own mothers, daughters and sisters. S. Clem. strom. 3. Semiramis married her son Justin. Cleopatra was both mother and wife of the two Ptolemies, Philometor and Euergetes, or Physcon. T.—The Egyptians took their sisters to wife for a long time, by the authority of their laws, and in imitation of Isis. Diod. 1. Clem. recogn. 9. Solon permitted people to marry their step-sisters by the same father, and Lycurgus only those by the same mother. Philo ad 6. præc. 2. By this law, the bands of society are strengthened, and families become connected. S. Aug. C. D. xv. 16. 3. Disorders which would easily take place under the same roof, on the prospect of a future marriage, are prevented. 4. The contrary practice would often prove contrary to order and decency, as the son would be raised above his mother. These regulations seem to have been made from the beginning, or at least from the time of the deluge; since the nations not subject to the law of Moses, are condemned for the transgression of them, v. 24. See Gen. 19:33. C.  
**8** *Father.*He hath known her; and to him she belongs, as being one flesh. H.—If he were even dead, it would shew a want of respect to marry his widow, though she were not your own mother. C.—This law, Ruben and the incestuous Corinthian transgressed. T.  
**9** *Abroad;*being born of your mother, while she was married to another. The marriages of brothers and sisters at the beginning, were authorized by necessity; but now they are the more to be condemned, as religion forbids them. S. Aug. de C. xv. 16. Some Rabbins assert, that such connexions were lawful till the time of Moses. But S. Epiphanius (hær. 39,) maintains, they had been condemned long before. Seneca (S. Aug. de C. D. vi. 10,) acknowledges that such marriages of the pagan gods were not right;*ne pie quidem**:*and Plato says, they are*hateful to God.*The Romans punished them with death. Many barbarians do not, however, make any scruple to contract marriage with their children, or with their mothers. S. Jerom c. Jov. ii. 2. Eurip. Hermione. C.  
**11** *Sister*, by thy step-mother.  
**12** *Father.*Nearly related, and springing from the same source. M.  
**14** *Who … affinity.*Heb. “she is thy aunt.” Some say that, in the old law, a person might marry his niece, but not his aunt; as the order of nature would be inverted if the aunt were subject to her nephew. But others assert that the law was reciprocal, and excluded the marriage of both. The emperor Claudius married his niece Agrippina, and authorized others to do the like. But only one imitated him at Rome; (Sueton.) though Tacitus (An. xii.) says, other nations did it with solemnity, as they had no law to the contrary.*Aliis gentibus solemnia*, &c. C.  
**16** *Brother;*though she may be even divorced from him. S. Aug. q. 61. If the brother were dead without offspring, the next relation was bound to marry her; (Deut. 25:5) and the kinsman of Booz was accounted infamous for neglecting this duty. Ruth 4:6.  
**17** *Daughter*, together, or successively; even if she were the child of another husband.—*Incest.*Heb. “a crime.” Aquila, “an abomination.” Sept. “an impiety.”  
**18** *Rival her*, (*in pellicatum*). Heb. Chal. “to trouble her.” After the death of one sister, it seems, another might be taken. Jacob had two at once. Some think that polygamy is here forbidden. But the law seems to have tolerated it; and only condemns*many*, or too great a number, with respect to the king. Deut. 17:17. The impediments specified in this chapter may be comprised in these four verses:  
**19** *Thus*, &c. The refractory were to be slain. C. 20:18. It was thought that the infant would be in danger; and hence the Jews punished with death the man whose child was born lame. S. Augustine (q. 64,) believes that this law is still in force; and some accuse the person who neglects it, as guilty of a venial sin. Bonfrere.  
**20** *Wife.*This crime is to be punished like the rest, v. 29.  
**21** *Consecrated.*Heb. “to pass through*the fire*to Moloch.” Sept. “to serve the ruler.” Syr. “to marry strange women;” as also C. 20:2. One of the sons of Achaz was offered to this idol of the Ammonites; and yet, perhaps, succeeded his father; (4 K. 16:3. 18:1,) which shews that the children were not always burnt to death, but only lustrated, or made to pass over or between two fires. Yet many assert that the children were frequently consumed in the flames, and God condemns the cruel parents to be punished with death. C. 20:2. The brazen idol was heated red hot, and the unhappy victim was placed in its arms, or the priests dragged the child over or between the fires. The surrounding nations delighted in human victims. The Carthaginians offered them till the time of Iphicrates. Adrian abolished several such cruel customs among the Greeks. See Porphyr. de Abst. ii. Jerem. 7:31.—*God;*by causing any to suppose that he is cruel, like the idols. We must mention his name with the utmost respect. “The mouth, which utters the sacred name of God, ought never to pronounce a shameful word.” Philo de 10. præc. Some think, that the idolaters honoured their god by committing an abominable action in his presence. See Malvenda. But most people understand that human sacrifices are here forbidden. C.—The nations of Carolina very lately observed the same custom as the ancient idolaters, in sacrificing their children to the devil, by buring them to death in a brazen statue. Vives in Civ. Dic. vii. 19. Moloch was represented as a king, in all his ornaments, with the head of a calf. He was, perhaps, the idol adored by other nations, under the name of Saturn, who devoured his own children. Bonfrere. T.  
**22** *Abomination*, punished so severely in the Sodomites. Gen. 19. Yet, even the philosophers of Greece were not at all ashamed of it. Bardesanes assures us, that the eastern nations punished it with death, and would not allow the guilty the honours of burial. Those beyond the Euphrates were so shocked at it, that they would kill themselves if they were only accused of such a crime. Ap. Eus. præp. vi. 10.  
**23** *Crime.*Heb. “confusion.” The Egyptians did so with goats, as part of their religion. See C. 20:16 and An. Univ. Hist. We need not, however, infer from this law, that the crime was common among the Jews, as Voltaire would insinuate. H.—Nothing but monsters can proceed from such wickedness. M.  
**28** *Vomited.*Moses speaks of what would shortly happen, as if it had already come to pass, which is familiar with the prophets. C.—He represents the earth as sick and disgusted with the crimes of its inhabitants, in the same manner as the Book of Wisdom (v. 23,) says,*the water**of the sea shall rage*(or foam,*excandescet*)*against them.*The strong expression used by Moses, shews to what a length the Chanaanites had carried their abominations; so that God, justly irritated, orders them all to be exterminated.  
**29** *People.*Heb.hammam*.*The same temporal punishment is inflicted upon all the aforesaid crimes, though they were not all equally grievous. The smallest of them deserved to be treated with such severity, to prevent the spreading of such contagious vices. H.—The regulations respecting marriage, were not immutable, or all determined by the law of nature, which admits of no dispensation. Only those relations in a right line, and the first in the collateral line, can be esteemed of this description. D.—If Protestants maintain, that all these regulations of Moses are part of the natural law, and bind Christians, they must also allow that a person must marry the widow of his deceased brother, if he has left no children. Deut. 25. God would never have established this general rule for his people, if it were in opposition to the*natural law;*which is clear and obvious to all people by the light of reason, according to Aristotle. Polit. 2. Neither would so many holy men have violated this law without reproof, if it had prohibited the marriages of two sisters, of aunts, &c. See Gen. 29. Exod. 6:20. God never dispensed in the right line; (1 Cor. 5:1) and such relations, or even people in the first collateral degree of consanguinity, marrying, are punished with death. C. 20. Whereas those in the second degree, or in the first of affinity, undergo a smaller punishment; which shews that the transgression, in both cases, is not against the law of nature. No man ever undertook to dispense with the marriage of brothers and sisters; though Beza lays this to the charge of Pope Martin V. But the person alluded to, only obtained leave to retain the sister of her whom he had privately dishonoured, when his marriage could not be dissolved without great scandal. S. Antonin. 3. p. tit. i. 11. As, therefore, some of these impediments were introduced by the positive ceremonial law of the Jews, which was abrogated by Jesus Christ, they have no other force at present than what they derive from the authority of Christian republics, which have adopted some and changed others, appointing, in some countries, death for the punishment of theft, and not of adultery, though the old law enjoined the reverse. See C. 20:10, and Gen. 38:24. Ex. 22:1. The Church may, therefore, surely dispense with those laws which she has enacted. W. Trid. Ses. xxiv. 3.—She has indeed restricted marriage between relations to the fourth degree included, both of consanguinity and of affinity. See the C. of Lateran, under Inn. III. But she will not allow people to marry their aunts, brothers’ widows, or sisters of their deceased wife, as the Jews do. T.

## Chapter 19

**3** Sabbaths. Both those which occur every week, and extraordinary ones, v. 30.  
**4** *Idols.*Heb. “vain things.” C.—*Molten*, or any other sort of workmanship. M.  
**7** *Profane.*Heb. “it shall be defiled.” Sept. “improper for sacrifice.” Aquila, “It shall be rejected.” C.—So that the person who had offered it, shall become more guilty. M.  
**9** *Ground.*Heb. and Sept. “the extremity of thy field.” The Rabbins say, a sixtieth part of all the products of the earth, was to be left for the poor. Seld. Jur. vi. 6. Thus God teaches his people to exercise themselves in the acts of mercy. D.  
**10** *Strangers*. Sept. and Syr. “proselytes,” who might dwell in the country. As the soil did not belong to them, great compassion was requisite: otherwise they must have perished, or become slaves.—*Lord;*the sole proprietor. C.  
**11** *Lie.*“When no injury is done to another, it is a great question whether a lie can ever be justified. The case would perhaps be easily decided, if we considered the commandments alone, and not the examples,” of those holy men who seem to have sometimes thought it lawful. S. Aug. q. 68. But is it not better to allow that these were under an inculpable mistake, than to defend one fault, because it is not attended with the guilt of another, by hurting others? Even lies of jest and of excuse, are contrary to the gravity and open-dealing of a Christian; and God never speaks of lying without marks of disapprobation. H.—Heb. “you shall not deny,*or*refuse” to restore, what has been entrusted to you; (Grotius) “nor deal falsely,*or*extenuate yourselves,” pretending that you cannot give alms. Oleaster.  
**12** *Profane.*No greater indignity can be offered to God, than to solicit Him, as it were, to assist us in doing evil, by attesting falsehood. Philo.  
**13** *Morning.*Pay what is due to the labourer, immediately, if he desire it. H.—It was customary among the Jews to pay their workmen in the evening. Matt. 20:8.  
**14** *Deaf.*The wordKophos, used by the Sept. means also the dumb, as these defects are generally found in the same person. Nothing can be more base, than to attack those who are unable to defend themselves. Solon forbids anyone “to speak ill of the dead,” though he may receive an injury from his children. Those who undermine and ruin the reputation of the absent, are no less to be condemned.  
**16** *Detracter, whisp**erer.*Heb.rakil, stands for both these terms. Some translate a parasite, a merchant, vilifying the goods of others to enhance the price of his own; or a spy, seeking to discover and laugh at others’ faults.—*Neighbour;*accusing him wrongfully, to the danger of his life; or lying in wait for him like an assassin. But strive rather to rescue those who are attacked. Those who neglect this duty, are responsible for the consequences, according to the Jews, (Seld. Jur. iv. 3,) and the laws of the Egyptians. Diodor. 1.  
**17** *Openly*, is not in the Heb. or other versions. Instead of bearing malice at the heart, we are authorized to demand our right in a legal manner, or to correct in a fraternal matter, the person who may have injured us, lest we*incur sin*for our neglect, and the offender continue impenitent. Jesus Christ instructs us to do this with as little disturbance as possible. Matt. 18:15. Yet public sins must undergo a public correction. 1 Tim. 5:20. S. Aug. ser. 82. Love should regulate our complaints. Id. q. 70.  
**18** *Revenge*, by private authority, or out of passion, which the pagans themselves acknowledged was more becoming a brute than a man,*feræ est**.*Muson. Sen. de ira ii. 32.—*Citizens.*Heb. “observe*or*lie not in wait.” Sept. “act not with fury against the son of thy people.” C.—Heb.notor, means to upbraid when doing a kindness.—*Thy friend.*Heb.rehaka, may denote thy neighbour, or any one with whom we have any thing to do. Thus God orders us to love strangers as ourselves, (v. 34,) and to help our enemy. Ex. 23:4. The false insinuations of the Jews are fully exploded by Jesus Christ. Matt. 22:39. We must love the offender, but detest the offence. S. Aug. c. Faust. xix. 24. If God required his people to exterminate the Chanaanites, he did not authorized them to entertain any personal animosity against their persons, but they were to act as ministers of his justice. “O Lord, (said Philo very justly) we do not rejoice at the misfortune of our enemy, (Flaccus) having learnt from thy holy laws to compassionate the distress of others. But we thank thee for … delivering us from our afflictions.” C.  
**19** Kind. Mules were therefore either brought from other countries, (3 K. 10:28,) or they were produced by some of the same species, as, good authors assert, is frequently the case in Syria, Cappadocia, &c. Plin. viii. 44. Pineda. T.—Spencer (Leg. ii. 20,) says, without any proof, that this law had a reference to the impure conjunctions of animals, in honour of Venus and of Priapus.—*Different seeds*, &c. This law tends to recommend simplicity and plain-dealing in all things; and to teach the people not to join any false worship or heresy with the worship of the true God. Ch.—*Draw not the yoke with infidels.*2 Cor. 6. Theod. q. 27. These different colours were not in themselves evil, since they were used in the priests’ vestments. They insinuate, that we must avoid schisms. W.—The sowing of different seeds tends to impoverish the soil. Plin. xviii. 10. The Egyptians sowed various seeds on a board, covered with fine mould; and, observing which sort was destroyed by the heat of the sun in the dog-days, superstitiously refrained, that year, from sowing any of it, lest it should produce no crop. Palladius.—*Sorts.*The Rabbins say of linen and wool, as Deut. 22:11. They allow other sorts. Josephus (iv. 8,) supposes, that garments of the former description were thus reserved for the priests alone. The*Flamen*, among the Romans, could not wear a woollen garment sewed with thread, without committing a sin;*piaculum erat*, says Servius. These precepts were to be literally observed, though they concealed a moral instruction of the greatest consequence, importing that all unnatural intercourse was to be avoided. Pythagoras conveyed his instructions under similar enigmatical expressions, saying, “we must not stir up the fire with a sword,” as Solomon does likewise. Prov. 30:15. Eccles. 12:3. 6. C.  
**20** *Marriageable.*Heb. “promised,*or*given in marriage.” Sept. “reserved for another … she shall,” &c. Onkelos and the Arabic version suppose also, that the woman alone was to be scourged with leather thongs; a punishment to which the Samaritan copy condemns only the man. The Rabbins agree with the Sept. Others translate, “there shall be an enquiry made,*or*they shall be set free, and shall not die.”  
**22** *Pray.*Heb. and Sept. “shall atone for him with the ram of the sin-offering, before the Lord, for his sin.”  
**23** *The first-fruits. Præputia*, literally their fore-skins: it alludes to circumcision, and signifies that for the first three years the trees were to be as uncircumcised, and their fruit unclean; till the fourth year their increase was sanctified and given to the Lord, that is, to the priests. Ch.—In some countries, people take off the buds to strengthen the tree. C.—The fruit, during the three first years, is not esteemed so good or wholesome; and therefore, it could not with propriety be presented to God. Philo de Creatione.—*Unclean.*Heb. “three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you; it shall not be eaten.” H.  
**24** *Lord.*It was to be brought to the holy city, and offered with the other tithes, out of which a feast was made for the poor, &c. Joseph. iv. 8. Besides the first-fruits for the priests, and the tithes for the Levites, out of which they again paid tithes to the priests, there was an annual tithe prescribed, (Deut. 12:12,) to supply a feast for the indigent, &c. at Jerusalem, along with this fruit; and another, every third year, designed for the poor alone (Deut. 14:28,) at the place of each one’s abode. T.  
**26** *Blood.*The flesh of any animal. The blood must belong to God. The members of the Sanhedrim eat nothing on the day that a criminal is executed, supposing that this is the meaning of the precept. The Sept. readerim, “on the mountains;” and another version has, “on the roof,” as if the worship of idols on high places were forbidden. H.—*Divine.*Perhaps by means of “serpents,” or “plates of brass,” as the Heb.ness, may insinuate. These methods were known to the ancients. Horace, Ode iii. 37. Plin. xxx. 2. C.—*Dreams.*Heb. times. See Gal. 4:10. H.  
**27** *Cut your hair*, &c. This, and other such like things, of themselves indifferent, were forbidden by God, that they might not imitate the Egyptians or other infidels, who practised these things out of superstition, in honour of their false deities. Ch.—The pagans consecrated locks of hair, and their beard, when it was first cut, to Apollo, the river gods, the hours, Esculapius, &c. Some, at Rome, hung the hair on a tree. T.—The Arabians and Macæ left only a tuft of hair at the top of their head, in imitation of Bacchus. Herod. iii. 8. iv. 175. This tuft is called*sisoe*by the Sept. who seem to have alluded to the Heb. term*tsitsith.*See Ezec. 8:3. The ancient scholiast says, this was left in honour of Saturn. It resembles a crown. The same custom was observed by the Syrians, (Lucian) Idumeans, &c. Jer. 9:25.—*Beard.*Heb. “the angle,*or*extremity of your beard.” These regulations would seem beneath the attention of a lawgiver. But they were made in opposition to some profane customs of the surrounding nations. The Jews still observe this direction, and leave the beard from the ear to the chin, (where they let it grow pretty long) and also two mustaches, or whiskers, on the top lip. The Egyptian mummies have only the beard on the chin. The eyebrows and other hair of the gods and inhabitants of Egypt, were entirely cut off. In mourning the chin was also shaved. God forbids his people to imitate them. C.—But heretics need not hence infer, that the tonsure of priests and monks is reprehensible. Randulph.—Superstition and affected delicacy in curling, &c. are to be avoided. T.  
**28** **V****er.****28****.***Dead.*Adonis or Osiris; as if you were mourning for them, in which sense the former verse may be explained. At funerals it was customary to cut off the hair. Achilles and his soldiers did so at the death of Patroclus. Homer.—The Persians also cut the manes of their horses, to shew their grief for the loss of Masistius, (Herod. ix. 24,) as Alexander did when Hephæstion died. Plutarch.—The Egyptians, Assyrians, &c. cut their hair on the like occasions, and the Hebrews did so too; whether they neglected this law, or it was rather designed only to hinder them from joining in a superstitious lamentation for some idol. They also cut their bodies, Gen. 50. Jer. 41:5. The pagans did so, intending thereby to appease the anger of the infernal deities:*ut sanguine … inferis satisfaciant*, (Varro, Servius): or to please the deceased. Plutarch, de consol. Thus Virgil represents Anna, Æn. iv.:*Unguibus ora soror fædans & pectora pugnis**.*The Roman and Athenian laws restrained this cruelty of women towards themselves. But in Persia, the children and servants of great men still make an incision upon their arms, when their father or master dies. The women in Greece also observe a solemn mourning, with loud lamentations, tearing their cheeks and hair, and reciting the memorable actions of the deceased. The Christians and Jews of Syria inflict still more serious wounds upon themselves. The latter have always esteemed it lawful to adopt the customs of the nations with whom they lived, provided they were not attended with superstition; which makes us conclude, that what Moses here forbids was done in honour of some idol.—*Marks*, made with a hot iron, representing false gods, as if to declare that they would serve them forever. Philo.—The Assyrians had generally such characters upon their bodies. Philopator ordered the converts from the Jewish religion to be marked with ivy, in honour of Bacchus. 3 Macc. Theodoret (q. 18) mentions, that the pagans were accustomed to cut their cheeks, and to prick themselves with needles, infusing some black matter, out of respect for the dead, and for demons. Allusion is made to these customs, Apoc. 13:16, and Isai. 49:15. Christians have sometimes marked their arms with the cross, or name of Jesus. Procop. in Isai. xliv. 5. C.—As S. Jane Frances de Chantal did her breast. Brev. Aug. 21.*Nomen pectori insculpsit**.*S. Paul says,*I bear the mar**ks of the Lord Jesus in my body.*Gal. 6:17. The Church historians relate, that S. Francis and S. Catharine received miraculously the prints of his wounds. H.  
**29** *Strumpet*, which was done formerly in the honour of idols. “They gave to Venus the prostitution of their daughters.” S. Aug. de C. xviii. 5. “In Cyprus they lead the unmarried women to the sea-shore, in order to acquire a dowry by these means on certain stated days, as a libation to Venus.” Justin.—Such things were common in the East. See Lucian de dea Syr. Strabo xvi.—Joel (3:3,) reproaches the Jews with prostituting their sons and daughters for bread; for there were also*effeminate*men among them. 3 K. 14:24. 4 K. 23:7. See Bar. ult. 42. Ose. 4:14. C.  
**31** *Wizards.*Heb.oboth, denotes familiar spirits, (1 K. 8:7,) which gave answers from the belly or breast, as from*a bottle;*whence such wizards are called by the Greeks,engastrimuthoi;and by Sophocles,*sternomanteis**.*C.—*Soothsayers*, are properly those who will judge what will happen by inspecting victims. M.—Heb.yiddehonim, means connoisseurs, intelligent people,*gnostics*, or those who pretend that they can penetrate the secrets naturally impenetrable to the mind of man. Sept.epaoidoi, “enchanters,” who undertake to keep off all misfortunes. “Surely, (says Pliny, xxx. 1,) to learn this art, (of magic) Pythagoras … and Plato undertook long voyages by sea, or rather went into banishment. This they extolled at their return; this they kept as a secret.*Hanc in arcanis habuere.”*  
**32** *Aged man.*Such are supposed to be possessed of wisdom and experience. The Egyptians and Lacedemonians rose up out of respect to an old man. Herod. ii. 80. The Rabbins pretend that a person ought to rise up when the old man is four cubits distant, provided he be, as he ought, a man of wisdom; for otherwise he is entitled to no honour. But this would be making inferior judges of their merit. The Chaldee, Philo, &c. comprise those “learned in the law,” under the name of old men.  
**35** *Rule;*Heb. “taking dimensions” with a yard, tape, &c.  
**36** *Weights.*Heb. “stones of justice,” for stone weights were formerly used. Prov. 16:11.—*Bushel*, &c. Heb. “a just epha, and a just hin.” C.

**2** *Moloch.*See C. 18:21.  
**3** *I will*thus execute vengeance upon him by the hands of his people; and, in case they neglect it, or the crime be secret, I will surely punish the guilty person, and all who may have consented to his wickedness, v. 5. H.—*Face:*Chal. “wrath,” which manifests itself on the countenance. D.  
**4** *My commandment:*Heb. “If the people hide their face not to see:” ( C.) or Sept. “look over on purpose, and neglect the man who has given of his seed to the ruler.”  
**6** *Them.*To have recourse to them, is to deal with the devil and commit idolatry. See C. 19:31.  
**8** *Sanctify you*, and order you to keep at a distance from the impure worship of other nations. H.  
**9** *Die.*The Rabbins say, by being strangled, when nothing farther is added: but if the following addition be made, stoning is understood. But their authority is not of much weight, and is contradicted, v. 2. Stoning was the most usual method of putting to death in the days of Moses, and is commonly meant; or perhaps the judges might determine the mode of execution.—*Upon him.*He deserves to die. He can blame no other. See Matt. 17:25. C.—For greater infamy, the person to be stoned or hung, was stripped of his clothes. T.—The punishment of lapidation (v. 2) seems to be designed for the following times, as it was for adultery. Deut. 22:24. M. John. 8:5.  
**10** *Adulteress.*Philo (de Joseph.) says, whoever discovered a man in the very act, might kill him; and the Roman law allowed the same liberty,*impune necato**.*But God requires a juridical process, and witnesses, as we see in the case of Susanna, (Dan. 13) and in that of the woman who was brought to our Saviour. One witness might authorize a person to put his wife away, and if he then retained her, he was esteemed*a**fool.*Prov. 18:23. But more witnesses were requisite before she could be put to death. They put their hands on the heads of the guilty, thus taking their blood upon themselves, if they accused them wrongfully. Solon allowed the husband to kill the adulterer. The woman was not permitted to wear any ornaments, or to enter any temple afterwards. If she did, any one might tear her clothes, and beat, but not kill her.  
**11** *Father.*See C. 18:8. It is supposed that the father was dead, otherwise the punishment would probably be greater than for adultery. The Sam. “with the wife of his father’s brother.” C.  
**12** *Crime.*Heb.tebel, “confusion,” the same term which is used in speaking of bestiality, (C. 18:23,) though the latter crime be more enormous. H.  
**14** *Alive*, is not in the original; but must be understood. The Rabbins say melted lead was to be poured down the throats of the guilty. The words of Moses seem rather to refer to external fire. C.—*With them*, if they both gave their consent to the crime. M.  
**15** *The beast also ye shall kill.*The killing of the beast was for the greater horror of the crime, and to prevent the remembrance of such abomination. Ch.—The beast was to be killed with clubs; the man was stoned to death. Jonathan.  
**16** *Them.*This monstrous abomination,*teras*, as Herodotus, an eye-witness calls it, was not unknown to the Egyptians.*Gunaiki trag**os emisgeto**;*(B. ii. 46,) nor to other nations. Apul. Met. 10.  
**17** *A crime.*Heb.chesed, commonly signifies an act of piety or goodness, as if Moses intended to insinuate that such marriages were at first lawful. Thalmud. Seld. Jur. v. 8.) But a softer term is used to denote a great impiety, as the Hebrews say to*bless*, when they mean to*curse*, or to blaspheme; ( C.) and the Greeks call the furies Eumenides, or “the good-natured.”—*One another’s.*Heb. “He hath uncovered his sister’s,” &c. Whether they saw what was indecent or not, if they admitted of any unlawful commerce, they were to be stoned to death. H.  
**18** *People*, if the action become public; otherwise the man may be purified. C. 15:24. This intemperance was by a positive law declared a mortal offence in the Jews, though in itself it might be venial. Sanchez ix. 21. The text shews that the woman here gives her consent.—*And she open.*Hence she deserves to die, for exposing herself and her children to great danger. H.  
**19** *Flesh*, or relation. M.  
**20** *Children.*The Sadducees read, “they shall die naked.” The present Heb. has simply, “they shall be without children;” their offspring shall be illegitimate. S. Aug. q. 76. God will not bless their marriage. “Such we know can have no children.” S. Greg. q. 6. S. Aug. Apost. Anglorum. The guilty shall be slain without delay. Grot. C.  
**24** *Honey*. Most fertile and delicious. M.  
**26** *Mine.*This is the reason of these different prescriptions, that they may know the dignity to which they have been raised, and may avoid the manners of the profane. C.  
**27** *Spirit.*Heb.ob, means also*a bottle.*See C. 19:31. If those who consult such people be guilty, the authors of the delusion deserve death still more. H.—The spirit of python is no other than the spirit of the devil, or of Apollo, who was called Pythius, on account of his having slain the serpent python. His oracles were in great request, as he was supposed to know the secrets of futurity. C.

## Chapter 21

**1** *An uncleanness;*viz. such as was contracted in laying out the dead body, or touching it; or in going into the house, or assisting at the funeral, &c. Ch.—*At the death.*Heb. “for a soul;” by which name the carcass is here denoted, because it had once been ruled by the soul. S. Aug. q. 81. This law related only to the family of Aaron, when no absolute necessity or near relation required their attendance. When such offices of charity should be deemed defiling, it is not easy to say. But the ancients generally looked upon them in this light. C. 10:6. Porphyrius enquired of Anebo, why the*holy inspector*touched not the dead, since in all sacred transactions, the death of animals generally intervenes. We know not the answer of this pretended prophet Egypt; and Jamblicus confesses, that the cannot resolve the difficulty. The Romans placed a branch of cypress before the door where a corpse was lying, lest any priest might see it unthinkingly, and be defiled. Servius. “At their return from a funeral they sprinkled themselves with water, and passed over fire.” Festus. The Rabbins say, that no one could be buried in Jerusalem, nor in the towns of the Levites, on account of the sanctity of those places, and for fear lest the priests might thus contract some uncleanness. C.—To account for all these regulations, we only need to observe that such was the will of God; and here it may surely be said,*stat pro ratione voluntas**.*He might thus intend to exercise their obedience; to keep their minds from being too much depressed by the sight of the dead, and to remind us all that we ought carefully to avoid sin, which kills the soul, and renders us really unclean before God. H.  
**3** *Sister*, of the same parents. Vatable.—*Husband;*for if she have, he ought to bury his wife, and to mourn for her. To be deprived of these advantages, was then esteemed a great misfortune.  
**4** *Prince.*Heb. “Let not the prince (of the priests, Acts 23:5,) render himself unclean,” by attending the funerals of any of the people;*or*“let not the husband,” &c. He may be allowed to attend his wife to the grave: or, as others more probably assert, even this is not permitted. She is not one of the persons privileged, v. 2, and Ezechiel 44:25. Ezechiel (24:16,) receives a command not to bewail the death of his wife. The Romans thought their priests would be defiled, by attending the funerals even of their own wives; and Sylla, going to dedicate a temple to Hercules, sent Metella a bill of divorce, and ordered her to be removed from his house, when she was just expiring. Plutarch.  
**5** *Flesh.*This would indicate an important grief, and want of patience. H.—They were not allowed to put on the usual signs of mourning, as the common people were, provided they did it not in honour of an idol. C. 19:27.  
**7** *Vile*, (v. 14,)*defiled*, (*sordidam*). Heb.chalala, “a profane woman,” (Pagnin) or one of ill-fame; as captives, inn-keepers, are generally esteemed.*Zone*, means a common prostitute. Joseph. iii. 3. None of these fit matches for the priests.  
**8** *And offer.*Heb. addresses this to Moses. “Thou shalt sanctify him, therefore, because he offereth the bread of thy God.”  
**9** *Fire.*Provided she be betrothed, and still in her father’s house; so that the infamy fall upon him. Jonathan.—For if she be with her husband, she must undergo the usual punishment of stoning. Other young women received no corporal punishment for simple fornication: the man was bound to marry them, if the father consented; and, at any rate, he was forced to give them a dowry. Ex. 22:16. C.—But if the woman pretended falsely that they were virgins, they were stoned. Deut. 22:20.  
**10** *Head.*Sept. “by taking off his cidaris, or tiara.” He shall not shave his head. C. 10:6.—*Garments*, at funerals, nor the sacred vestments at all. C.  
**12** *Places.*This is to be understood in the same sense. He must not leave his sacred functions to attend any corpse whatever. Having the honour of representing God, and being his first minister on earth, the utmost purity is required of him. Inferior priests may mourn on some occasions; and the Levites are not distinguished, in this respect, from the people; to shew that God requires a sanctity in his officers, proportionate to their exaltation.—*Oil.*Heb. “He is the Nozor;*or*the crown of the anointing oil of,” &c. Joseph has the title of Nazir, (Gen. 49:26,) which is borne by the prime ministers of the Eastern kings. Such is the high priest in the temple. Let Christian priests hence learn what sanctity will be required of them. But why is the pontiff forbidden to bury*his father*, since he obtains that dignity after his decease. S. Augustine (q. 83,) answers, that he was to be consecrated immediately after, that he might offer incense. Another might, however, perform that office. On some occasions, the high priest was deposed, or the dignity transferred to another family. Infirmities might also hinder him from performing the duty. C.—Priests must be detached, as much as possible, from all things which might divert them from their sacred offices. The greatest holiness is required of those who receive the body of Jesus Christ. D.  
**13** *Wife.*Josephus says he could not divorce her. The Rabbins allow him only one wife at a time. It is said that Joiada had two. But that might be successively; and it is not certain that he was the high priest; (2 Par. 24:3. C.) though he has that title in the Vulg. C. 22:11, ibid. H.—His wife must be an Isrealite. The Sept. intimates, “of his own race.” But this is denied by others. He could not marry his brother’s widow, (Selden) nor a girl under twelve and a half. “The Egyptian priests marry only one, while others have as many wives as they please.” Diod. i. C.  
**14** *Widow.*Other priests might marry the widows of their fellow priests. Ezec. 44:22.  
**15** *Nation.*The wife of the high priest must be of noble birth, that he may speak to kings and princes with more authority. M.—Heb. “he shall not defile his race,” &c. by marrying one of another nation, or contrary to law. If he do, the children shall have no share in the priesthood.  
**17** *A blemish.*These corporal defects or deformities, which disqualified the priests from officiating in the old law, were figures of the vices which priests are to beware of in the new law. S. Gregory,*Cura pastorum**.*Ch.—The Rabbins reckon 140 blemishes on which the Sanhedrim had to pass sentence. They also require in the high priest superior beauty, strength, riches, and wisdom.  
**18** *Nose.*Heb. “a flat nose, or any thing superfluous.” Sept. “the nose, (hand) or ears slit.” This verse rejects those whose members are too large, as the next does those who have them too small.  
**20** *Eyed.*Heb.dak, may denote “a dwarf.” Syriac, or something very thin. Ex. 16:14.—*Pearl*, (*albuginem*) whiteness.—*Rupture*, (*herniosus*). One perhaps troubled with the stone, ( M.) whose testicles have been bruised, (Onkelos) or who has only one. Sept. and Syriac.  
**23** *Veil*, which separates the sanctuary from the court. The Athenians chose the most handsome man ot be the king of ceremonies; and the people of Eli appointed such only to carry the sacred vessels, &c. Atheneus xiii. 2. C.

## Chapter 22

**2** *Offer.*He does not speak of such things as fell to the share of the priests; ( M.) but orders them to behave with great reverence when they perform their sacred offices, lest others should take occasion to treat the name of God and holy things with disrespect. Heb. and Sept. “let them not profane my holy name, which they are bound to sanctify;*or*in what they consecrate to me.” Such things must not be used for ordinary purposes. S. Bas. ser. de bapt. ii. 2. and 3.  
**3** *Approacheth*, &c. This is to give us to understand, with what purity of soul we are to approach to the blessed sacrament, of which these meats that had been offered in sacrifice were a figure. Ch.—Such as were unclean either fasted till the evening, or ate unconsecrated meats till they were purified.—*Pe**rish.*The Rabbins say, by the hands of the other priests. The judges could only condemn him to be whipped. If his crime were secret, the punishment was left to God. Seld. syn. ii. 1.  
**4** *And he*, &c. Hence it is plain, even the Jewish priests were bound to observe continence during the time of their ministry. C.—For the same reason, the priests of the new law, who may be called at any time to perform their more sacred functions, engage voluntarily in the state of perpetual celibacy. H.  
**5** *Or any.*Heb. “or a man who may contaminate,” as lepers, &c. M.  
**8** *That.*See C. 17:15.  
**9** *In the sanctuary*, is not found in Heb. which is difficult to explain. “They shall observe my precepts, (*or*“watches,” entering upon the ministry at 17. Josep. M.) and not bear sin for it, and die in it, because they have profaned it;” which*it*, may be understood either of the consecrated food, (v. 7,) or of the sanctuary. C.  
**10** *Sojourner.*“Guest,” or friend. Syriac. None but priests could taste this meat, except they were going to remain in the family for ever. Hence servants and slaves of the Jewish nation, who would one day regain their liberty, are excluded.  
**13** *Children.*If she had any, she remained with them. Philo. Monar. 2.  
**14** *He.*A layman, who, through mistake, eat of any of the tithes, &c. was obliged to give the capital, and a fifth part besides, with a sacrifice, mentioned C. 5:15.—*Sanctuary.*Heb. and Sept. “He shall give to the priest the holy thing.” But if he ate it on purpose, he was to be slain. Num. 15:30.  
**15** *They;*the common people*shall not pr**ofane*, by touching them afterwards, or by retaining any part. C.—The priests shall answer for the profanation, if it be committed through their neglect. H.  
**18** *Strangers:*proselytes of justice, or converts of the Jewish religion. See v. 25.  
**19** *Without blemish.*To teach us to aim at perfection in all our offerings and performances.  
**22** *Scar.*Sept. “If its tongue be cut out,*or*slit.” which was a blemish among the heathens. Servius in Æn. vi.;*lectas de more bidentes**.*They also required the victims to be perfect. The Egyptians had officers called*Sealers*, who were directed by many books how to choose the proper victims. The Hebrew priests had to examine such as were offered to them, with the utmost nicety. See the Misna of Babylon. The idea of God’s perfection, has taught all nations to present to Him nothing but what is perfect, particularly when they offer victims.  
**23** *Ear … cut.*Heb.saruang, which is translated a*crooked nose.*C. 21:18. The Sept. and Syriac agree here with the Vulg.: but the moderns generally adopt the interpretation of the Rabbins, who say the word is applied to those animals whose double members, feet, ears, &c. are disproportionately long; askolut, means too short. Bochart. C.—*Voluntarily*, for the use of the priests, but not for any sacrifice, v. 21. D.  
**24** *Bruised.*Heb. does not specify what part, no more than the Syr. or Arab. versions; but the Sept., Chal., Rabbins, and most commentators agree with us.—*Do any*, &c. (*faciatis**.*) You shall not sacrifice (Syriac) any thing that is rendered unfit to propagate its kind: neither shall you reduce either man or beast to that condition. Josephus c. Apion ii. Rabbins.  
**25** *Bread*, which always accompanies the sacrifices for sin. Holocausts might be offered by the Gentiles, 2 Mac. 3:3. 1 Esd. 6:9. Josep. Ant. xviii. 7. Seld. Jur. 4. 7.—*Them.*To reconcile this with v. 18, we must understand*because*in the sense of*in as much as; they are all corrupted*, when contrary to these regulations. The strangers shall not be allowed to offer any blemished victim. Heb. “Neither from the hand of a stranger shall you offer the bread (or victims) of your God of any of these; because … blemishes are in them: they shall not be accepted (by God) for you (or them).” The Chal. and other versions explain it in the same sense. Presents of gold, &c. were accepted, and kept in the temple. The family of Augustus shewed their generosity in this respect. Philo Legat. C.—Strangers, or pagans, could not offer victims, but they might give money to purchase them. T.  
**27** *Lord.*In this and the following verses, we are taught a lesson of humanity. Tert.—The Romans did not offer sheep or goats till they were eight days old: though the Jews were at liberty to sacrifice them after that term, they generally waited till they were thirty days old. C.

## Chapter 23

**2** *Holy.*The Heb. Chal. and Sept. add, “and meet together;*or*, these are my feasts of assembly.” On these days the people were called together to hear the word of God, &c. M.  
**3** *Sabbath.*Heb. “the rest of rest;” a day in which no unnecessary servile work must be done, no more than on the great holidays, v. 6. 8. H.—*Called*holy, because it shall be really so: in which sense the word is often used. Isai. 9:6. &c.—*Day;*you must not even dress meat, which was also forbidden on the day of expiation.—*Lord*, on which he ceased from work, and which you must keep in his honour.—*Ha**bitations.*In the temple, the priests were intent upon sacrificing, which was indeed a material, but not a formal, violation of the sabbath. Matt. 12:5.  
**6** *Bread.*The obligation of eating none but this sort of bread began at the second evening of the 14th, which was the beginning of the 15th of Nisan. Ex. 12:6. 12. M.  
**8** *In fire.*Sept. “holocausts,” extraordinary ones, besides the daily burnt-offerings. Num. 28:19.—*More holy*than the five intermediate days, on which servile work was allowed. In this and the former verse,*more*and*most*are not specified in the Heb. and Sept. C.  
**10** **Ver.****1****0****.***Land*of Chanaan, at which time these feasts began to be observed. M. See Lev. 2:14.—Before the harvest commenced, first-fruits were offered to the Lord. A gomer containing about three pints of barley was given to the priests, by the nation at large, as each individual was not bound to make a particular solemn offering. The judges deputed three men to gather this barley on the evening of the 15th Nisan, where the neighbourhood assembled near Jerusalem. It was gathered by them in three different fields, after having been thrice assured that the sun was set, and that they had leave to reap, in answer to their triple demands on each head. Then they placed the ears in three boxes, which they brought to the court of the sanctuary, and having ground the barley, and poured a log of oil and an handful of incense upon it, presented it to the priest, who heaving it in the form of a cross, threw as much as he could hold in his hand upon the altar, and kept the rest for himself. Joseph. iii. 10. &c. Private people offered also in kind or in money their first-fruits, or between the 40th and the 60th part of what their land produced. This custom is almost as ancient as the world, (Gen. 4:3,) and we may say that it forms a part of natural religion, which all nations have observed. Porphyrius esteems it an impiety to neglect it. He says that the Thoes, living on the borders of Thrace, were in a moment destroyed, because they offered neither sacrifices nor first-fruits. De Abstin. ii. 7. The ancient Romans and Greeks were very punctual in this respect. Plin. xviii. 20. Those officers who collected this first-fruits among the latter were styled*Parasites.*Many of the festivals among the heathens, occurred at the end of harvest. Aristot. ad Nicom. viii. The Jews might reap their wheat, but they could not taste it, before they had offered the first-fruits, at Pentecost. C. 23:17. Ex. 23:16.—*Of ears.*Hebrewhomor, or gomer, “a sheaf,” denotes also a measure, which was called an assaron, containing almost three pints.  
**11** *Sabbath.*Onkelos has “the good day,” from which the fifty days of Pentecost were counted. C.  
**14** *Corn*(*polentam*). Some translate bruised corn, or a sort of cake. See C. 2:4.—*Dwellings*, even out of the holy land, which was peculiar to this law. Grotius.  
**15** *Sabbath.*Not the ninth day of the week, but the first day of the Passover; from the morrow of which seven weeks or 49 days were reckoned; and the next day was Pentecost. M.—They began, therefore, to count on the 16th of Nisan, and end on the 6th of the third month Sivan. All the intermediate days took their denomination from this second day of the Passover; so that the next Saturday was called*the first sabbath after the second day;*in GreekDeuteroproton, the second-first; (Lu. 6:1,) a term which had puzzled all the interpreters until Jos. Scaliger made this discovery. Emend. 6. The Samaritans count from the day after that sabbath which follows the Passover; so that if the festival fall on Monday, they celebrate Pentecost later than the Jews. See their Letter to Huntington. C.  
**16** *Sacrifice.*Heb.mincha, which relates to the offerings of corn and liquors. Two loaves of wheaten flour leavened, were presented probably by the nation. This festival was instituted in memory of the law being given from Mount Sinai, which was a figure of the law of grace promulgated by the Holy Ghost and by the apostles, on the day of Pentecost. C.  
**17** *Loaves.*The Protestants supply wave loaves, ( H.) though their Heb. text has nothing. The Sam. is more correct. Houbigant.  
**18** *L**ambs.*More were prescribed. Num. 28:27. Josephus joins all together. (B. iii. 10.)  
**20** *Use.*None of the peace-offerings were burnt upon the altar, as the bread was leavened. C.  
**21** *Most holy**.*Heb. “a holy convocation.” H.—It is generally supposed that it had an octave, though the Scripture says nothing of it.  
**24** *Memorial*, or a memorable sabbath. This third great festival sanctified the commencement of the civil year in Tisri, the sabbatical month, according to the ecclesiastical calculation. T. See Num. 29:3.—The sound of trumpets, which ushered in the year with great solemnity, reminded the Jews of the approaching fast, v. 27, (Maimon.) and of those terrible sounds which had been heard at Sinai. Theodoret, q. 32. The Rabbins say that a ram’s horn was used, because Abraham had sacrificed a ram instead of his son. Gen. 22:11. Zac. 9:14. The Jews on this day sound the horn 30 times, feast, and wish one another a happy year. Boxtorf. syn. xix. We know not on what account this festival was instituted. But it was probably ordained in order that the people might learn to thank God for the favours received during the past year, and might beg his blessing on that, upon which they were now entering. C.  
**28** *Servile*is not in the original, or in the other versions, nor in the Vulg. v. 30; whence it is inferred, that this day of atonement was to be kept like the sabbath: so that even meat could not be made ready on it lawfully. C. 16:29. C.  
**29** *Every.*It was difficult for any grown-up person to be entirely guiltless, amid such a variety of precepts, ( M.) which S. Peter says neither they nor their fathers could*bear*, Acts 15:19: and S. James (3) observes,*in many things we all offend.*If any proved so happy as to keep without blame, (Lu. 1:6. H.) they were bound, at least, to grieve for the injury done to God by their fellow members. See Dan. 9:5. M.  
**32** *Sabbaths.*The Church adopts this custom in her divine office. The Jewish day began and ended with sun-set. Ex. 12:6. C.—No part of the ninth of Tisri belonged to this feast, (v. 27,) which only began at the expiration of it. H.  
**34** *Seven days*, during which the people were bound to rejoice, but not to abstain from servile work; except on the first and eighth day. T.—*Tabernacles:*Gr.*Scenopegia**;*because, during the octave, the Jews lived in*tents*, or booths, made of branches, &c. v. 42.  
**36** *Most holy.*Heb. “an holy assembly.”*The great day of the festivity*, Jo. 7:37.—*Congregation.*Heb.hatsereth, “retention.” All were bound to wait till this day was over. In other festivals, it was sufficient if they were present one day. This was the concluding day of the feast of tabernacles. Sept.exodion.Plutarch (Sym. iv. 5.) observes, that this festival greatly resembles that of Bacchus. Ovid (Fast. iii.) speaking of the feast of Anna Perenna, describes it thus:  
**39** *Eighth.*On the feast of the Passover, the 7th day after the 15th was kept holy, because the 14th, or the*Phase*, made also a part of the solemnity, v. 5. 8. H.  
**40** *Fairest tree*, branches of the orange or citron tree, laden with blossoms and fruit. T.—Josephus (iii. 10) says, they took branches of myrtle, willows, and palm trees, on which they fixed oranges. This is the fruit which the Hebrews generally understand to be hereby designated. In the same sense the Arab. and Syriac translate “golden apples.”—*Thick trees*, of any species; though Josephus, &c. restrain it to the myrtle, which was certainly used on this occasion. 2 Esd. 8:12.—*Willows.*Sept. adds also, “branches of agnus from the torrent.” Perhaps Moses only meant that these branches should be used in forming the tents; but the Jews hold them in their hands, while they go in solemn procession round the pulpit in their synagogues, during every day of the octave, before breakfast, crying outAna hosiah na, &c. “Save us, we beseech thee, O Lord; we beseech thee, grant us good success.” They gave the title of hosannah to those branches; in allusion to which, the children sung in honour of Jesus Christ,*Hosanna to the Son of David.*—*Rejoice;*dancing and singing before the altar of holocausts, 2 K. 6:14. The wisdom of God shines forth, in thus attaching to his worship a carnal people, by intermingling with the most solemn ceremonies some relaxation and pleasure. By calling them together so often in the year, they became also better acquainted with one another, and more in love with their religion and country. The ancient lawgivers entertained the like sentiments. Seneca, Strabo x. But the pagans generally carried these diversions to excess. C.—In this chapter we find six festivals specified: 1. sabbath; 2. Passover; 3. Pentecost; 4. trumpets; 5. expiation; 6. tabernacles, lasting till the octave day of assembly and collection. These three last were celebrated in the 7th month, the 1st of the civil year. There was also a feast on all the new moons. Num. 28:11. H.  
**42** *Days.*Tostatus affirms they might pass the nights in their houses; but most people suppose, the Jews spent the whole octave*in bowers.*  
**44** *Feasts.*In the institution of these feasts, as in the other regulations of Moses, there was something ceremonial, which might be altered, and something moral, which regards even those times when the Jewish religion was to cease. S. Aug. q. 43.—Hence we must conclude, that the obligation of keeping certain days holy must always remain. But those appointed for the Jews, as they foretold the future Messias, must be changed, lest otherwise we might seem to confess that he is still to come. Rom. 14. Gal. 4. Colos. 2. We are not therefore allowed to*Judaize abstaining from work*on the Jewish sabbath, ( C. of Laodicea,) as Antichrist will require. S. Greg. ep. xi. 3.—But we must keep Sunday instead, (as even Protestants maintain, though there be no Scripture for it,) by authority of tradition, in memory of Christ’s resurrection, &c. S. Jerom, ep. ad Hed. ib. S. Aug. de C. xxii. 30. So also we observe the Christian festivals, in honour of our Lord and his saints, instead of those which God appointed for the Jews, either by himself or by his ministers: for we find that some were instituted after the time of Moses, (Est. 9 and 1 Macc. 4) and these were sanctioned by the observance of Christ himself,*It was the feast**of the dedication, and Jesus walked in the temple*, &c. Jo. 10:22–3. W.

## Chapter 24

**2** *Command.*It is probable that this order was given while Beseleel was working at the tabernacle. C.—The people were to furnish the necessary sacrifices, &c. by the half sicle, Ex. 30:3, and by voluntary contributions on the three great festivals, on which no one was to appear empty-handed, Ex. 23:15. Some chose to put their contributions towards the temple in the*treasury*, Lu. 21:1.—*Oil:*Heb. “pure oil of the olive beaten, for light to,” &c.  
**5** *Bake.*The family of Caath had to perform this office, 1 Par 9:32. 23:29. M.—*Incense.*Sept. add, “salt.” Villalpend also places*wine*on the table. B. iv. 57.—*Memorial*for the Lord to bless his people, and for them to make their oblations to him as to the living God, from whom all blessings are derived. H.—The incense was burnt instead of the bread, when fresh loaves were placed there. C.  
**8** *Of the*, &c. The Israelites gave a sufficient maintenance to the ministers of religion, out of which these provided the loaves; as S. Jerom testifies, Mal. 1.  
**10** *Egyptian.*Many of these came out along with the Hebrews. Exod. 12:38.  
**11** *The Name.*Some Latin copies add, “of God;” but the best omit it, with the Heb. &c. This is, however, the meaning. C.—The son of Salumith being in a rage, cursed that sacred name; (v. 15) and, as he perhaps had attempted to vent his fury upon whatever came in his way, God here reiterates the laws against murder, &c. v. 17. The Jews are so much afraid of taking the name of God (Yehovah) in vain, that they have for a long time abstained from pronouncing it at all; ( H.) and here they have probably omitted it on purpose. Houbigant. But this seems to border upon superstition, is contrary to the design of God, who revealed that august name, and inserted it very frequently in the holy Bible, and in the very prayer, which the senators have to recite; (Deut. 21:8,) and, can any one suppose, that he would not have them pronounce it, even in their solemn devotions? Many of the Rabbins suppose, that blasphemy is not to be punished with death, if any other name of God be used: but others are more reasonable. Our Saviour was not accused by the Jews of transgressing, in this respect, when they condemned him as guilty of blasphemy. Matt. 26:64. The*name of God*, is often used in the same sense as we use the words majesty, lordship, &c. as being more emphatical, and dignified. C.  
**14** *Head.*To testify, that if they witness falsehood, they are willing to suffer the like punishment; and to beg that God would accept this victim, and not afflict all his people. T.  
**15** *His**God.*Heb.Elohaiv.Philo explains this of idols, as if it were unlawful to speak ill of them, lest we should proceed to do so with respect to the true God. But the prophets, and the most holy personages, had no scruple in speaking contemptuously of the pagan divinities.—*His sin*, and the punishment of it. C.  
**19** *Blemish.*Heb.mum, denotes any thing by which the body is disfigured or hurt. M.  
**20** *Breach*, or fracture: if he break a bone, the like detriment shall he receive.  
**21** *Striketh*, so as to kill or render useless,*percusserit*, ( H.) v. 18.—*Punished.*Sept. “slain.” They omit the first part of this verse.  
**22** *Stranger.*The Jews improperly restrain this law to those nations only which have embraced their religion. God requires that the judges shall not shew more favour to their countrymen, than to others who may dwell among them. C.

## Chapter 25

**2** *The rest*(*sabbathises sabbatum*). The land was to enjoy the benefit of rest every seventh year, to remind God’s people that he had created the world, and that he still retained dominion over it, (S. Aug. q. 91. 92,) requiring the spontaneous fruits of that year as a tribute, part of which he gave to the poor. In the mean time, all creatures rested from their labours, and the people were taught to have an entire confidence in Providence. C.—This law was given in the desert of*Sinai*, in the month of Nisan, the second year after the exit: but it did not begin to be in force till the Hebrews*entered into the land*of Chanaan. H.  
**5** *Reap*entirely, but only take a part, v. 6.—*First-fruits.*None shall be this year presented to the Lord. Heb. has the wordNezireka, “Nazareat,” alluding to the custom of those who, out of devotion, let their hair grow; as here only the spontaneous fruits of the unpruned vine were to be eaten; they were*separated*, as the word also means, or “sanctified,” (Sept.) being abandoned indifferently for the use of any one that pleased to eat of them, and no longer fenced in by the proprietor, ( C.) though he might take the*first*, or choicest fruits for his own use, ( M.) or at least he might take his share like the rest. T.  
**6** *They.*Heb. and Sept. “The sabbath of the earth shall be meat for you” in common.  
**7** *Cattle.*This last term in Heb. Sept. &c. means “wild beasts,” which must also live. At this period of the seventh year debts were to be remitted, the law read, &c. Ex. 21:2. Deut. 15:2 and 31:10. But in the jubilee year, even those Hebrew slaves whose ears had been pierced, and those who had sold their land, regained their liberty and possessions. C.—Their children and wives, according to Josephus, went out with them, v. 41. Houses and suburbs for gardens, &c. might be sold for ever, if they were not redeemed the first year, excepting those of the Levites, v. 34. T.  
**8** *Years.*It is dubious whether the 49th or the 50th year was appointed for the jubilee. The former year is fixed upon by many able chronologers, who remark, that if two years of rest had occurred together, it would have been a serious inconvenience; and Moses might have said the 50th year for a round number, or comprise therein the year of the former jubilee, as we give five years to the olympiad, and eight days to the week, though the former consists only of four years, and the latter of seven days. (Rader; Scaliger; &c.) But others decide for the fiftieth year, v. 10. Philo, Joseph. iii. 10. S. Aug. q. 92. Salien, &c. C.—On the feast of expiation of the 49th year, they promulgated the following to be the year of jubilee. M.—Usher places the first A.M. 2609, 49 years after the*partition*of the land by Josue in 2560: Salien dates 50 years from the*entrance*(v. 2,) of the Hebrews into Chanaan, A.M. 2583, six years sooner; and places the first jubilee 2633, immediately after the sabbatic year, which fell in the 32nd year of Othoniel. He supposes that both were proclaimed at the same time, on the 1st of Tisri,*Ros Hassana*, “the head of the year;” though the heralds went about the country only on the 10th. The writers both of the Synagogue and of the Church generally adopt the 50th for the year of jubilee; and the pretended inconvenience of two years’ rest is nugatory, since God promised a three years’ crop, v. 21. H.  
**10** *Remission;*that is, a general release and discharge from debts and bondage, and a reinstating of every man in his former possessions. Ch.—*Jubilee:*Heb.jubolmeans “liberty” (Joseph.); “re-establishment” (Philo); ( C.)—“deliverance” (Abenezra). The Rabbins falsely assert, that a ram’s horn was used on this occasion: but Buchart shews that it is solid and unfit for the purpose. B. ii. 42. They also maintain, that from the 1st of this*sacred month*, as it is called by Philo, till the 10th, the slaves spent their time in continual rejoicings in their master’s house, and on the latter day they were set free. Cunæus (Rep. i. 6,) observes, that the jubilee was discontinued after the captivity, though the sabbatic year was still kept. C.—Indeed the Jews were often very negligent in these respects, and God complained and punished them for it. C. 27:32. &c. The avarice of the great ones chiefly caused these wise regulations to be despised, though, from time to time, God enforced their observance, that it might be clearly known from what family the Messias spring. After his birth they were abrogated, as no longer necessary. H.—Something similar was instituted by Solon, and styled “the shaking off burdens,” for the redemption both of men and good. Laertius. M.—The Locrians could not alienate their patrimony. Aristotle polit. ii. 7. and vi. 4. The Rabbins deviate from the spirit of their lawgiver, when they assert, that persons might sell their inheritance for a greater number of years than 50, if they specified how many, &c. Seld. Succes. iii. 24. In the Christian dispensation, the jubilee denotes a time of indulgence, in consequence of the power left by Jesus Christ. Matt. 16:19. 2 Cor. 2:10. The first was given by Boniface VIII. in 1300; and others were granted every century, till Clement VI. reduced the space to 50 years, 1542. Gregory XI. would have them dispensed to the faithful every 33 years, and Paul XI. every 25th, that more might partake of so great a benefit. This has been done since his time, and the Popes often grant them when the Church is in great danger, and also in the year when they are consecrated. C.—They are designed to promote the fervour of piety, and the remission of punishment due to sin. H.—*Family.*Slaves shall obtain their liberty. This law set a restraint upon the rich, that they might not get possession of too much land, or oppress the poor. Lycurgus, with the same view, established an equality of lands among the Spartans, and Solon acknowledged the propriety of the regulation, which he probably saw practised in Egypt. Diod. i. C.—The Agrarian laws at Rome, were often proposed; but they caused nothing but confusion and riot. H.  
**12** *Eat them.*No wine was to be made of the grapes, nor the corn heaped up, to the detriment of the poor. All is claimed by God, as his own property.  
**14** *Grieve.*Heb. “deceive not.” S. Chrysostom observes, that to engage another to sell us any thing for what we know is beneath its value, is theft. Grot. Jur. ii. 12. The Rabbins also decide that, if an Israelite be defrauded a sixth part, restitution must be made, v. 17. Seld. Jur. vi. 6.  
**21** *Three years.*After the harvest of the sixth year was gotten in, the land rested from September to September, the beginning of the 8th year, when it was tilled again. Nothing would be ripe till about March; yet the harvest of the 6th year would suffice to furnish food till that time, or even for a year longer, as it would be requisite, when the year of jubilee succeeded that of rest, v. 8. H.  
**23** *For ever.*Sam. version, “absolutely.” The only exception to this law is, when a person makes a vow to give some land to the Lord, and will not redeem it. C. 27:20. In that case, God re-enters upon his property, and it belongs to his priests. C.  
**27** *Fruits.*An estimation shall be made of what the buyer would probably have gotten for the fruits of the land, till the year of jubilee, and that sum shall be given to him; ( C.) or what benefit he has already derived from the land shall be computed; so that, if he purchased it for 100 sicles, and had received the value of 80, he should be content with the addition of 20 more, v. 53. H.  
**29** *City.*These houses are of greater consequence, and therefore God dissuades his people from selling them; though if they think proper to do so, he holds out an encouragement to those who buy, that they may afford a better price, on the prospect of keeping possession for ever. M.  
**33** *Owners.*The Levites had no other*possessions*, but these cities and 2000 cubits of land around them. The priests might buy of one another. Jer. 31:7.  
**35** *And thou.*Heb. “thou shalt receive him: and of the stranger … (36) take no usury.” There are two precepts; to relieve those in distress, and not to injury any one. C.  
**40** *Hireling*, who has engaged to work for a term of years, either of six, or at most 49. After the year of the jubilee, he might enter into fresh engagements with his late master. H.—The Hebrews have always hated slavery.*We have never been slaves to any.*Jo. 8:33. They were not allowed to part with their liberty, except from absolute distress; (Maimonides) and then they do not submit to what they call*intrinsical*slavery.—*Children.*His wife and children were not made slaves of him. But if his master gave him a second wife, her children belonged to their common master. Seld. Jur. vi. 1.  
**43** *Might.*Heb. “rigour*or*haughtiness.” Sept. “Do not make him strain himself with work.”  
**45** *Servants*, or slaves, whom you may treat with greater severity than the Hebrews, and keep for ever, even though they may have embraced the true faith. But still you must remember that they are your brethren.  
**47** *Stranger*, or Gentile, who engages at least to keep the precepts given to Noe. H.  
**49** *Himself.*He might have saved up something by greater industry. The Athenians allowed their slaves the same privilege. C.  
**53** *Wages.*Heb. “as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him.” What was customarily given to a hired servant for a certain number of years, might be a rule to judge how much was to be paid for redemption. H.—Thus if a man had engaged to serve 20 years for 100 sicles, and at the expiration of 10 years wished to redeem himself, he might do it for half that sum. Some think, that those Hebrews who had sold themselves to a Gentile, sojourning among them, could not take the benefit of the sabbatic year, (Ex. 21:6,) because Moses is silent on this head. But this argument is not satisfactory. C.

## Chapter 26

**1** *To adore it.*This explains the prohibition of making*graven things*, &c. The Protestants translate as usual, “Ye shall make you no idols, nor graven image, neither rear ye up a standing image, neither shall ye set up*any*image of stone in your land to bow down unto it.” They seem terribly afraid of images, as if they were all idols. See Ex. 20:4. H.—*Pillars.*Heb.mattseba, “statue,*or*monument.” Such were erected by Jacob, Josue, and even by Moses himself, without any offence or danger of idolatry. Gen. 28:18. Jos. 4:4. Ex. 24:4. Apuleius (Flor.) makes mention, among other species of superstition, “of a stone anointed, and of an altar crowned with flowers.”—The*stone*, which is here condemned, is one set up “for adoration.” Onkelos.—Heb. “a stone of sight,” placed on some eminence, or on the high roads. Strabo, (xvii.) speaking of those which he had seen in Egypt along the roads, says, “they are lofty, polished, and almost like a sphere, some 12 feet in diameter. There are sometimes three, of different dimensions, one upon another. Some were to be seen upon Mount Libanus. They were objects of adoration.” The Greeks raised heaps of stones on the high roads, in honour of Mercury. Prov. 26:7. C.—We are not forbidden to place land-marks, &c.: but we must not adore them. D.  
**2** *Reverence.*The Rabbins inform us, with what respect their ancestors appeared in the temple. They left their sticks and shoes behind them, and washed their feet; entering solely to perform some act of religion, and not to go a shorter road to another street. When they had ended their devotions, they retired slowly without turning their back to the sanctuary. Outram, Sacrif. lib. 3. n. 7.  
**3** *Due seasons.*Before harvest, in spring; and after that in autumn, when they sow their wheat and barley in Palestine. C.  
**5** *Time.*So great shall be the abundance, that you will scarcely have time to get all the work done before you will be called off to something else. H.—These promises would be so much the more agreeable to them, as in Egypt they had been forced to keep in their houses two or three months together, on account of the overflowing of the Nile. In that country, as well as in Greece and Palestine, people sow both wheat and barley about October; while in other countries the latter is sown in spring. The harvest is ready in about six months, and that of wheat in seven. Plin. xiii. 19. Hesiod, ep. 2. C.  
**8** *Five.*Thus Gedeon’s 300 men put to flight the great army of the Madianites; (Jud. 7:22,) and the Machabees destroyed vast numbers with a small force.  
**10** *Old;*Being unable to consume all. M.—Heb. “ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.” Sept. “you shall eat the old of old, and you shall bring out the old from the face of the new.”*Like a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasury new things and old.*Matt. 13:52. H.  
**13** *Upright;*and be no longer bowed down with a heavy yoke, like oxen. “I have broken the locks of your prison, and have set you at liberty.” Arab. C.—A Greek proverb says, “Never was a slave’s head right, but always crooked, like his neck.” M.  
**16** *Heat.*Heb.kaddachath, is rendered “scab and jaundice,” by the Sept.: and by others “a dangerous wind,” like that which causes so many diseases in Egypt. The precise meaning of some terms in this verse is not well known.  
**18** *More*, (*septuplum**.*) “Very often,*or*very much;” in which sense it is used in this chapter. C.  
**19** *As brass*(*æneam*). “Brazen,” without moisture, and barren. Onkelos.  
**22** *Desolate*, none being left to frequent them; or the few who remain, shall keep within doors, lest the wild beasts should meet and devour them. Isai. 33:8.  
**26** *Bread;*or that which supports you. You shall be deprived of the necessaries of life.—*One oven*shall be used by 10 families, so little bread shall be baked, and even that little shall be delivered out by weight. I will also deprive it of its nutritive qualities, so that it shall not satisfy your craving appetite. C. See Ps. 104:16. Isai. 3:1.  
**28** *Fury.*You will gain nothing by opposing me, but your own destruction. I will treat you, as you would deal with me. H.  
**29** *Daughters.*To such extremities were the Jews reduced, at the sieges of Samaria and Jerusalem. 4 K. 6:28 Lament. 4:10. Josep. Bel. vii. 8.  
**30** *Places.*The temple of Solomon was built on Mount Moria or Sion. The Persians sacrificed upon the mountains, and the Romans and Athenians built their most magnificent temples on the highest parts of their respective cities.—*Idols.*Heb.chammanim, denotes the chariots dedicated to the sun; (4 K. 23:11,) or thepyreia, or enclosures for the sacred fire, in honour of the god Homanus, (Strabo xv.) whose name is probably derived from this Hebrew word, ( C.) as well as Hammon, a title of Jupiter. M.—*Ruins.*Heb. “and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your gods of dirt, and my soul shall vomit you out.” The Egyptians embalmed the carcasses of their sacred animals. God threatens that, if his people be so stupid as to adore them, they shall die, and be deprived of sepulture.  
**31** *Odours.*Even the sanctuary of the Lord shall be destroyed, as you will be unworthy to have it among you, or to offer sacrifices to me. H.  
**34** *Desolation.*It shall be uncultivated; and though you would not comply with my injunctions to let it rest one year out of seven, it shall now remain desolate for many years together. H.—Theodoret (q. 37,) says for 70 years; the number of sabbatic years, from the reign of Saul till the captivity of Babylon, during the space of 490 years. This verse seems evidently to allude to those days of distress. C. 2 Par. 36:21.—But we can hardly suppose that none of the sabbatic years should have been duly observed during the reigns of David, Solomon, &c. H.—Instead of*enjoy*, Heb. may be “shall expiate her sabbaths,” or the neglect of them. The same term,tirtse, is used, (v. 41. 43,) and the Vulg. generally renders it*agreeable*, speaking of sacrifices. C. 1:4. 22:20. C.  
**35** *Your sabbaths*, holidays and years of rest, and of jubilee. The earth is represented as entering into the views of God, and rejoicing at his judgments. H.  
**36** *Fear.*Sept. “timidity,*or*slavishness.” Heb.morec, “softness*and*inactivity.” C.—Their haughty temper shall be broken; and though they have dared to rebel against their God, the fall of a leaf shall now terrify them. H.  
**37** *Brethren*, in their flight; while each one is endeavouring to save himself. The Rabbins say they shall be punished for the sins of their brethren, if they have not endeavoured to prevent them.  
**38** *Consume you.*The Hebrew spies said that the land of Chanaan devoured its inhabitants. Such shall be in reality the enemies’ country in your regard. You shall not be able to establish yourselves or be happy there.  
**39** *Own.*The sins of their fathers, which they have imitated, shall fall upon them; so that they shall pine away with remorse and misery.  
**41** *Mind.*Heb. “heart,” wicked, rebellious, and unclean. M.—*Pray for.*Heb. and Syr. “please themselves in,” &c. They shall see what advantage they have derived from their sins. C.—Then they shall enter into themselves, like the prodigal son. H.  
**42** *Jacob*is placed first because he was the father of no other nation; as Abraham and Isaac were. W.  
**44** *I did not.*He speaks of a future event, which he sees will certainly come to pass, as if it had already happened. As God had preserved his people, in Egypt, conformably to his covenant with the patriarchs, so he will be reconciled to them, after they shall have done penance, and acknowledged all their excesses, in the captivity of Babylon. H.—The church never ceases all together. W.  
**45** *Mose**s.*What has been hitherto recorded, was mostly prescribed by God at Mount Sinai, as some of the following laws were also. C.—It would seem as if this were the conclusion of Leviticus. We must remember, however, that these divisions were not introduced by Moses, as he wrote his five books without any interruption, like one verse. So S. John seems to conclude his Gospel, (C. 20:31) though he afterwards adds another chapter. H.

## Chapter 27

**2** *Estimation.*Heb. is obscure. “Whoever has separated, or made a singular vow; the souls to the Lord according to thy estimation.” C.—Sept. “shall vow as it were the price of a soul to the Lord.” H.—The person or the beast shall belong to the Lord; but if it be redeemed, the priests shall fix a price, according to the following regulations. Whatever was vowed must be subject to these rules, or it shall remain for the service of the altar. The priests may sell it, if it be an impure animal. Those which are fit for sacrifice, were to be immolated, v. 9, &c. No change of them was allowed, lest a worse should ever be substituted for a better; ( C.) and because God is better pleased with things that are offered to him by vow. W.  
**5** *Fifth.*The parents might make a vow of their children. M.  
**8** *The estimation.*Heb. is pointed improperly, “thy estimation;” for the price was fixed already. The priest had leave to reduce it only in favour of the poor. Houbigant. See v. 2, and seq.  
**13** *That offereth it.*This addition of the Vulgate shews, that if any other purchased the animal, he would not have to give a fifth part more than the value. That only concerned the person who had made the vow, to punish him for his inconstancy, and that he might not have a desire to get possession again of what he had once consecrated to the Lord. If the beast was valued at 40 sicles, he would therefore have to pay 50. C.  
**15** *House.*The Rabbins say this fifth part went towards repairing the temple. We may suppose it was laid on to indemnify the priests, for the loss which they sustained by selling a house, or*a field*, (v. 16,) to the former owner; since if any other had purchased them, the priests would have been able to sell them again at the return of every jubilee. At that period, even the former proprietor would not obtain a title to possess them for ever; (v. 21,) and therefore he would not need to pay any more than the stated value. Tostat. C.  
**16** *Pos**session*, or inheritance. If he had only purchased the field, he could not, by his vow, transfer the property of it to the priests beyond the year of jubilee, v. 22.—*Seed*, not of the produce, which is uncertain. The goodness of the soil must also be considered.—*Silver:*which rent must be paid every year, except on those of*rest*, when the earth was not cultivated. C.  
**21** *Consecrated.*Heb. “a field of anathema,” devoted and separated from common uses for ever*to the Lord.*H.—*Priests.*They were bound to sell it from one jubilee to another to some of the same tribe, to which the person, who vowed it, had belonged. M.—In the new law, religious people often consecrate themselves and their effects to the service of God; and it would be a sacrilege to alienate them from such pious uses to any thing profane. They are*anathema*, a deposit of offering to the Lord; while those who violate them, are*anathema*, accursed. H. T.  
**25** *Obols.*Heb. “gerah.” which were worth 1d.-2687; so that a sicle amounts to 2s. 3d.-375. Arbuthnot.  
**26** *First-born.*Sept. add “a beasts.” Men, though belonging to the Lord on that title already, (Ex. 13:2,) might still be more particularly consecrated to him by vow, as Samuel was. C.—A vow must be concerning some greater good to which we are not otherwise bound. Such vows are agreeable to God, and can never be broken without sin. See Gen. 31:13. 1 Tim. 5:12. W.  
**27** *Unclean*, either on account of some blemish, or because it is of those species which cannot be sacrificed; such as the horse, camel, &c. which might nevertheless be vowed to the Lord, and sold for the benefit of his priests.—*By thee.*Moses and the succeeding priests. Many MSS. read, with the Sept. and Chal. “by him,” leaving the matter to the person’s conscience; but the printed Hebrew and Vulgate agree. C.  
**28** *Devoted.*Heb. “anathema,” different from the other vows. In this case all that had life was slain, (or consecrated to God, H.) houses were demolished, the land belonged to the priests for ever, so that they could only let it out to laymen for a certain rent. Moses thus devoted the Amalecites to destruction; (Ex. 17:14,) and Saul had orders to put in execution what he had denounced, 1 K. 15. It is doubtful whether people could thus devote their children and slaves. Most authors suppose, that it was necessary that God or the nation at large should pronounce such a sentence, as was done with respect to Achan. Jos. 8. See Num. 21:2. Judg. 11:31. C.  
**29** *Die.*Grotius says, only public enemies and deserters could be thus devoted. Other men and women were only consecrated for ever to the divine service. D.  
**30** *Tithes.*Abraham and Jacob paid tithes, out of devotion. Gen. 14 and 28:22. Moses first made a law on this subject, which began to be in force when the Hebrews had obtained quiet possession of Chanaan. The people paid them more exactly when they were determined to keep God’s law, and had pious princes at their head. 2 Par. 31:5. At other times they were very negligent. Mal. 3:10. This forced Esdras to appoint inspectors,Namnim, to collect them. The Pharisees affected a decree of exactitude in this respect, (Lu. 11:42. Matt. 23:23,) paying what some Jews do not suppose to be necessary, though our Saviour says it was. Since the destruction of the temple the Jews pay none. The first-fruits and tithes of wheat, barley, figs, raisins, olives, pomegranates, and dates, were required, though it be not certain what quantity of the first-fruits was given; some say between the 40th and the 60th part of the produce. Wine and wool were also to be offered. The tithes were taken after the first-fruits and the heaved oblations (thorume) were paid. They belonged to the Levites, and these gave a tithe to the priests. Num. 18:28. See C. 19:24. The Eastern kings required a tithe of their subjects, for the support of their families. 1 K. 8:15. God does the like. Mal. 3:10. The Persians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, and even the Arabs and Scythians, religiously paid their tithes in honour of their false gods. See Cyrop. iv. and Q. Curtius iv. 2. Herod. ii. 135. Plin. xii. 14. Mela. ii. 5, &c. The Romans often consecrate the tithes of their spoils to Hercules, as the Carthaginians did also. The Scythians sent them to Apollo. Solin 27, &c. C.—Scaliger and Amama dispose the tithes, and the oblations of the Hebrews, in the following order. Supposing a person’s annual produce amount to 6000 bushels, an oblation (thorume) of at least 100 was to be made to the priests: out of the remaining 5900, a first tithe of 590 belonged to the Levites, out of which they paid 59 to the priests. The residue, of 5310 bushels, paid a second tithe of 531, to be consumed in feasts in the temple, (a custom which the ancient Christians imitated in their love-feasts, called*agape.*C.) The original produce was thus reduced to 4779 bushels; and both the tithes amounted to 1121 and the oblation to 100. The thorume consisted of flour dressed, and of oil, wine (Amama) and wool, ( C.) to be given to the priests on the feast of Pentecost. C. 23:15. It could not be less than the 60th part of the produce, (Ezec. 45:13) and it was necessary to pay it before any could be used in the family. Hence these oblations are often called*first-fruits*, and have been confounded with those sheaves which were to be offered at the beginning of harvest. Amama.  
**31** *Of them.*When the distance from Jerusalem was great, so that a person judged it more convenient to sell his tithes, and with the money purchase more for a feast in Jerusalem, (which the Rabbins call*Zudui, Charisterion*, grace or thanksgiving) he had to pay something additional, 12, for example, instead of 10. Scaliger.  
**32** *Rod;*on which was some red colouring, to mark the tenth animal as it passed through a narrow gate. If it was proper for sacrifice, its blood was poured out around the altar, and its flesh was returned to the giver. If it could not be offered in sacrifice, it was slain. The priest received none of the victim, no more than the paschal lamb. Outram, sac. i. 11. But a feast was made of flesh for the person’s friends, and he gave a portion to the poor and to the Levites.—*The Lord*, as a sacrifice of thanksgiving, in which the greatest part of the victim is consumed by the person who offers it. The priests have but a small share. C. 3. C.  
**34** *Sinai.*The laws specified in the ten first chapters of the following book, were given here also. H.
