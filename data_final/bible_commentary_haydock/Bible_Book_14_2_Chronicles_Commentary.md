# 2 Chronicles Commentary

As the former Book shews how David was chosen to rule over God’s peculiar people, so this explains briefly the reign of Solomon, in the nine first chapters; and in the rest, that of nineteen of his successors, who governed two tribes till the captivity, while Israel was divided. W.

## Chapter 1

**5** *Sought it:* went ( M.) to offer sacrifice, ( T.) in the second year of his reign, A.C. 1013.  
**6** *Victims.* Heb. “holocausts,” either with his own hand, or by the ministry of the priests. See 1 K. 13:12. C.  
**7** *Night*, after the victims had been offered. On this occasion, Solomon made this prayer, and was heard. 3 K. 3:5. C.  
**10** *People*, as a king ought to do. M.  
**13** **Ve** **r.** **13** **.** *Before.* Heb. and Sept. “from before the tabernacle,” which was at Gabaon. there was another at Jerusalem, where ( H.) Solomon rendered homage to the Lord. C.  
**14** *Chariots.* See 3 K. 4:26. No king of Israel kept such a multitude of horses. C.  
**15** *Sycamores* are trees of small value, and not good for building. T.  
**16** *Coa* may signify either some city, (Mariana) or an “exporium,” where things are sold, as kuch means “a collection.” T. 3 K. 10:28. Neglecting the points of the Masorets, we may well understand Coa, a city of Egypt, or an island of the Mediterranean. The Masorets read Mikve, instead of Micoa. D.

## Chapter 2

**1** *Himself*, worthy of his great empire. He deemed that which David had built too mean, though that pious king had been ashamed to dwell in such a magnificent palace, while the ark of God was under skins. 2 K. 7:2. C.  
**2** *Numbered*, of the proselytes, v. 17. T.—*Hew.* The stones were made ready for use, as well as the wood, before it was brought to the temple. 3 K. 6:7.—*Six.* Only *three* are mentioned 3 K. 5:16. C.—But three hundred overseers of higher order are here included. T.  
**6** *Before him.* For this purpose do I design to build. M.—Temples are more for our use than for God’s, as none can be worthy of him. C.  
**7** *Purple.* Heb. argevan, ( H.) a Chal. word, of the same import as *argueman*, in Exodus.—*Scarlet* and *blue* were also species of purple. The finest sort was found between Tyre and Carmel. See Vitruv. vii. 13.  
**8** *Pine.* Heb. algum, which rather denotes a species of fir, than the juniper-tree; though the domestic kind was tall, and used in edifices. C.—*Arceuthina*, “juniper,” is taken from the Sept. D.  
**9** *Exceedingly.* Heb. “wonderfully great.” H.  
**10** *Wheat.* Heb. adds, “beaten.”—*Barley* and *wine* are not specified 3 K. 5:11. C.—*Measures*, like the Roman amphora, contained 960 ozs. A. Lapide—Heb. has, “batim,” in both places; but 3 K. we find, “twenty cores of oil.” The *satum*, “measure,” was only one-third of the bath or epha. C.  
**13** *Father.* Heb. Abi, is considered by some as the surname of Hiram. Pagnin, &c.—But he might have that title in consideration of his great skill, as Solomon gives it him. C. 4:16. We use master in the same sense. Sept. have, “servant,” (παιδα) except the Roman edition, which agrees with the Heb. and reads, πατερα. C.—Prot. “of Huram, my father’s;” ( H.) supply servant, or architect. T.  
**14** Dan, the city, as the widow as of the tribe of Nephthali. D.—*Whose.* Heb. “and his father,” ( H.) or “this Abi.” C. See 3 K. 7:14.—*Silk.* Heb. “byssus,” which is the silk extracted from a fish, and not the fine linen of Egypt, or cotton which as sometimes this appellation. 1 Par. 15:27.—*My lord*, a term of civility.  
**16** *Floats.* So the Sept. well express the Heb. raphsodoth, which seems to be borrowed from the Greek Ραψωδια, which denotes a collection of verses ( C.) and was applied to Homer’s poems, before they were collected. Ælian xiii. 14. *Joppe* was a port much used, ( C.) though dangerous. Joseph. Bel. iii. 15.  
**17** *Had made*, at the commencement of Solomon’s reign, when David put such immense treasures into his hands. The second list was taken when the temple was begun. The *proselytes* were the remnants of the nations of the natives of Chanaan. The Jews foolishly pretend, ( C.) that no strangers were allowed to embrace the law of Moses, under David and Solomon, for fear lest they might be influenced by self-interest rather than by the love of religion. Seldon, Syn. iii. 2. 5.  
**18** *Six.* We read *three*, 3 K. 5:16.: people who where strangers, as the Israelites were not forced to work. C. 8:9. C.

## Chapter 3

**1** *Moria*, which signifies vision; ( C.) the place pointed out to Abraham, (Gen. 22:2. S. Aug. de C. xvi. 32.) and to David. 1 Par. 21:15 and 22:1.  
**2** *Second.* Heb. adds, ( D.) “in the second *day* of the second month.” Prot. &c. H.  
**3** *By the first*, or ancient *measure*, used before the captivity. The Babylonian cubit was a hand smaller, as Ezechiel (40:3) intimates. C.—Solomon used the same cubit as Moses, but doubled the proportions. M.  
**4** *A hundred.* The Arab. and some copies of the Sept. read only twenty. Capellus and Toinard would substitute, ten cubits. A small change in the Heb. might occasion these variations. C.—In 3 K. 7:2 we find the height was thirty cubits: but that might be only to the first floor. Many think that the temple was 120 cubits high: but Salien ( A. 3024) explains it of the four-square tower, ( M.) in the front. C.  
**5** *House.* between the most holy place and the porch, ( T.) or it may comprise all but the porch. Heb. “he covered (or boarded) all this great house.” C.—*Deal boards* interspersed with those of cedar. 3 K. 6:9. T.—*Fine*, (*obrizi* *.*) Heb. “of Parvaim, which is probably the same as Sepharvaim, Ophir, &c. not far from Media and Colchis. C.  
**8** *Amounting to about*, is not in Heb. H.  
**9** *Sicles.* This weight seems enormous for each nail. Mariana supposes every nail weighed one sicle. But who will believe that only fifty were used? Heb. “And the weight of the nails was fifty,” &c. The Syr. and Arab. omit this verse entirely.—*Chambers*, or rather “the ceiling.”  
**10** *Work.* Heb. “of the work of young men,” or resembling them. Munster—Sept. “the work of wood.” Vulg. lit. “of sculpture work,” ( H.) as Le Clerc renders the original. Some moderns translate, “of a work like men in motion.” Mariana, Buxtorf—The cherubims were in an erect posture.  
**11** *Cubits*, comprising the breadth of their body. Each occupied ten cubits.  
**13** *Toward.* Heb. “inward;” looking at each other, (Ex. 25:20) or towards the altar of holocausts.  
**14** *A veil.* Abulensis places it between the court and the holy: but Jansenius would have it before the holy of holies. It seems rather that there was a veil in both places, (Barad. t. ii. b. iii. 23. M.) as Josephus (viii. 2 and xii. 10.) clearly intimates; and S. Paul speaks of the *second veil.* Heb. 9:3. It is not certain which of them was torn at the death of Jesus Christ. Matt. 27:51. *Cherubims;* extraordinary figures. C.  
**15** *Five.* 3 K. 7:15 we read *each was eighteen cubits.* It is probable that each was 17½ and the other half was for the crown, ( C.) or cornice. H.  
**16** *In*, or “as in.” Sa. M.—Protestants supply *as.* H.—*Hundred*, for one row, or 200 for both. 3 K. D.  
**17** *Booz.* “Stability and strength” are derived from God alone. Thus Solomon designed to insinuate that God established the harmony of the universe. H.—An orrery, or globe, was therefore placed on each of these pillars. Parkhurst, in *con.*

## Chapter 4

**1** *Altar* of holocausts, much larger than that of Moses. The one which was built after the captivity, was a square of fifteen cubits. This of Solomon was only ten in height. A sloping ascent was made up to it, according to Josephus; (Bel. vi. 5. or v. 14.) or the steps were closed in, if we believe others. See Ex. 27:1 and 20:26. It is thought ( C.) that the inside of the altar was filled with earth, ( M.) or with rough stones: (Ex. 20:24. D.) but that is not certain, with regard to the brazen altar. See 1 Mac. 4:44, 47. C.  
**2** *Sea*, or great brazen vessel, and some other things that were not in the tabernacle of Moses, whose plan was followed, but with greater magnificence. W.  
**3** *Oxen.* In 3 K. 7:24 we read Heb. “knops,” ( H.) or “apples.”—*Of ten.* Heb. “ten in a cubit.” Hence there must have been 600 heads of oxen, as the sea was thirty cubits in circumference, and there were two rows. C.—Others suppose that here were only five in each row, or only one in each cubit. See Vat. and 3 K. The Sept. and Syr. omit this verse. C.—Yet it is found in the best editions of the Sept. H.  
**4** *Cast.* Heb. adds, “when it (the sea) was cast.” H.—They were done at the same time, ( T.) and were perhaps intended to let out the water. The twelve oxen, which supported the sea, were not cast along with it. D.  
**5** *Three.* 3 K. *two*, may specify the usual quantity that was contained, though the vessel would absolutely hold a thousand measures, or baths, more. H.  
**6** *Holocaust*, as well as all the necessary utensils.—*Priests.* They did not bathe in the sea, but drew water into other vessels. The Chal. supposes that the work of Beseleel was for the high priest alone. C.  
**9** *Hall*, (*basilicam* *.*) Sept. use the same term (αυλη) as just before is rendered *court;* and the Prot. make no distinction, though the Heb. terms be different. Sept. render *chatsar*, “the court” of the people. There, we know, that Solomon had his tribune. C. 6:13. Ezechiel (43:14) distinguishes two; the great, lower or outward, ( H. *chatsar*) or court, and that of the priests, ( H.) which he styles the less, &c. The principal door lay to the east.  
**10** *Right*, though to the left of those who entered the temple.  
**12** *Pommels*, (epistylia.) Heb. “cordons,” or rows of pomegranates, (3 K. 7:18) each consisting of one hundred; so that at the two pillars were adorned with a double row, both together would have four hundred. C.—The precise number is fixed at ninety-six for each row. Jer. 52:23. T.  
**16** *His father.* Heb. Abib, which is considered by some as a surname, ( M.) or the title may be given to Hiram, on account of his skill. C.—He is so called by the king of Tyre, (C. 2:13) for having instructed him in the true faith. W.  
**17** *Saredatha*, or Sarthan, (3 K. 7:46) not far from Bethsan. 3 K. 4:12. C.  
**21** *Flowers.* They represented lilies or other flowers ( T.) full-blown, when the lamps were burning. All the branches were of pure gold. C.  
**22** *Mortars*, to hold the fine flour. M.—*And thus.* Here the fifth chapter commences, in Heb. and Sept.  

---

## Chapter 5

**1** *God*, under the care of Selemith. See 1 Par. 26:26. C.  
**2** *Ark.* Another was not made, as that was most sacred and excellent. W.  
**3** *Day*, the eighth. 3 K. 8:2.  
**4** *Levites*, with the *priests* alternately; (ibid.) or the latter were all Levites, ( C.) though higher in dignity, in the same manner as our bishops are priests.  
**5** *With the.* “And” is omitted in Heb. but supplied by Prot. &c. from 3 K. H.  
**9** *Oracle*, pushing out the veil, ( H.) in the tabernacle of Moses, but not in the temple, which was of larger dimensions. C.—*But if.* Heb. “but they were not seen without. And there it is till this day.”  
**10** *Ark.* See 3 K. 8:9. H.—The other things which had been placed in, or at least on the side of the ark, were now removed to the treasury rooms. T.  
**11** **V** **er.** **11** **.** *Sanctified;* free from all legal impediments to offer sacrifice. H.—*Divided.* Heb. “observed.” T.—Prot. “and they did not *then* wait by course,” which was the case also with the singers, &c. on this solemn occasion; as the number regulated by David for each week, would not have been sufficient. H.—The regulation had not yet been reduced to practice. M. C.—*As yet* ( D.) *at that time*, is omitted ( H.) by the Sept. ( D.) and Heb.  
**12** *Linen*, or “robes of silk.” Prot. “white linen.” H.  
**14** *Cloud.* See 3 K. 8:10. M.—It is called the *glory of the Lord*, because its appearance was luminous and awful, being a symbol of the divine presence. H.  

---

## Chapter 6

**1** *Cloud:* lit. “darkness.” H.—The promise had been made to Moses. Ex. 16:10 and 40:32. C.—God thus manifested his presence. W.  
**12** *Hands.* Such external gestures promote attention in prayer; and hence were much used by holy people, at all times. W.  
**13** *Scaffold*, (*basim* *.*) The Heb. (kiyor) is used for “a shell, (*concha* *.* T.) or bowl,” as the throne was probably of the same form, and was placed on a square pedestal, at the higher end of the court of the people, ( C.) which is here styled the *temple*, (basilicæ) or “hall.” C. 4:9. Sept. αυλης. Heb. chatsar, which denotes that great court where ( H.) the body of the people stood bare-headed, before the Lord, (Grot. &c. C. 20:5) in the open air. D.—We are assured that the king himself never sat in his tribune. C.—Others reserve that privilege to him alone. H.—While he addressed the people, he turned towards them.  
**19** *End.* Temples are erected for the convenience of men. C.—Solomon hopes that God will reward his good intentions.  
**22** *Altar;* thus solemnly consenting to be punished by God, if he swear falsely. H.—This practice was not prescribed by the law, but took place when witnesses could not be procured, or when it was necessary to rely on the word of the accused.  
**28** *Blasting, or mildew*, (*ærugo & aurugo* *.*) The first has the colour of brass, the other of gold. both have nearly the same import. M.—One of the terms is rendered, corrupt air; (3 K. 8:37. C.) as this is one of the great causes why both plants and animals do not thrive. Sept. “corruption of the air and king’s evil, *or* yellow jaundice:” ικτερος. H.  
**29** *Any.* Heb. adds, “man, or thy people.” Sept. “and (*that is*) to thy.” See v. 32. H.—Both strangers and Israelites may there sue for mercy, and obtain it. C.—From this chapter, as well as from many other passages, it is evident that places consecrated to God, are more acceptable to him than other places; ( W.) and here the prayers of the faithful are sooner heard, as they testify their unity. D.  
**31** *Fear thee*, being filled with awe at the sight of thy judgments. C.  
**33** *House*, that they may know that this is not only called, but is, in effect, the temple of the Lord, where he will display his power and goodness. H.  
**38** *Name.* Hence arose the custom of turning towards Jerusalem and the temple, when the Jews poured for their supplications, in any country. 3 K. 8:44.  
**41** *Now, therefore.* This is taken from Ps. 131:8. 9. 10. ( M.) almost word for word. We do not find that Solomon spoke this, 3 K. C.—*Place:* lit. “rest.” H.—Come, O Lord, and dwell here.—*Strength*, by which thy wonders shine forth, and thy enemies are dismayed. The ark is styled *the strength* of Israel, Ps. 77:61 and 62:3.; and in the parallel passage we read, *Thou and the ark* of they sanctification, or sanctuary, which is its highest ornament, and *which thou hast sanctified*, or required to be treated with respect.—*Salvation*, or *justice*, (Ps. 131) which is the surest method of obtaining happiness.  
**42** *Anointed.* Cover not with shame the king, whom thou hast appointed, ( H.) nor reject my prayer. T.—*Mercies*, which thou hast shewn, or rather ( C.) the acts of virtue which thy servant displayed. Syr. &c. *For thy servant David’s sake, turn not away the face of thy anointed.* Ps. 131. In consideration of his merits, grant my request. C.—Even Solomon, though at this time the object of God’s complacency, disdains not to screen himself under the merits of the departed saints. H.

## Chapter 7

**2** *Majesty;* the cloud. For some time the priests were obliged to keep at a distance. They afterwards offered up many victims. C.  
**3** *Glory.* The same word was before rendered *majesty.* H.  
**4** *Victims*, by the hands of the priests: or they slew them themselves, and presented the blood and fat to be placed on the altar by the priests.  
**5** *Rams*, including sheep and goats.—*People*, each in their proper sphere. The priests had the chief part, as the ministers of religion. The solemnity continued for a week, and many altars were erected in the court. C.  
**6** *Which* music, or Psalms, (*carminum*) David had composed. H.—*Because.* This was the chorus of the 135th Psalm, which was sung on this occasion by some, while others played on their musical instruments. C.—Lit. “*singing* by their hands.” Prot. “when David praised by their ministry.” H.—As the temple was chosen by God for the place of prayer, so special forms of blessing, &c. are more agreeable to him. W.  
**9** *Solemnity* of tabernacles, ( M.) which ensued after the dedication was ended.  
**10** *Day.* He had given them leave to depart, the day before. 3 K. 8:66.  
**14** *Face*, to appease me, that I may look down upon them in mercy. C.  

---

## Chapter 8

**1** *After.* Sept. “in which.”  
**2** *Given* back ( T.) as he refused to accept of the present. Some think that ( C.) Hiram gave these cities in exchange for the others. Salien. M.  
**3** **V** **er.** **3** **.** Emath, or Emesa, on the Orontes. This city had belonged to Thou, who cultivated the friendship of David. 2 K. 8:9. But after the death of these princes, it had given some offence to Solomon, who took it, as well as Palmira, or Thadmor, though not perhaps in person.  
**4** *Strong.* Heb. “the cities of tents.” Ex. 1:11. C.—Prot. “store cities,” ( H.) for corn, &c.  
**8** *Tributaries.* Heb. also, “to work,” at cutting stones, &c. 1 Par. 22:2. Some of their descendants returned from captivity. Ib. 9:2.  
**10** *Fifty.* These were different from the 550 overseers. 3 K. 9:23.  
**11** *Into it.* It was deemed improper for a pagan woman to reside in the same place. C.—She had perhaps pretended, at first, to be converted, but had lately given some signs of relapse. Salien.—Solomon was as yet far from communicating with infidels. W.  
**14** *And gate*, at their respective posts. See 1 Par. 26. H.  
**15** *Treasures.* The regulations of David were exactly observed. C.  
**17** *Asiongaber*, which was called Bernice, (Joseph. viii. 2.) and now Suez. T.  
**18** *Ships;* not perhaps from Tyre, but from the Red Sea. C.—Others think that he sent them by a canal, which opened a communication between the Mediterranean and Suez, (Huet) the distance of about ninety miles. Pliny ii. 68.—But this canal seems to have been made after the age of Solomon. Hence others imagine that the ships were taken in pieces, or conveyed by land, as has been sometimes done. Mahomet II. transported ships across the isthmus of Corinth. Alexander the Great conveyed on chariots the ships which had been used to cross the Indus, as far as the Hydaspes. Arrian vii. C.—*Skilful mariners.* They were the most expert, and the inventers of navigation. *Prima ratem ventis tradere docta Tyrus* *.* Tibul. See Wisd. 14:6.—*Ophir*, the kingdom of Pegu, in the East Indies, ( T.) or some other distant land. H.—*Fifty.* Thirty are omitted, 3 K. 9:28, as they were expended in the voyage. C.—Yet the Heb. letters for twenty and fifty are extremely similar. D.  

---

## Chapter 9

**1** *Saba.* See 3 K. 10:1. This queen resided in Arabia or Abyssinia. H.—*Questions.* They were not of a trifling nature, as she is commended by Christ. D.  
**3** *House;* the royal palace, or rather the temple, which was much more magnificent than any thing in the East.  
**5** *Virtues.* Heb. “words,” or of what regards thee ( C.) and thy exploits. T.  
**6** *Fame.* Heb. and Sept. “the fame which I had heard.” H.  
**8** *King of the Lord.* Hence the style, “By the grace of God, king of England,” &c. has been adopted. Those deserve the name, who rule according to God’s will. W.—The kings of the Jews were more properly lieutenants of God, as the government was a theocracy. C. 13:8. &c.  
**10** *Thyine-trees*, very odoriferous. C.—Heb. algumim: 3 K. almugim, as the letters are frequently transposed in Heb. D.—Huet thinks these were citron-trees, which did not produce fruit, but were used to make costly tables, and were a species of cedar.  
**11** *Stairs.* Heb. “hands,” ( D.) or banisters, from the palace to the temple. Junius.  
**12** *And many.* Heb. “besides *that* which she had brought unto the king.” Prot. It is however certain that Solomon made use of many of her presents, and therefore he returned her others in greater profusion, or, as it is expressed, 3 K. *besides what he offered her of himself of his royal bounty.* H.  
**13** *Gold*, each worth 5475*l.* (Arbuthnot) so that this part of the revenue alone would amount to 3,646,350*l.* sterling, annually. H.  
**14** *Beside.* Heb. “besides *that which* chapmen and merchants brought.” Prot. The *deputies* appear to be the tax-gatherers. 3 K. 10:15. H.  
**16** *Pieces.* In 3 K. we read, *three pounds.*—*Wood;* or, “in the palace of the forest of Libanus,” (3 K. 10:17. C.) as it is expressed in the Sept. T.  
**18** *Arms.* Prot. “stays.” H.—Heb. in 3 K. seems clearer and more correct. C.  
**20** *Days.* We sometimes find the figure, hyperbole, used in Scripture for things unusual. C. 1:16. W.  
**21** Tharsis*.* Any distant place was so called. T.  
**25** *Thousand.* In 3 K. we read, 1400 *chariots;* and here Heb. has, “4000 stables, ( C.) *or* stalls for horses and chariots;” (Prot.) and the Sept. “4000 mares for the chariots, and 12,000 horsemen.” H.—There might be ten horses in each stable. D.  
**29** *Seer.* The works of these three are not extant. M.—The fall of Solomon is recorded, 3 K. 11. W.  

---

## Chapter 10

**7** *Please.* 3 K. 12. “serve.” By a little condescension, thou mayst establish thy throne. C.—The people did not complain, till they saw the riches of the nation wasted on wicked women ( T.) and idols. D.  
**11** *Scorpions;* thorns, or scourges armed with hooks. Colum. iii. 10.—Roboam had not sense to despise the foolish advice of the young men. T.  
**15** *Will of God:* not that the king should act foolishly, or the people rebel, but to effect what he had promised. H.—Syriac has well expressed the sense: “because this rebellion happened by the divine permission, that they might behold the truth of the prediction of Ahias;” ( C.) and that the fault of Solomon might be punished. D.  
**16** *People.* Heb. “and when all Israel *saw* that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying: What portion have we in David?” Prot.—*Dwellings.* Many ancient Latin MSS. here insert 3 K. 12:20. Lyran. &c. C.  

---

## Chapter 11

**1** *Chosen.* Sept. “young,” ( H.) as the Heb. term also signifies. T.—*His.* Heb. “the kingdom again to Roboam.”  
**4** *Will*, to punish the disorders of Solomon, &c. See 3 K. 12:24. Gen. 45:8. God knows how to draw good out of evil, without approving the misconduct of men. H.  
**5** *Juda.* This was now become a frontier country, and both kings were forced to erect fortifications. 3 K. 12:25.  
**6** *Etam*, famous for fine waters and gardens, (Joseph. viii. 2.) about ten miles from Jerusalem, on the road to Hebron. It was fortified against the inroads of Simeon and Dan. C.  
**11** **Ve** **r.** **11** **.** *Governors*, of a military character. Heb. “captains, ( T.) and store of provisions, (wheat) and of oil,” &c. such as would be requisite in a siege.  
**14** *Off.* This was done at different times; so that almost all the Levites took refuge in the dominions of Juda. Yet some prevaricated. Ezechiel (44:12) only exempts the family of Sadoc. C.—The rest set before us a noble example to endure temporal loss, rather than to neglect the practice of religion, or to conform to a false one. W.  
**15** *Devils.* Heb. “goats.” C.—Sept. express this by two names, “for the idols, and for the fools.” H.—The Mendesians of Egypt, solemnly worshipped the goat; and Pan was represented nearly in the same form. Yet it is probable that the Hebrews style the idols by this name out of derision. 3 K. 15:2. C.  
**17** **V** **er.** **17** **.** *They*, the pious refugees. T. C. 15:9.—*Solomon*, while virtuous.—*Only* is not expressed in Heb. or Sept. but it is sufficiently implied.  
**18** *Daughter.* Heb. ban, “the son.” But *bath*, “daughter,” ( H.) occurs properly in some MSS. as in the ancient versions. Leusden has here this very odd note: “perhaps by ban, (with a pathah) here both sexes may be understood.” *Forte per* ban *hic intelligit* *ur uterque sexus* *.* Kennicott—Prot. substitute, “daughter.” H.  
**20** *Daughter*, or grand-daughter, by Thamar. 3 K. 15:2. C.  
**22** *Head.* Sept. “prince.” H.—Grotius maintains that Abia was the eldest. But all others are of a contrary opinion, and believe that Roboam derogated from the law, (Deut. 21:16. C.) as David had done, unless it was left to the option of the king to appoint whom he pleased for his successor. H.—*Meant.* Prot. supply, “*he thought*” which is found in the Sept.  
**23** *Because.* Sept. “And he was magnified above.… and he gave them (cities, αυταις) abundance,” &c. This may be all understood of Abia. But Heb. rather speaks of his father: “And he acted wisely, and dispersed all his *other* children, throughout the countries of Juda;” ( H.) keeping them at a distance, to prevent any commotion, ( C.) but making ample provision and procuring wives for them, perhaps at no small cost, as few might wish to be thus prisoners at large. T.—It was probably then the custom to educate the royal children in the noblest families. See 4 K. 10:1. C.—This would also tend to increase their father’s influence, and to make them better acquainted with the country, that they might be able to communicate all necessary intelligence. H.—Pagnin and Vatable insinuate, that Roboam “caused to be educated and dispersed some of all his children, throughout all the lands of Juda.” M.

## Chapter 12

**1** *Israel*, in his dominions. The kingdom of Jeroboam had long before apostatized, though there were still many true servants of God, who would not bend the knee before Baal, v. 12. H.  
**3** *Troglodites*, who dwell in caverns, near the Red Sea. Pliny (v. 8. and vi. 29.) speaks of the city Suca, which in Heb. means a tent, as here we read *succiyim*, ( H.) “dwelling in tents;” which some explain of the Arabs, who are called *Scenites*, on the same account. T.—People of this description, without any fixed abode, inhabited the Stony as well as the Desert Arabia. C. 14:14.  
**7** *A little help.* I will not suffer them to be quite destroyed. Heb. also signifies, “shortly.” C.—*Fall*, (*stillabit*) like drops of water, even to the last. H.—How soon is God appeased! T.—Even when he punishes, he does not let the whole flood of his indignation fall upon the guilty. M.  
**10** *Bearers.* Heb. “runners,” as the guards attended the king on foot.  
**12** *For even.* Prot. “and also in Judah things went well;” ( H.) or, “he spoke good words even to Juda.” C.—Sept. “for even in Juda there were good words, and in all pleasing.” *Words* are often put for *works.* H.—The Lord regarded the fidelity of some, and the humility of the princes. ( C.—This advantage was derived from tribulation, that the king entered into himself, at least for a time: ( H.) but he was not constant, v. 14. After the scourge was withdrawn, he presently relapsed. He had betrayed great cowardice, as even his son confessed; and had probably been treated with great indignity, ( T.) as it was the custom with Sesac, or Sesostris, to chain the conquered princes to his triumphal car, and to leave obscene representations of women in the country. Joseph. viii. 4. Herod. ii.—Sesostris proceeded to the conquest of Asia. T.  
**14** *Lord*, with sincerity, being actuated only by a servile fear. He died impenitent. C.  
**15** *And diligently.* Heb. “in their genealogical accounts.” H. See C. 13:22.

## Chapter 13

**2** *Michaia*, alias Maacha. Her father had also two names; viz. Absalom or Abessalom, and Uriel. Ch.—Many had two names. T.—*Of Gabaa*, may refer to the women.  
**3** *War.* The author of the new edition of S. Jerom mentions two MSS. and there are several printed editions, which reduce these numbers to one half. Castalio adopts this correction, asserting that the Greek and Josephus are on his side, which is not true. C.—We must however observe, that there is some doubt with respect to Josephus, ( H.) as some of the oldest Latin editions acknowledge the smaller numbers; and Vignoles (i. 29.) conjectures, that the Greek copies did the same formerly, since Aborbanel “accuses Josephus of having made Jeroboam’s loss no more than 50,000, contrary to the Hebrew text,” v. 17. This learned author is of opinion, that the Jews sometimes expressed their numbers by figures, (Kennic.) analogous to those which the later Arabs borrowed from the Indians; though, in more ancient times, the letters of the alphabet had been used. Both customs seem to have prevailed; (Erpenius) and this may account for many variations, as the omission of a single cypher, resembling our period (.), might easily occasion much confusion. Kennicott (Diss. i. and ii.) seems to suspect, that the ancient versions have been made to agree with the corrupted Heb. no less than Josephus; and that many of the large numbers, recorded in Scripture, (which might countenance what we here read) are incorrect. See C. 17:13. 19 and 14:8. comp. with 16:1 and 25:6. comp. with 4 K. 13:7. It is certain ( H.) many Latin MSS. confirm the edition of Sixtus V. which has the smaller numbers; and this is the case with most of the older MSS. and editions. How S. Jerom expressed it, we cannot easily determine. The editor of his works has been guided chiefly by the Memmian canon. See 2 K. 15:7. Lyran quotes S. Jerom, as reading 50,000; (v. 7) and it is so expressed in the Paris editions of 1534 and ( H.) 1546, of the Heb. questions on Paral. But Erasmus doubts whether this be the genuine work of S. Jerom, (Ken.) or in the state in which he left it. If we consult the more ancient MSS. and editions, prior to that of Clement VIII. we shall allow that they are more favourable to the smaller numbers, on this occasion; and are more likely to exhibit the pure version of the holy doctor, ( H.) as the later editions have had “the Heb. fountains” also in view. Kennicott—If however we adhere to the received numbers, ( H.) we must remember that kings, at that time, led forth to battle all their subjects who were able to bear arms. Under Moses there were 600,000. David found 1,100,000 in Israel, and 470,000 in Juda, exclusive of Levi and Benjamin; (C. 21:5) or, at least, as it is expressed 2 K. 24:9 in all, 1,300,000. Asa was at the head of 580,000. C. 14:8. &c.  
**4** *Semeron*, on which Samaria was afterwards built. Heb. reads, “Mount Tsemaraim.” There was a city of this name in Benjamin. C.—But this was a *mount.* Heb. “in Mount Ephraim.” H.  
**5** *A covenant of salt.* That is, a firm and perpetual covenant. See Num. 18:19. Ch. W.—It seems this covenant was to be inviolable; and it had its effect, notwithstanding the crimes of many of the kings. The Arabs still regard the partaking of bread and salt as the most sacred covenant. C.—“The ancients prayed when they placed salt before their guests, that, as salt partook of two natures, so they might be cemented together in concord.” Tzetzez on Lycoph. H.—Abia speaks with much prudence, and with an air of piety, though his heart was corrupt. 3 K. 15:3. That of his adversary was still more so; and God granted victory to the former, to reward even the appearance of virtue in the king, and the sincere piety of some of his followers.  
**7** *Vain.* The saem term is used as in Matt. 5:22. C.—*Rekim*, “stupid men.” H.—Sept. “pestiferous.” Syr. “impious.”—*Heart.* Prot. “young and tender-hearted.” H.—But Roboam was not very young; (3 K. 14:21) and we may adhere to the Vulg. C.—Sept. “he was a youth, and timid.” H.—Abia speaks of his father with little respect, and seems to have forgotten that he had laid down his arms in obedience to God’s order. C.  
**8** *A* *nd golden.* These idols will enervate and render your great numbers useless. H.—We have a just cause and religion is on our side. C.  
**9** *Rams.* These were sacrificed by the false priests, who acted in a very different manner from those of the Lord. Lev. 8 and 9. C.  
**11** *Table.* It is hence inferred, that Sesac had only left one: (Lyran. Torniel.) but this does not follow. C. Salien.  
**14** *Trumpets*, to invoke God’s aid. Num. 10:9. M.  
**15** *Terrified.* Sept. “struck;” God caused the victory to declare in favour of those who were only half the number. H.  
**17** *Five.* Some Latin editions have 50,000, ( C.) which number is found in some MSS. of Epiphanius. Hudson’s Josephus.—Hentenius has the same, and only remarks five MSS. which had the greater number. See v. 3. H.—We do not read of such a slaughter in any one battle. But Israel made no resistance, and God assisted the four hundred thousand. M.—*Valiant.* Prot. “chosen.” See C. 14:13. H.—So many were either slain or wounded. D.—Prot. intimate all were “slain.” H.  
**19** *Bethel*, the head of the calf worship; though Abulensis thinks it was another city, otherwise it would not have been spared. The calf continued there till the reign of Jehu. 4 K. 10:29. M.—*Jesana;* perhaps Senna, (Num. 34:4. C.) seven miles north of Jericho. Eus.—The versions read differently.—*Ephron.* The Masorets have Ephraim. C.—Prot. “Ephraim, with the towns thereof.” H.—Josue (15:9) places Mount Ephron between Juda and Ephraim; and we find a town of the name, (1 Mac. 5:46) but on the other side of the Jordan.  
**20** *Him.* Some think Abia, as Jeroboam survived him two years: but others, ( C.) with greater probability, ( D.) suppose that the latter is here specified, and that he fell a victim to the divine wrath, as the prophet Ahias had foretold. C.—Salien, A. 3081.  
**22** *Works.* Prot. “sayings *are* written in the story of the prophets Iddo.” H.—*Modross* properly means “researches,” and was the title of the genealogical work of this prophet, from which this account is probably taken. C. 12:15. C.—The entire work is not extant. M.

## Chapter 14

**1** *Years*, dating from the fifth; as in the fifteenth year of his reign, Asa offered many victims, which had been taken from the enemy. C. 15:10. C.  
**2** *God*, with respect to the external worship of the true God, ( H.) though he had some faults. 3 K. 15:14.—*Places*, while he tolerated those which were intended for the service of the Lord, ( C.) though illegally; and he even left the buildings erected by Solomon standing, (4 K. 23:13. T.) thinking they might be no longer dangerous. Salien.—Several other pious kings did the like, for which they deserved some reprehension; as they could not be ignorant, that this was considered as wrong by the more enlightened. Eccli. 49:5. T.—It was the king’s duty to destroy the exterior practices of idolatry, while the priests and prophets were to instruct. W.  
**5** *Altars.* Heb. “high places, and the Chamanim,” or temple of the sun. Lev. 26:30. C.—Prot. “images.” H.—Asa was encouraged to perfect the work which he had begun, by the exhortation of Azarias. C. 15:8. C.  
**6** *Time*, as yet. T.—Admirable lesson for all to prepare for war in time of *quite!* H.  
**9** *Ethiopian.* Some think Zara was a successor of Sesac; and the Rabbins say, that he “restored the spoils which the latter had taken.” Seder. xvi.—He at least, made the Jews some compensation for that loss. Perhaps he had been present in the expedition of Sesac, and was now animated with the same ambition. T.—It would be difficult for a foreign king to traverse Egypt with so large an army, ( C.) unless he had conquered or intimidated the king of the country. H.—Hence some believe that the Ethiopia here in question, was a part of Arabia. C. Torniel.—But it is more probable that it lay south of Egypt, as the troops of Zara are joined with the Lybians. C. 16:8. Salien, A. 3094. T.—A king of Arabia would hardly have had so many subjects. C.—*Three.* Some would read thirteen, as Anai takes notice of the great number of chariots. C. 16:8. Jun. Malvenda. C.—But surely the number here specified is sufficient. The minds of men are very different. In the former chapter we find them complaining of the too great numbers! H.  
**10** *Meet him*, fearing lest he should lay waste his dominions, as Sesac had done. M.—*Sephata*, or Sephala, a great valley to the west of Maresa, ( C.) which is a city of Juda. M.—Sept. have, “in the vale north of Maresa.” H.  
**11** *Help* *.* Heb. “to help; whether with many, or with those who have no power.” The same sentiment was expressed by Jonathas. 1 K. 14:6. Those who have God with them are secure of victory. C.—*If God be with us,* *who is against us?*  
**12** *Terrified.* Heb. and Sept. “struck,” as he had done Jeroboam. C. 13:15. H.  
**13** *Gerara* was on the southern borders, twenty-three miles from Maresa. Eus. C.—The Ethiopians were pursued perhaps for many days. T.—*Destruction.* Prot. “they they could not recover themselves.” Heb. “there was no quarter given;” or, “so that none were left alive.” C.—If this were the case, the number of the slain far exceeded that the Jeroboam’s army. C. 13. H.  
**14** *Gerara.* The adjacent territory is now uncultivated. Jos. 13:3.—*Great.* Heb. “a fear of the Lord;” (v. 12) an extraordinary ( C.) panic. H.—The Philistines had assisted the enemy, and therefore their cities were invaded; ( M.) or these belonged to Zara. C.  
**15** *Destroyed.* Heb. “smote also the tents of cattle.” Sept. “they cut in pieces the tents of cattle, the Amazons;” or, according to the Vat. copy, ( H.) “the Alimazonians,” as they seem to have read *aeli mánim*, which may be well rendered, “the tents of the Mineans,” a people of Arabia. C. 20:1 and 26:7 and Judg. 10:11. C.—If these nations came to punish Asa, for banishing their *foreign worship*, (v. 12) as the Sieur de Folard thinks the sacred penman insinuates, (v. 5) we need not wonder that they met with such ill success, and that not one of them was spared, as God avenged his own cause, v. 12. 13. H.—We read of no cavalry here, though it is mentioned, C. 16:8. It seems not to have been considerable, as the people of Asia, the Greeks and Romans, trusted more to their infantry; and, in effect, no species of warfare is more costly to a state, nor less useful, than a multitude of horses, which were introduced in barbarous times. De Folard.

## Chapter 15

**1** *Azarias* is called Oded in Heb. 5:8. C.—But he was his *son.* H.—There was a high priest of the name of Azarias, about the same time. M.  
**2** *With him.* He will continue thus to protect you, if you prove faithful. The Pelagians hence inferred, that man was to prepare his own heart for the reception of grace. But the text only speaks of external aid; and though it were understood of internal grace, ( C.) we may merit an increase of grace, by a faithful co-operation ( W.) with that which God has presented us. E. C.  
**3** *Shall pass*, is not found in Heb. &c. and many supply, “had been.” D.—The Jews, and some interpreters, would explain all this of what had passed already; ( C.) and this is the idea of the Prot. “Now, for a long season, Israel *hath been* without,” &c. H.—But the conclusion convinces us that this is a prediction; (v. 7) *take courage.* You shall not be involved in these miseries. Some explain the whole of the kingdom of *Israel*, which, from its commencement till after its final ruin, persevered in its rebellion against the true God. Sanctius.—Others think the kingdom of Juda was also concerned, and its state of captivity at Babylon foretold. Lyran.—But its full completion includes the latter ages, particularly after the murder of the Messias, ( T.) and seems of the same nature as the prophecy of Osee, (3:4) as our Saviour himself insinuates. Mat. 24:6. 9. 13. C.  
**4** *And when.* Sept. “and he shall convert them to the Lord, … and shall be found by them.” H.—This will be verified in the last days. Rom. 11:26. M.  
**5** *Cometh in*, in public or private transactions. See Lev. 26:36.  
**6** *Nation*, both in the times of Baasa, who fought against Asa, and afterwards. For the same prophecy may be literally explained of more thing than one. M.—*Distress.* Our Saviour says, *Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted*, &c. *But he that shall persevere to the end, shall be saved.*  
**8** *Azarias, the son*, is omitted in Heb. and the Vat. Sept. which reads Adad, ( H.) but it is supplied in the other editions, and in the Syriac, ( C.) as v. 1. H.—*Taken:* we do not read on what occasion. C. 17:2. His father had seized upon Bethel, &c. C. 13:19. C.—Yet Asa waged war himself with the king of Israel.—*Dedicated.* Sept. “renewed,” as the altar had been neglected, or injured by the continual fire; ( M.) or this was the extraordinary ( H.) altar, which Solomon had used at the dedication of the temple. The multitude of Asa’s victims required more than one, v. 11. It is not probable that God’s worship had been neglected till the 15th year of this pious king, (v. 9) since even his wicked father was punctual in this respect. C. 13:11. *Before*, at the higher end of the priests’ court, to the east of the altar of holocausts. C.  
**9** *Simeon.* This tribe was intimately connected with that of Juda, though many had revolted. Some afterwards returned, as they did from other parts, actuated either by motives of interest or of religion. C. 34:6. 3 K. 11:13. C.  
**10** *Month*, Sivan, or May, when the feast of Pentecost occurs. M.  
**11** *Spoils*, which they had sold, and now testified their gratitude. T.—*Rams.* Prot. “sheep.”  
**12** *He went.* Heb. and Sept. “They proceeded, according to the covenant, to seek.” H.—They swore upon the altar, or passed between the divided victims. Gen. 15:9. 17. C.—This solemn act was *usual*, and more necessary in times of trouble. M.  
**13** *Said he*, is not in Heb. &c. H.—*Die*, according to Deut. 17:7.  
**15** *Curse.* Heb. “oath.” M.—Sept. “all Juda rejoiced on account of the oath.” H.  
**16** *Mother*, or grandmother. C.—There were perhaps two of the name, and Abia had married one as well as Roboam. M.—*Deposed*, &c. Heb. “from *being* queen.” Sept. “he removed Maacha, … that she should not minister to Astarte; and he cut the idol in pieces, and burnt it,” &c. H.—Syr. “because she had celebrated a feast to idols.” But it seems she had set up a stone, which Asa burnt. See 3 K. 15:13. C.—*Priapus* is added by the Vulg. to explain Heb. “the idol of, *or* in the grove,” ( H.) Asera or Astarte. C.  
**17** *Israel*, to the honour only of the true God. C. 14:2 and 3 K. 15:14. H.—*Perfect*, with respect to the external worship, ( T.) or hitherto, ( H.) though he offended afterwards. C. 16:7. 12. T.—Other altars, besides that at Jerusalem, might be dispensed with, ( W.) by God’s authority. H.  
**18** *Vowed*, in the wars against Jeroboam and Zara. See 1 Par. 26:27.  
**19** *Year.* Usher dates from the separation of the two kingdoms; and this year corresponds with the 15th of Asa, v. 10. See 3 K. 15:16. C. Torniel, A. 3094.

## Chapter 16

**1** *Six and thirtieth year of his kingdom.* That is, of the kingdom of Juda, taking the date of it from the beginning of the reign of Roboam. Ch.—It was the 16th of Asa. We read that Raasa died in the 26th year of Asa. 3 K. 16:8. How then could he fight with him in the 36th? T.—*Rama* was on an eminence, and commanded the pass below. Baasa wished to cut off all communication with the kingdom of Juda, as he knew many of his subjects had emigrated for the sake of the true religion. C. 15:9. C.—He had taken the city from the tribe of Benjamin. T.  
**3** *There is*, Heb. is indeterminate: “a league,” &c. Sept. “Make a league.… behold I have sent thee gold and silver. Come and drive away from me Baasa, king,” &c.—*That.* Prot. “go, break thy league.” H.—Asa induces the king of Damascus to act perfidiously. C.—Otherwise it is not unlawful to make use of the arms of infidels, unless where God has forbidden it. Grot. Jur. ii. 15. 9. Masius in Jos. ix. 15.—David had recourse to Achis, and the Machabees to the Romans. C.—Some kings are blamed for making leagues with the princes of Israel, because they had been warned to the contrary; and Asa was severely reprehended, as he had already received such assurances of the divine protection, (C. 14:12 and 15:7) that nothing but pusillanimity could have induced him ( H.) to give away the sacred treasures, in order to obtain this aid of the Syrian king, v. 7.  
**4** *Nephthali.* This seem preferable to the Heb. reading, 3 K. 15:20. C.—Prot. “all the store-cities.” Sept. “all the environs.” H.—Arab. “all the arsenals of the cities of Nephthali.”  
**7** *Syria.* It seems more natural to read Israel. C.—But we must remember that Benadad was an ally of Israel; and if he had not been bribed, he would have come to the assistance of Baasa, ( H.) and thus both might have fallen a prey to Asa, as the much greater forces of Zara had done. T.  
**9** *Behold.* Prot. “run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of *them* whose heart *is* perfect towards him.” Sept. “to shew power in every heart full, *or* perfect, in his regard.” H.—Asa fell on this occasion through human frailty, but rose again by repentance.—*Thee*, as they were till the death of Baasa. 3 K. 15:32.  
**10** *Prison.* Lit. “in bonds,” (*nervum*) made of leather thongs or nerves, ( H.) or of iron, to confine either the neck or the feet. Isidor. orig. 5. ult.—Heb. “the house of disturbance.” Sept. &c. “prison.” Some explain it ( C.) of the stocks to enclose the neck. Vatable.—*Time*, either because they expressed the same sentiments as the prophet, ( C.) or because they disapproved of his imprisonment. T.—Sept. “Asa made havoc among the people,” &c. H.  
**12** *Most*, &c. Heb. “till his disease got upwards,” ( C.) to the head ( T.) and heart, ( H.) when the gout generally proves fatal. A. Lapide—Sept. “till he was very ill:” ( H.) a just punishment for his having confined the prophet in fetters; but of a temporal nature, as he sinned through passion, and died penitent, his heart being perfect (C. 15:17) *all* or the most part of *his days*, particularly in the last. W.—*Rather.* Heb. and Sept. simply, “physicians.” H.—Yet it was not the having recourse to them, with some degree of confidence, that is here reprehended, but the placing too much trust in men, ( C.) and too little in God, the sovereign arbiter of life and death. H.  
**14** *Sepulchre.* Heb. “sepulchres,” as there were many separate apartments in the same cavern. C.—Asa had prepared one cell, as David and Solomon had done. M. T.—*Odoriferous* (*mertriciis.*) Such as harlots delight in, (Prov. 7:16,) to entice the sensual. D.—Heb. zenim, may be derived from *zana, fornicari* *.* It denotes a mixture of perfumes. M.—But here the Vulg. read *zunim* *.* D.—Heb. and Sept. “they laid him on a bed, and filled it with aromatical spices, and with various sorts of perfumers’ ointments, and they made him a very great funeral, *or* ( H.) burning.” Prot.—It is not clear whether the body was placed on a bed of state, and these perfumes were used to remove every disagreeable smell, or the body itself was rather consumed along with them, a practice which seems to have become more common since the days of Asa. Jer. 34:5. 1 K. 31:12. Amos 6:10. Joram was deprived of this honour. C. 21:19. C.—Sanctius adduces many examples, to prove that the spices were burnt only near the body; ( T.) and the Hebrews generally preferred to inter the corpse. *Corpora condere quam cremare è more Ægyptio* *.* Tacit. Hist. v.

## Chapter 17

**1** *Israel.* In consequence of the civil broils, which ensued after the death of Baasa. The two kingdoms had been nearly equal.  
**2** *Numbers*, who were kept on foot; probably as in the days of David.  
**3** *First.* Before his fall: some copies add, “and last,” (La Haye) as the Gothic MS. used by Mariana does, agreeably to the Scripture style. D.—David began and ended well. H.  
**5** *Presents*, as was customary, (1 K. 10:27,) or tribute. C.  
**6** *When.* Heb. “And his heart was elevated in the ways of the Lord.” He was endued with courage to undertake the great work of banishing all abuses out of his dominions, seeing that the people were well affected, and the Lord urged him forward. H.—He trusted no so much to his great army or riches, as to a good conscience, ( T.) which made him fear no difficulties; (1 Jo. 3:21,) doubting not but God would grant him success, as he endeavoured to keep his laws. C.—*Groves* of idols, ( M.) though he tolerated the high places, which had been consecrated to God. C. 20:33 and 3 K. 22:43. H.—Good works, rewarded by God, encouraged people to proceed in virtue. W.  
**7** *Princes.* Political, ( T.) to see that all paid attention to the proper teachers; (Mal. 2:7. C.) and thus to partake in that good work. M.—The princes might also give instruction by word ( C.) and example. H.  
**9** *Book.* The Pentateuch, or its abridgment, the book of Deuteronomy, ( M.) which they read and explained. C.—*People.* It was not sufficient to destroy idolatry, ( M.) unless the people were taught how to serve the true God. H.  
**10** *War.* They had witnessed the fruitless attempt of Zara. C. 14:15. H.  
**11** *Philistines.* Though they had been reduced by David, they had sometimes proved remiss in the payment of tribute.—*Arabians*, who lived near the Ethiopians, and the Dead Sea. C. 21:19. They had been subdued by Solomon, (3 K. 10:15) and were rich in cattle. Ezec. 27:21. The name is not so comprehensive as we generally make it. C.  
**12** *Hous* *es.* Prot. “castles.” Heb. biraniyoth. Birah is properly a Chal. word, and is added after *susan*, to imply that it was a royal castle, ( C.) or palace. ( H.) 2 Esd. 1:1.—Sept. often use *baris* in the same sense. C.—It became a provincial word in Palestine, for a place shut up on all sides and built like a tower. S. Jer. ad Princep.—David calls the temple a palace (habbirah) for God. 1 Par. 29:1. C.—Josaphat employed his immense riches in beautifying the country, and erecting storehouses, v. 5.—*Walled.* Prot. “cities of store.” H. See C. 15:4.  
**14** *Ednas* was the chief of the five generals, who had under their command 1,160,000, ( C.) besides the garrison soldiers, v. 19. H.—So great power and riches had not been seen in Juda since the days of Solomon. C.—They were not all on duty at the same time, but were able to bear arms ( M.) when called out.  
**16** *Consecrated.* Heb. “a volunteer of the Lord,” ( H.) serving at his own expence, ( T.) or with remarkable zeal. C.—Perhaps he was of the tribe of Levi, ( M.) or had taken the vows of the Nazarites, &c.  
**17** *After.* Heb. and Sept. “And of Benjamin, Eliada, a valiant man of the army.” H.—It seems all were not chosen from Juda. M.  
**19** *King*, at different times. Sept. “waiting upon” him, ( H.) like the companies which David had appointed, ( C.) but far more numerous. H.—The dominions of Juda were now pretty extensive, and well cultivated. The population must have amounted to near six millions, for whose support recourse must have been had to commerce. Rome had once almost four million inhabitants, and Cairo is said to contain seven millions, while China has two hundred millions. C.—We must reflect that many from the other tribes had taken refuge in the kingdom of Juda. T.—It would be too bold to suppose, with Kennicott, that so many numbers have been corrupted. H. C. 13:3.

## Chapter 18

**1** *Affinity*, taking Achab’s daughter for his son’s wife. T. C. 21:6. 3 K. 22.  
**3** *War.* Josaphat was too complaisant. He was rebuked by the son of Hanani, as Asa had been by his father; (C. 16:7) and, not long after, Eliezer reproached him for joining in alliance with Ochozias,. C. 20. C.—He acted without an ill intention, and was more easily pardoned. W.  
**14** *Hands.* He ironically ( C.) alludes to the declarations of the false prophets. H.  
**18** *Ye.* In 3 K. he addresses his discourse chiefly to Achab. C.  
**20** *Said.* See 3 K. 22. The Rabbins pretend that the *spirit* of Naboth *came forth.* But it was satan, or an evil spirit. T.  
**21** *So.* The Lord permits evil, but he does not approve of it. C.—Homer makes Jupiter send a deluding dream to Agamemnon. Iliad B.—The delusive predictions of impostors, are one great source of calamities. D.  
**25** *Amelech.* Sept. and Syr. “to Joas, the commander, son of the father. H.—He had perhaps the government of affairs at Samaria, during his king.” Achab’s absence. T.  
**27** *People.* Mark what I say. The event will quickly prove whether I am a prophet or an impostor. H.  
**29** *Dress.* Prot. “disguised himself, and they went.” See 3 K. 22:30.  
**31** *Turned.* Heb. “moved them from him.” They felt that he was under God’s protection; and discovered that he was not the king of Israel. H.

## Chapter 19

**2** *Thou.* Sept. “O king Josaphat, if thou helpest the sinner; *or*, wilt thou befriend one hated by the Lord?” Prot. “shouldst thou.… love them that hate the Lord?” H.—The Donatists hence inferred, that it was not lawful to converse with sinners. But S. Aug. (c. ep. Par. 2:18) replied, that Josaphat was blamed for aiding Achab in the contempt of the true prophet, and for going to battle conformably to the predictions of impostors. Both kings offended, but in a different degree. W.—We must also keep at as great a distance as possible from the notorious enemies of God, as their conversation is dangerous. T.—Evil communications corrupt the best of manners. See Ps. 138. &c.  
**3** *Works.* Sept. “words.” Prot. “things.” H.—The merit of Josaphat screened him from punishment. T.—*Prepared.* Sept. “directed.” M.—Syr. “disposed.” Faith teaches that we can do no good of ourselves, but that we have free will to choose either good or evil.  
**4** *Ephraim.* This was the northern boundary, as Dan or Emath had been under David and Solomon. C.  
**6** *And whatsoever.* Heb. “who *is* with you in the judgment.” The Lord will confirm you just decisions, and punish your injustice. H.—God stood in the synagogue of gods, *or* judges. Ps. 81:1. Judges ought not so much to regard man as God, when they pass sentence. C.—How then will the Anabaptists deny that a man may sit in judgment?  
**7** *Gifts.* The contrary is the source of so much corruption. H.—It would be proper to inscribe this sentence on the walls of all courts of judicature, or rather on the hearts of all in office. T.—None but the true religion can produce such maxims. C.  
**8** *And the.* Heb. “of the Lord, and for disputes *among the people among themselves*, ( H.) and they returned, (v. 4) *or* dwelt at Jerusalem.” C.—Sept. “to judge the inhabitants of,” &c. Josephus (ix. 1.) says, “he returned.” Syr. “And being returned.… he exhorted.”  
**10** *Cities.* He addressed the judges of the capital, to whom appeals might be made. C. M.—*Kindred*, with respect to inheritances and matrimonial cases. Heb. “blood,” or murder, whither casual or wilful.  
**11** *Amarias*, (1 Par. 6:11) or rather Azarias, the father of Johanan. ib. v. 9.—*Office*, in civil matters. C.—Here is a plain distinction between the spiritual and temporal authority, instituted by God. Deut. 17. Num. 27. W. T.—*Masters.* Heb. shoterim, to execute the sentence; ( D.) or “officers.”—*You.* Prot. “with the good.” H.

## Chapter 20

**1** *Of the Ammonites;* people sprung from them. Those who explain the Psalm 82 of this war, find many nations mentioned. Some of these, not daring to appear openly, assumed the name of Ammonites. Perhaps we should read ( C.) *Mannim.* H.—Sept. “the Mineans,” who dwelt in Arabia Felix, upon the Red Sea, (Pliny vi. 28.) or rather the Maonians, in the environs of Gaza. C.—Some MSS. and Latin editions have “Idumeans,” which is conformable to v. 11, 23, and S. Jerom Trad. Lyran, &c. M.  
**2** *Sea* of Sodom, ( H.) or the Red Sea. D.—*Syria*, which comprised the country of Ammon. M.—Perhaps Edom might rather have been in the text, as we find no Syrians in this war, but many of the Idumeans. C.—*Adom* and *Arom*, (Syria. H.) have often been confounded. 4 K. 16:6. C.—*Asasonthamar*, “the palm-tree cottage,” (Bochart) between Jericho and the Dead Sea.  
**3** *Juda.* The whole kingdom was concerned. Sometimes a fast was proclaimed for one city. 3 K. 21:9. Jonas 3:7. C.—They were accustomed to fast, not only to subdue the flesh, but also for other necessities. W.  
**4** Prot. “to ask *help* of.” H.—*Cities.* Here we have an example of a pilgrimage to a holy place, as God is more willing to hear the virtuous in one place than in another. C. 6:7. &c. W.  
**5** *New court* of the priests. Why it is so called, does not appear. C.—Some understand the court for the women; (Salien) others, that for Gentiles. Le Clerc.—Probably some of the courts had been found too spacious after the schism, and had been neglected; but now, as many had returned to serve the Lord in the dominions of Josaphat, he had made some repairs. T.  
**7** *All*, or the greatest part. Heb. “drive out the inhabitants.” H.  
**9** *Sword of.* Prot. “*as* the sword, judgment, or,” &c. Sept. “the sword, judgment, death, famine.” All these are sent in punishment of sin. H.—The sword of the enemy is a judgment of God. M.  
**12** *Judge* and punish *them*, as they fight against thee? C.—*Enough.* Yet we read that Josaphat had above a million soldiers; and he knew that his father had discomfited a greater army of Zara with half the forces. He thus puts us in mind that no power can stand against God’s will; and he endeavours, by humility, to obtain the protection of heaven. The invading army must, however, have been very numerous, to extort these expressions from a potent king, and to have thrown his whole people into such consternation. It could hardly be less than that of Zara; and thus, in the space of a century, above two millions and a half of idolaters perished by the hand of God, without Juda losing a single man, v. 29. C. 13:17. H.  
**13** *Children.* Even the little infants were deprived of the breasts, on such emergencies, that their cries might be more affecting. H. Joel 2:16. Judit. 4:8.—The pagans of Ninive even made the cattle also fast. Jonas 3:7. C. S. Amb. ser. 40. T.  
**14** *Spirit* of prophecy. M.—Jahaziel is known only by this event. C.  
**16** *Six.* Some translate “flowry ascent.” C.—Prot. “the cliff of Ziz.” H.—If it had been Zin, we might understand the desert of stony Arabia, where Ptolemy places the town of Ziza. C.—But we may recollect that the army was already advanced as far as Engaddi; (v. 2,) so that it seems to have lain nearer Jerusalem. H.—*Jeruel*, “the fear of God,” which name was given to the place, in consequence of the panic with which God struck the enemy. S. Jerom. M.  
**19** *High.* Rejoicing at the promised deliverance. C.  
**20** *Thecua*, two mile east of Bethlehem, on the road to Jeruel. Adric. M.—*Believe.* Faith is the foundation of all good works; (Heb. 11) but not alone sufficient, as here the people fasted and prayed, and would have fought, if God had not dispensed with them. See Jos. 23. W.—We may also translate Heb. “trust.”  
**21** *Ever.* This was usually sung in times of joy. C. 5:13. The army seemed thus to be returning victorious. C.  
**22** *Ambushments*, placed by the Moabites, ( M.) and Ammonites, ( H.) against Juda. Some detachments of Mount Seir, perhaps, coming suddenly on them, were taken for foes, and slaughtered. H.  
**24** *Tower.* Maspha, in the tribe of Benjamin, ( C.) or some other ( H.) eminence. M.  
**25** Insomuch*.* Heb. and Sept. “Three days passed, while they gathered the spoils, because it was great,” ( H.) “without weight,” or estimation. C.  
**26** *Blessing.* SS. Jerom and Epiphanius place Caphar-barucha, “the field of blessing,” near Hebron, on the east. Hither Abraham attended the Lord, when he was going to destroy Sodom. Epist. Paulæ.  
**29** *Lands*, in the vicinity. M.—*Israel*, as he had lately treated Zara. C. 14:13. H.  
**33** *Places*, erected in honour of God, but displeasing to him. C. 17:6. H.—The good king perhaps attempted to take these also away, but was obliged to desist by the rebellious people. M.—Hence we find that they are here blamed. H.—They would not conform exactly to the law, (Lev. 17:3. T.) and the king was not able to bring all to perfection. W.—“It is better to pass over.… vices, than to shew which we cannot subdue.” Tacit. An. iii.  
**34** *Which.* Sept. “who wrote a book of the kings of Israel.” H.—Jehu rebuked Josaphat, C. 19. C.—His book is not extant. M.  
**35** *Things:* the victory over Ammon, &c. H.—*Wicked.* See C. 16:3.  
**36** Tharsis*;* probably Cilicia, ( C.) or some part of the ocean.—*Asion-gaber* was on the Red Sea; and ships would not have been built there, to trade on the Mediterranean. C. 9:21. T.

## Chapter 21

**2** *Azarias.* The only difference between this and the former name is, that the younger brother’s ( H.) has *u* at the end, ( C.) *Azrieu.* Prot. and Sept. make no difference, which we should nevertheless expect. H.—*Juda.* Heb. “Israel.” Sept. Syr. &c. agree with the Vulg. editions, though most of the ancient Latin MSS. have Israel. Josephat ruled over the principal tribes. Yet it seems probable, from the versions, that the Heb. formerly read Juda.  
**3** *Pensions.* Heb. “precious things.” Sept. “arms.”  
**4** *Sword.* This cruel policy ( H.) has been very common in the East. C.—*I* *srael.* They had perhaps opposed his impious plans, animated by his brethren. God presently chastised him with the rebellion of Idumea; and though Joram gained a victory over Seir, (4 K. 8:21) he was not able to reduce the nation, being called off by other wars, v. 16. His own subjects at Lobna, a Levitical city in Juda, also abandoned him. Dreadful evils were denounced in a letter from the prophet Elias, who had been translated to paradise nine years before, and at last the honours of sepulture were denied to the wicked king. T.  
**6** *Achab.* It is supposed by Jezabel. She might be grand-daughter of Amri. C. 22:2. The infamous Athalia is blamed for most of the evils which her husband committed.  
**7** *Lamp;* heir and successor. C. Ps. 131:17.  
**10** *Day*, when the author lived. See 4 K. 8:20.  
**11** *Fornication;* idolatry. M.—Heb. “and compelled Juda.” Sept. “seduced.” Syr. “dissipated Juda.” C.—He used every art of seduction and violence to introduce idolatry, to the ruin of his kingdom. H.  
**12** *Elias.* Le Clerc would read Eliseus. Grotius supposes that all passed in a dream. Others think that Elias had written *the letter* before his removal from the conversation of men, some years before, foreseeing the impiety of Joram, and leaving the letter with Eliseus, to be delivered unto him. M. Jun.—But the most common opinion is, that the prophet wrote it in paradise, ( C.) and sent it to the king by an angel, &c. Seder. xvii. Bellarm. T.—Elias had been taken away in the 18th year of Josaphat, who reigned 25; so he shewed this special care of Joram and his kingdom, so many years after his assumption. W.—Thus the saints in heaven interest themselves in our defence. 2 Mac. 15:11. H.—*Prophet.* Heb. “And there came in him a writing of,” &c. C.  
**14** *Thee* is not expressed in Heb. but it is in the Sept. and the king was not only afflicted with illness, but with the losses of his people and family. H.  
**15** *By little.* Heb. “by reason of the sickness, ( H.) day by day,” or in two years time, v. 19. C.—He was probably ill so long. H.—Agrippa and Antiochus were treated in the same manner, ( C.) with a diarrhœa, ( M.) or dysentery, ( C.) the vitals being corrupted. Valesius 40.  
**16** *Philistines;* who, it seems, had been obedient since the days of David.—*Ethiopians*, who lay west of the Arabians, from the Red Sea to the lower Egypt and the Nile, ( C.) bordering on Madian. There was another Ethiopia to the south of Egypt. M.  
**17** *Joachaz*, alias Ochozias, ( Ch.) or Azarias, in Heb. C. 22:1 and 6. C.—The variation of names seems to originate in the mistakes of transcribers, very frequently. If we found in some profane author, that Philip had only one son, *Ander-alex*, left, and that this son, *Alex-ander*, succeeded him, we should readily allow that the first syllables had been erroneously placed last, (Kennic.) as on this occasion *aéz-ieu* stands for *ieu-aéz.* Sept. has here Οχοζιας; as the other versions have also *Ochozias*, (C. 22:6) instead of Azrieu, ( H.) a name given to Ozias, king of Juda, when it belonged to the priests, as it here belongs to one of the captains. C. 23:1. Sometimes we find *Aézie.* 4 K. 9:16. Strange inconsistency! Kennicott. See 4 K. 14:21.  
**19** *And.* Prot. “And it came to pass that, in the process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out, by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases: And his people made no burning for him,” &c. ( H.) not that the body was usually consumed, but no aromatical spices were burned near it, (Sanctius. T.) as in the funeral of Asa. C. 16:14. C.—The point is controverted.  
**20** *Rightly.* Sept. “unpraised.” Heb. “without any satisfaction;” or, “he departed unregretted,” oppressed with illness, and odious to all.—*Kings.* Joas, Achaz, Achab, and Manasses, were disgraced in like manner, after their death. The Hebrews then shewed their resentment, without fear. The like custom prevailed in Egypt, and kept many within bounds. No person could receive the usual honours of burial, if his accusers could maintain their charge against his character before a court of above forty people, assembled for the purpose. Calumny was severely punished. But the kings themselves were to stand their trial, while their corpse was placed in the porch of the monument, and the priest spoke their funeral oration. The people testified their approbation or discontent, “and many of the kings have been deprived of a glorious and legal burial, on account of the opposition of the multitude.” Diod. i. and ii. C.

## Chapter 22

**1** *Arabians* and Philistines. C. 21:17. H.  
**2** *Forty-two*, &c. Divers Greek Bibles read *twenty-two*, agreeably to 4 K. 8:18. ( Ch.) with the Syr. and Arab. The Rom. ( C.) and Alex. Sept. have “twenty.” H.—Ochozias was the youngest son, and his father died at forty years of age. C. 21:20. C.—Others would date from the birth of Amri, (Broughton) or of Athalia. But is most probable that we should read 22, as 4 K. C.—The contradiction has so much perplexed the commentators, that Walton (prol. 36) puts it among the *quædam* απορα; and De Dieu says, “I would rather plainly confess that this difficulty is to us inexplicable.” The error here, “is plainly owing to a mistake of one of the Heb. numeral letters,” *c*, being put instead of *m*, which was formerly more similar than it is now. “In Origen’s Hexapla, one of the Greek copies (probably that found in Caracalla’s time) reads here *cb*, by rendering the number 22, εικοσι και δυο, all which proofs make the mistake indubitable, and strongly recommend this method of correcting it.” Kennicott.—Mariana, T. &c. had already suggested this plan, ( H.) which is very plausible. D.—Ochozias might reign twenty years with his father, and only one alone. 4 K. 8:26. W.  
**3** *Pushed.* Heb. and Sept. “was his counsellor to,” &c.  
**6** *Ochozias.* So all the versions read. Heb. “Azarias,” is probably incorrect, unless this man had three names. C.  
**7** *For.* Prot. “and the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, by coming to Joram.” God had decreed to punish him by the hand of Jehu. 4 K. 9.  
**8** *Out.* Heb. “exercising judgment with.”—*Brethren*, who had been themselves slain by the rovers. Ochozias employed his nephews at court, and they expected that he would make some stay at Jezrahel.  
**9** *Hid in* the kingdom of *Samaria*, (Malvenda) at Mageddo, where he was wounded; though he was perhaps put to death at Jezrahel. 4 K. 9:27.—*Buried him*, at Jerusalem.—*Reign.* Heb. “the house of Ochozias had no one to bear the weight of the kingdom.” The children of the deceased were too young, particularly as most of the princes were slain. C.—Human *hope* failed, but God’s providence kept David’s issue on the throne, till Christ appeared. W.  
**10** *All*, except Joas, (v. 11, and 4 K. 11:1. C.) ninety-five years after Solomon’s death. Mariana. D.  
**11** *High* is not expressed in Heb. or Sept. but he is supposed to have been the pontiff. H.

## Chapter 23

**1** *Seventh.* Vat. Sept. by mistake, has “the eighth.”—*Encouraged*, or “strengthened.” Sept. &c. H.—*Captains*, whether Levites, or ancient officers of the crown, who were dissatisfied with the usurper. 4 K. 11.  
**2** *Israel*, of which Juda formed a part. M.—At the time when the author lived, Israel was destroyed, so that there was no danger of a mistake.—*Jerusalem*, on a sabbath-day, and most likely on one of the three great festivals: ( C.) Salien ( A. 3157) thinks at the Passover, to avoid suspicion. M.  
**4** *Do.* Though God’s promise was absolute, human means were to be used. W.  
**5** *To the sabbath.* That is, to perform in your weeks the functions of your office, or the weekly watches. Ch.—*Porters.* Sept. “even to the entrance gates.”—*House*, where Athalia resided, or in the apartments of Joas in the temple.—*Foundation.* Sept. “middle.” Syr. “of the cooks, *or* guards.” H.—It led from the palace up the steps, v. 21. M.—Perhaps it was also called *Sur*, 4 K.—*But let.* This seems to be transposed out of its place from v. 6.  
**7** *Slain.* Athalia ventured to enter; but she was alone, and not much feared. C.  
**8** *High.* Heb. “the priest dismissed not the courses.” H.—In case of right and necessity, we see here what the high priest could do, though otherwise he would not interfere. W.  
**10** *Altar* of holocausts, in the court of the priests, while the people stood in their own court. T.  
**11** *Crown.* Lit. “diadem.”—*Testimony.* This is explained in the following sentence, ( H.) which is not in Hebrew nor in many Latin MSS. The Jews understand the phylaceries. Deut. 17:18.  
**13** *Step.* Heb. hamudo, “his pillar,” to which he ascended by steps. D.—*Entrance* into the court of the priests; but the tribune stood in that of the people, where Joas was in his royal attire.  
**16** *Himself*, as God’s vicegerent. C.—A double covenant was made between God and the people, and between the king and his subjects. D.  
**17** *Idols.* Prot. “images.” H.—Those are wilfully blind who will not distinguish these from the images of Christ and his saints. W.  
**18** *David*, which had been long neglected. 1 Par. 24. M.  
**20** *Upper gate* of the guards, at the back or western end of the temple. C. 5:5.

## Chapter 24

**3** *Him.* Joas, as Prot. ( H.) and most interpreters understand it, with the Syr. &c. Joiada was too old to think of marrying again, as the Rabbins would explain the Heb. conformably to the Sept. and Arab. “himself.” C.—Joas did not probably marry two at once. Salien, A. 3766.—Amasias was born of Joadan. C. 25:1. M.—The high priest considered Joas as his son, being married to his aunt. H.  
**5** *Money.* The half sicle, (Ex. 30:13. 4 K. 12:4. C.) which at first was required for the tabernacle, and afterwards for the repairs of the temple. W.  
**6** *Chief* “priest,” (v. 11,) where he is called *the first.* Heb. “the head priest.”  
**7** *Children.* All but Ochozias had been slain by the Arabs. The plural is often put for the singular. S. Jerom (Trad.) explains it of the priests of the idols, whom Athalia cherished as her own offspring.  
**10** *That*, &c. Heb. “till it was done,” according to the law. Pagnin.  
**11** *From day.* Lit. “every day,” ( H.) when the chest was replenished. M.  
**14** *And for.* Heb. “and to offer,” such as ( H.) “mortars.” Prov. 27:22. Eali is thus translated. C.—Prot. “and spoons and vessels.”  
**16** *Israel*, particularly to those of the kingdom of Juda. H.—*His*, David’s, *house*, ( M.) as he had restored the crown to his offspring.  
**17** *Worshipped.* Heb. “bowed down to the king, and he hearkened to them.” H.—The Jews say that the princes flattered him with the title of god, as he had been educated in the temple. E.—But this is improbable. C.—They petitioned for leave to re-establish the worship of Baal, ( M.) and paid greater honours to the king than were becoming. D.  
**18** *Idols.* Heb. “sorrows.” Sept. “the Astartes and idols.” C.  
**19** *Them.* Calling heaven and earth to witness ( C.) the unity of God. H.—These prophets might have been performing their sacred commission ever since the reign of Josaphat; during which time Eliseus, Micheas, Jehu, and others, lived. C. 20:14 and 18:27. C.  
**20** *Priest*, refers to Zacharias. Sept. “Azarias.” H.—It is not certain whether this was the person whom Jesus Christ speaks, (Mat. 23:35. C.) as S. Jerom believes; (ib.) or our Saviour alludes to one of the minor prophets, ( T.) or to the father of the baptist. Baronius. H.—*Sight.* Heb. “above,” perhaps on the steps between the two courts. C.—*To make.* Heb. “therefore hath he forsaken you.”  
**22** *Require it.* I commit my cause into his hands. M.—The vengeance of the Lord was not slack. H.  
**23** *Damascus.* Hazael had before invaded Jerusalem. 4 K. 12:17. The Syrian army, which routed Juda, was comparatively small. C.—The idolatrous *princes* now received the due punishment of their crimes, v. 17.  
**24** *Shameful*, is not expressed in Heb. But the putting a king to the torture, (v. 25.) and upbraiding him with his ingratitude and perfidy, was a gread indignity. H.—He had probably entered into engagements with Hazael, when he prevailed on him to depart, the year before. C.—Nabuchodonosor treated Sedecias in like manner. 4 K. 25:6. The author of the Heb. Trad. among the works of S. Jerom, ( H.) asserts that the children of Joas were slain before his eyes, while the Syrians reproached him for the unjust murder of Zacharias. C.  
**25** *Servants.* By whom the man is slain, who had murdered his spiritual father. W.—*Son.* Heb. “sons.” See v. 7. Some think that the brothers of Zacharias were slain, that they might not attempt to revenge his death.—*Kings.* These sepulchres are amazingly beautiful and spacious. The doors are six feet high, and formed, like the rest, of solid stone, cut in the most elegant manner. Doubdan 26. C.  
**26** *Moabitess.* Sept. read, “the Ammonite.… and Moabite.” See 4 K. 12:21. H.  
**27** *And.* Sept. “And all his sons: for five came upon him,” with the rest of the conspirators. H.—They have read differently. C.—*Sum.* Heb. “the greatness of the burden on him,” ( H.) imposed by the Syrians, (v. 24) or denounced by the prophets. *Mossa* is often taken for a prophetic menace. C.—*More.* Heb. “in the researches.” Prot. “story of the book.” Addo entitled his book *Modross.* C. xxii. 22. H.—Only some extracts from these works have come down to us. Esdras had them before him. The abridgments have occasioned their loss, as has been the case with many other excellent works. This was the more easy, as writing was not then so common. C.

## Chapter 25

**2** *Heart*, and with perseverance.  
**5** *Families.* The officers were well acquainted with their soldiers; ( C.) and all were more interested for each other’s welfare, ( D.) than they are in the present system. C.—*Young.* Prot. “choice *men, able* to go.” H.  
**6** *Thousand.* Yet “they were so greatly reduced, but a few years before, that there were.… only fifty horsemen,” &c. 4 K. 13:7. Kennicott—That might be true, at one time, when the people fled from the king’s banners, through fear. But they were still in the country, and God *gave Israel a saviour.* ib. v. 5. See C. 13:3 and 17:19. H.—*Silver.* This sum was very small, for so great a multitude. Salien suspects talents of gold are meant, though the soldiers were paid in silver. But the sum was only the hire for a short time; ( M.) and was not distributed among the soldiers, who were to live on plunder, but went into the king’s coffers, ( C.) or belonged to the officers alone. Mariana. D.—The talent of silver was worth 342*l.* 3*s.* 9*d.* Arbuthnot.  
**8** *And.* Heb. “But if thou wilt go, do; be strong; (*he speaks ironically*) God,” &c. Sept. “if thou thinkest that thou art strong with these, the Lord,” &c. Amasias ought to have known that no dependance was to be placed on Israel, while they despised God. C. 15:2.  
**9** *What will.* Syr. &c. “What then is my crime in having given the,” &c.—*To the.* Heb. or, “for the army.” H.  
**12** *Rock*, afterwards called Jecteel. Some take it to be Petra. 4 K. 14:7.  
**13** *Samaria*, the capital, where they had made their complaints to king Joas; and receiving no redress, began to plunder, as far as *Bethhoron* the lower, which Solomon had repaired, and his successors had retained, though it belonged to the territory of Ephraim. C. 13:5. Jos. 18:13. C.  
**16** *Art thou.* Heb. adds, “appointed.” H.—The very character of prophet, authorized him to give counsel even to kings. Amasias had perhaps obeyed this prophet, (v. 7) but now his heart was puffed up with victory.—*Kill t* *hee*, sixteen years hence.  
**17** *Another*, and fight. He supposed Joas had connived at his subjects’ invasion, (v. 13. H. See 4 K. 14:8. C.) and he now required all Israel to submit to him. Josephus. T.  
**18** *Thistle.* This fable insinuated how much Joas despised the insolence of his antagonist, ( H.) and Amasias had soon reason to repent. T.  
**20** *It.* Prot. “it *came* of God, that he might deliver them into the hand *of their enemies*, because they sought after the gods of Edom.” H.—The king was permitted to give ear to evil counsellors. C.—“Jupiter deprives those of understanding, whom he means to destroy.” Homer—The heart is hardened on account of former sins. W.  
**24** *Obededom*, whose descendants guarded these treasures. 1 Par. 26:15. C.—*Hostages.* Prot. “the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.” H.—Some think that the kings of Juda had before detained these men. E.—Others suppose that Joas had taken many nobles, whom he exchanged for their sons. But this is all conjecture.  
**28** *David.* Heb. “of Juda,” contrary to the Sept. Syr. &c. C.

## Chapter 26

**1** *Ozias*, called Azarias (4 K. 14:21. C.) improperly. H.  
**2** *Juda*, till the reign of Achaz. 4 K. 16:6. It had revolted under Joram. C.  
**4** *Done.* And was successful, as long as he attended to the high priest. Num. 27:21. W.  
**5** *God*, or who had the gift of intelligence and prophecy from God. Heb. “who was intelligent in the visions of God.” Others have read *birath*, with the Sept. “in the fear;” or Chal. &c. “instructing in the fear of the Lord.” The Jews childishly understand Zacharias to mean the king himself, in the early part of his reign. Others suppose the priest, who was slain by Joas, is designated. Lyran.—But this was rather his son ( T. Cajet. C.) and successor, as well as a prophet, who had therefore a more perfect knowledge of God; though none can comprehend his being. H.  
**6** *In.* Prot. “about Ashdod.” Sept. “he built (or repaired) the cities of Azotus,” to keep under the Philistines, who had revolted under Joram. C. 21:16.  
**7** *Gurbaal* *.* Gerera, (S. Jer. Trad.) or Gebal. Ps. 82:8. Sept. “the rock,” or Petra, in Arabia, where Stephanus places the Gabalenes.—*Ammonites.* Heb. mehunim. Sept. “Mineans,” (C. 20:1. H.) upon the Red Sea, (Steph.) or Mediterranean, (Pliny vi. 28,) or in Arabia Felix. Strabo. M.  
**8** *Gifts.* Tribute. C. 27:5. C.—*Victories.* Prot. “the strengthened *himself* exceedingly.” H.  
**9** *Corner.* Repairing what Joas had demolished. 4 K. 14:13. T.  
**10** *Wilderness*, for the protection of shepherds. 4 K. 17:9.—*Plains.* Heb. “valleys, and in the plains husbandmen, and vinedressers in the mountains, and in Carmel; for he loved the earth, *or* husbandry,” like David. 1 Par. 17:25. &c.—*Carmel*, means, “the vine of God;” as both the mount in Juda, where Nabal resided, and that on the Mediterranean Sea, were famous for wine. Ozias probably cultivated the former mountain. C.  
**11** *Doctor.* Heb. shoter. Sept. “judge.” Prot. “ruler.” H.—The term is commonly understood of one who executes the sentence of the judge. But this employment does not suit a general, ( C.) though such a one might well command. It many denote any “officer.” H.  
**15** *Engines.* They are here mentioned for the first time. C.—*For the.* Heb. “for he was wonderfully helped till he was established.” H.—He invented may things for the defence of his kingdom. C.  
**17** *Azarias.* The prophet, who had hitherto kept the king ( H.) within bounds, was now no more, v. 5. T.  
**18** *To thee.* For usurping spiritual authority, the king was opposed by the high priest; and God confirmed the sentence of the latter, by striking Ozias with the leprosy; on which account, the was not only cast out of the temple, but also lost his kingdom, being obliged to live apart; (Lev. 13:46,) and after death, he could not be buried with his ancestors. W.  
**19** *Forehead.* So that it could not be concealed. According to the rigour of the law, such an offender was to be slain. Num. 3:10 and 18:7. The leprosy was considered as equivalent, and is styled *destr* *uction*, (v. 16,) and death. Isai. 7:1. M. See 4 K. 15:6.  
**22** *Prophet.* Yet we find little concerning him in the prophecy of Isaias; so that the work has been lost, except what Esdras hath preserved. C.  
**23** *Leper.* So much was the disease abhorred, ( C.) as well as the king’s late conduct. H.

## Chapter 27

**2** *Lord.* Like Ozias, to offer incense. He was content with the royal dignity, without arrogating to himself that of the priests. C.—*Transgressed.* Heb. “acted corruptly,” on the heights. 4 K. 15:35. H.  
**3** *Gate*, on the east, repairing ( T.) and beautifying it so, ( H.) that Jeremias (26:10,) calls it *New.* T.—*Ophel*, on the walls of the city, ( C.) towards the eastern porch of the temple. Joseph. S. Jer. in Isa. xxxii. 14.—Here the Nathineans dwelt. 2 Esd. 3:26. C.—Kimchi, &c. translate, “a citadel.” T.  
**5** *Measures*, (*coros.*) Heb. corim, also, ( H.) means an “ass;” as this burden was sufficient for one, being equivalent to 30 Romans bushels. A. Lapide. M.—*Give him.* Sept. adds, “These things did the king of Ammon bring to him every year, in the first year, and in the second, and the third.” H.—After paying tribute three years, the Ammonites revolted, and were subdued by Joatham, as they had been by his father. C. 26:7.  
**7** *Wars*, with Rasin and Phacee. 4 K. 15:37.—*Juda.* What concerned both kingdoms was carefully preserved; and Esdras informs us from what records he composed this work. C.

## Chapter 28

**3** *Benennon*, “the son of Ennom.” 4 K. 16.—*Consecrated.* Heb. “burnt.” H.  
**4** *Tree.* Remarkable for its size and beauty; as the heathens supposed that some deity lay there concealed. Mariana. T.  
**5** *Booty.* Heb. “number of captives.” H.—The two kings had besieged Jerusalem without success: (4 K.) but now their forces were divided. M.—The motives of this war were unjust. Mic. 2:8.  
**7** *At the same time*, is not in Heb. ( C.) or Sept. H.—*Zechri*, one of the generals of Phacee, slew the king’s son, &c. after the engagement.—*Next.* Joseph and Aman enjoyed the like dignity. Gen. 41:42. Est. 13:3. The high priests had also *seconds.* 4 K. 25:18. Sept. “vicar of the king.” C.  
**9** *Heaven*, and cries for vengeance against you. Though God designed to punish his people, your cruelty will not be excused. H.—The effect of this remonstrance, shews that all the kingdom of Israel was not devoid ( C.) of feeling and religion. H.—They set a noble example for Christian princes to follow after a victory. D.  
**10** *God*, who forbids this. Lev. 25:43. Mic. 2:8. 9. Heb. “are there not with you, yea, with you, sins against?” &c. If Juda have deserved punishment, reflect if you also be not guilty, v. 13. Sept. “Behold, am I not here with you to bear witness to the Lord?”  
**13** *Our*, is expressed in Heb. and Sept. These people justly confess that they stand in need of pardon, without adding fresh crimes. H.—The cruel treatment of the people of Juda, and the design to make them slaves, were grievous sins. C.  
**15** *Above.* Heb. “by name.” They deserved to be immortalized. H.—*Anointed.* This was very common, ( M.) and refreshing. Celsus i. 3.  
**16** *Kings.* Heb. “kings.” But Sept. have the singular. 4 K. 16:7.  
**17** *And.* Sept. “Because the Edomites had come, … and taken many prisoners.” Prot. “for again,” &c. H.  
**18** *Gamzo.* Syr. “Garam,” perhaps Gaza, ( C.) or a city south of Juda. M.  
**19** *Of Juda.* Heb. “Israel.” But the Sept. have “Juda.” H.—The names are often used promiscuously. C.—*For he.* Sept. “because he *or* it had apostatised from the Lord.”—*Script.* Prot. “he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore,” &c. Thus were the idolatrous Israelites exposed to shame and misery, after they had adored the golden calf. Ex. 32:25. H.—In the Bacchanalian riots, the pagans threw off their garments, to shew that they trusted entirely in their false gods. T.—Achaz had plunged his country in distress, ( C.) both of soul and body, ( H.) by his scandalous deportment. C.—*Of all help*, is added by way of explanation; ( T.) as God would no longer rescue his rebellious people from the hands of the enemy. H.  
**20** *And.* Heb. and Sept. “And.… the king.… came against him, and smote him.” Heb. continues, “but strengthened him not” in the end; though he had been invited, (v. 16. H.) and had actually made a diversion in favour of Achaz. But not being satisfied, he afterwards returned, and made cruel havoc in the country, imposing tribute upon the king, v. 21. 4 K. 16:7 and 18:7. It is therefore unnecessary to correct the Heb. with Grotius, to make it agree with 4 K. 16:7. Thus—he “came to his aid, and relieved him from his distress, (v. 21,) and granted him assistance.”  
**21** *Gifts.* Tribute. C.—Heb. “and gave it to, &c.: but he did not help him.” H.  
**22** *Moreover.* Sept. “but to distress him.”—Wicked policy availeth nothing, but entails much evil. W.—*King.* Heb. “that king Achaz.” The sacred writer thus stigmatizes the impious king, who grew worse the more he was scourged. H.—This was the monster, which could not be tamed. Amama.—*Eva.* “ille,” is five times used as a reproach, and often to signify applause. Kimchi.—*By himself*, is an addition. Amama.—It gives us to understand ( H.) that Achaz acted thus of his own accord. C.—Sept. “And king Achaz said, (23) I will studiously seek the gods of Damascus, who have buffetted me,” &c. H.—This resolution he took while the arms of Rasin were formidable to him: but he put it in execution after the king of Assyria had delivered him, when he went to Damascus to return him thanks. 4 K. 16:10. This stupid blindness and impiety irritated God so much, that he abandoned Juda to the arms of the king, who had been called in as a protector. How could he expect aid from gods who had suffered their own country and people of Damascus to fall a prey to the invader! C.  
**24** *God:* first through fear of the Assyrian, (4 K.) but afterwards he permitted it to continue in the same state of irreligion. C.—So easily do people fall into this abyss, who begin to neglect instruction! H.—Ezechias took care to open the temple again. C. 29:3. C.—None of the former kings had dared ( H.) to prohibit the worship of the true God. T.  
**27** *Israel* is put as comprising Juda. H. C. 20:34 and 24:16. &c. C.

## Chapter 29

**1** *Abia.* The last syllable is neglected, 4 K. 18:2. H.—Some assert that she was a descendant of the high priest, who had been stoned. S. Jerom, Trad. C. 24:20. T.  
**3** *Reign*, in the assembly, which met to recognize his authority. Lyran.—*Them*, adorning them with plates of gold. 4 K. 18:16.  
**4** *Street*, or court, before the eastern gate. C.  
**5** *Sanctuary*, or temple, v. 7. The Jews suppose that idols had been placed in the very sanctuary: (Lyran) but why then were the doors shut? C.  
**7** *Sanctuary*, or court of the priests, where the victims were slain. The blood of some was taken into the most holy place, on the day of expiation. C.  
**8** *Trouble.* Heb. zuáe, ( H.) is rendered vexation. Isai. 28:19. Sept. “ecstasy.” The Jews were frequently driven from their homes. M.—There were at a loss what to do, confounded and despised. H.  
**9** *Wives.* C. 28:8. C.—So had the wives and family of king Joram been treated. C. 21. H.  
**10** *Covenant*, swearing to observe the law given by Moses. M.  
**11** *Negligent.* Heb. adds, “now,” when every thing tends to open your eyes. H.  
**16** *Cedron*, as Josias did with the idolatrous altars. 4 K. 23:12. The priests brought what was unclean from the inner temple into the porch. H.—This labour lasted eight days, as the cleansing of the porches had done. C. D.  
**17** *Month*, Nisan, corresponding with our March, ( M.) when Ezechias began his reign. Salien, A. 3309.  
**19** *Defiled.* Heb. “cast out ( C.) in his.”—*Forth.* Heb. and Sept. “We have prepared and purified, behold they are,” &c. H.  
**21** *Seven.* Only one was prescribed for sins of ignorance. Lev. 4:13. 22. S. Jer. Trad.—But the late transgressions were of a different nature; and the king consults his zeal, rather than what he was absolutely obliged to do.—*Juda*, to expiate the sins of the royal family, of priests, and people.  
**23** *They laid.* The king and princes of the people confessed their sins. Lev. 4:15.  
**25** *Prophet.* Moses had not required music, except on some occasions. Num. 10:10. But David acted by God’s authority. The institution was designed to promote piety, and a love for religious meetings. Such sacred ceremonies are not to be considered as human inventions, *for it was*, &c. They command our utmost respect. C.  
**27** *Prepared*, or ordained. M.—Heb. “with the instruments, by David.”  
**30** *Princes* of the priests. H.—*Words;* psalms. T.—*Asaph*, so famous for music. He had composed some psalms, ( C.) and twelve bear his name. T.—But he might only have set them to music, ( H.) or his band sung them. D.—*Knee.* Prot. “head.” Sept. “they prostrated themselves.”  
**31** *Added.* Heb. and Sept. “answered,” a term used in Scripture, though no question had been proposed. H.—*Filled.* You are, in some sense, priests. Prot. “you have consecrated yourselves.” The *people* brought victims but the priests poured the blood round the altar, v. 34. H.  
**33** *Sheep*, for peace-offerings. Jun. C.—They destined these victims for the use of the temple, ( T.) that none might be wanting afterwards. C.  
**34** *Holocausts*, as the law required. Lev. 1:6. See C. 35:11. The skin might be taken off other victims, by laics.—*Priests.* Syr. “The Levites were more timid, *or* reserved than the priests, to purify themselves.” C.—Both are indirectly accused of negligence. C. 30:15. The Heb. seems to give the preference to the latter, “for the Levites were more upright of heart, (Sept. willing) to purify themselves than the priests.” But the Alex. Sept. may well agree with the Vulg. The ceremonies attending the purification of both, may be seen Ex. 29:1. Num. 8:6. H.—The priests had not sufficient time to collect themselves with the purity required, on such a short warning; and the paucity induced the king to put off the Passover till the next month. C. 30:3. 15.  
**36** *Because.* Heb. and Sept. “that the Lord had disposed his people, for the thing was done suddenly,” ( H.) to place no obstacle to this sudden change from one extreme to the other, at a time when the king was scarcely established on the throne. C.—Thus the people of England rejoiced, when the Catholic religion was re-established by the means of queen Mary and cardinal Pole. Philips. 9.—But the minds of the people are very fickle. *Regis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis* *.* Still the joy may show, that all love for truth is “not extinct,” as the Cardinal argued from the people’s conduct. Poli. ep. H.

## Chapter 30

**1** *Manasses.* The pious king thought he might give a general invitation, without umbrage. King Osee was not so impious as his predecessors. 4 K. 17:2. Afflictions had made his people more docile. The Jews say ( C.) that the golden calves had been taken away by the Assyrians, and that the king removed the guards, which had been placed to hinder his subjects from repairing to Jerusalem. M. Salien, A. 3305.—Ezechias writes privately to the house of Joseph, as the people were prouder on account of the royal dignity. S. Jer. Trad.  
**2** *Month.* The Rabbins pretend that the king intercalated the second Adar, contrary to the rule and advice of the wise, and the that he ought to have allowed those who were pure to celebrate the feast in due time. Selden, Syn. ii. 1.—But the Caraite Jews deny this pretended leap-year; and we see that Ezechias acted according to the advice of the princes, and that the Scripture praises his conduct. C.—Those who had a lawful impediment, were authorized to put off the feast till the second month. Num. 9:10. The nation was under this predicament, as they had not priests at hand, ( T.) nor were they assembled. D.  
**5** *Many.* None had kept the *Phase* this year. H.—But those of Israel had not done it for a long time. Grotius.—Heb. “for they had not long *before* done according to the Scripture.” Sept. “the multitude had not done,” &c. C.—Yet, even in the worst times, Tobias, (1:6) and other zealous souls, contrived to comply with their duty. H.  
**6** *Posts.* Lit. “runners or couriers.” H.—*King.* Heb. “kings.” Phul and Thelgathphalnasar. The latter had taken away some tribes. 4 K. 15:20. 29. C.  
**7** *Destruction.* Sept. “solitude.” Prot. “desolation.”  
**8** *Yield.* Lit. “give your hands,” ( H.) in sign of submission ( C.) and fidelity. Sept. “give glory.”  
**9** *Brethren.* God sometimes spares one for the sake of another. H.  
**10** Zabulon*.* Aser and Nephthali lay more to the north. But they were also invited, as well as the few who might remain on the other side the Jordan. 1 Par. 5:26. At least, we find that some of Aser *came*, v. 11. Thus those, who had been invited last, came first, while Ephraim continued more stubborn; (v. 18) and the greatest part derided the messengers, as we still see too frequently verified in the days of the gospel. H.  
**11** *Yielding.* Sept. “were converted.” Prot. “humbled themselves, and came.” H.  
**12** *Hand;* grace ( M.) and power, to endure such unanimity.  
**14** *Burnt*, both vessels and altars. C.—*To idols*, corresponding with the Sept. “the false ones,” and is added by way of explanation, unless it be lost in Hebrew. The illegal ( H.) *altars* had been set up by Achaz. C. 28:24. M.  
**15** *At length.* Sept. “were converted.” Heb. “ashamed, and sanctified themselves.” H.—The ceremonies of purification for priests were longer, (C. 29:34) and the sacred ministers were ashamed to be outdone by the people. M.  
**16** *Levites*, who received the paschal lambs from the unsanctified. M.—The law does not require the ministry of the tribe of Levi for this purpose, as each one might kill the paschal victim at home. But the people were not sufficiently purified on this occasion. Lyran.—At other times, laics killed the victims, if they were clean. Ex. 12:6. After the tabernacle was set up, the priests poured out the blood on the altar; and, in latter ages, they slew the victim according to Grotius. But the texts of Josephus (x. 5 and Bel. vi. 45. Lat. vii. 17. H.) are inconclusive; and Philo repeatedly assert that, on one day, the law authorizes all the people to sacrifice: and, though he lived at Alexandria, his testimony respecting a fact of public notoriety, is not to be rejected. Only the unclean applied to the Levites on this occasion, and the latter had no more right to sacrifice than the rest. C.  
**17** *For.* Prot. “for every one *that was* not clean, to sanctify *them* unto the Lord.” Sept. “not able to be purified to the Lord.” H.—The priests alone continued to pour the blood on the altar, till the destruction of the temple. C.  
**18** *Ephraim and.… Issachar* had not been mentioned before, v. 18. H.—Some indulgence was shewn to the tribes of Israel, which had been so long rebellious, for fear lest they should return no more; and because they had shewn a good will in procuring the Levites to slay the victims for them, as that was rightly judged a more sacred action than to partake of the feast. The law forbade, nevertheless, the unclean to approach to any thing sacred. Lev. 15:31 and 22:4. Num. 9:6. C.—But a dispensation was granted, ( M.) as the Passover could not be celebrated in any but the first or the second month. The people had come with such eagerness, that they had not time to acquire the purity required. C.—They were however truly penitent, and God dispensed with them. W.  
**20** *Merciful;* lit. “appeased.” Heb. and Sept. “healed.” S. Jerom (Trad.) says, “It was asserted that no unclean person could taste the Phase, but death presently ensued; and they understood that the Lord was appeased, because those who eat did not die.” H.—Heb. girpa may, however, denote that God “pardoned,” or did not impute the uncleanness to the people. Schindler, and C. 36:16 and Isai. 6:10.  
**21** *Days.* It seems all the observances had been omitted in the first month. The Jews teach, that those who have complied with those prescriptions, which require no particular purity, are not bound to keep the festival for seven days, nor to abstain from leavened bread the second month.—*That agreed.* Heb. and Sept. “of strength,” sonorous, ( M.) which they played on with all their force, or which sounded for the divine power. C.  
**22** *Heart;* encouraged them to bear the fatigue for other seven days.—*Lord;* being of good dispositions, ( C.) and able musicians. Sa. M.—*Praising.* Prot. “making confession to.” But the sense is the same. H.—During the seven days, unleavened bread and peace-offerings were used, v. 24. C.  
**23** *Joy*, though not prescribed by the law. M.—This we should call a work of supererogation, ( W.) which gives Prot. so much offence. H.  
**25** *Proselytes*, who had embraced the Jewish law: the rest were not allowed to partake of the paschal victims. Ex. 12:48.  
**26** *Israel:* as many of the tribes came to join with their brethren of Juda.  
**27** *Levites.* These only applauded the solemn blessings, which were given by the priests. Num. 6:24. C.—God is said to reside in heaven, because he there displays his glory to the blessed. D.

## Chapter 31

**1** *Manasses*, whether king Osee consented, or the people of Juda followed the dictates of their zeal, neglecting the regular order of things, which forbids the subjects of one kingdom to interfere thus with those of another. Grotius. S. Aug. q. in Deut. 7. and 12.—If Ezechias gave orders, we may suppose that he was assured of his neighbour’s consent. Josias (C. 34:6) followed his example after most part of Israel was led away captive, and the country obeyed the king of Assyria. C.  
**2** *Praise:* lit. “confess.” H.—There is a confession of God’s perfections, as well as of sin. W.—*Gates*, within their respective courts. C.—The Turks style the palace of their emperor, “the sublime porte.” H.—*Camp*, or temple. Sept. “in the gates, in the courts of the house of the Lord.” M.—Grabe has not *in the gates.* H.—We know that they did not sing there, but in the courts, ( C.) or halls. H.  
**3** *Substance.* Since David had place the ark in the palace of Sion, it seems the kings had furnished the solemn victims for morning and evening, on all the festivals. Solomon also engaged to do it every day; and his magnificence herein astonished the queen of Saba. C. 8:13 and 9:4 and 3 K. 9:25. Ezechiel (45) assigns revenues to the *prince* for this purpose; but, as the people were often without any, they paid each the third part of a sicle, to furnish the victims. 2 Esd. 10:32. C.—The king did not wish to exempt himself from contributing, while he required that the people should support the priests. The troublesome times had greatly impaired the revenues of the temple, &c. T.  
**4** **Ve** **r.** **4** **.** *Portion.* Lit. “parts,” ( H.) first-fruits and tithes. M.—*Lord*, without being taken off by worldly cares. It would be well if Christian princes would make an adequate provision for the ministers of religion: (v. 16. T.) as the law of nature dictates, that those who serve the public should be supported by it. D.  
**5** *Honey* for the priests, not for sacrifice. Lev. 2:11. It may include dates, or palm wine. See Pliny xiii. 4. C.—*Forth;* only wheat, barley, the fruits of vine, olive, pomegranate, fig, and palm-trees. R. Solomon. Lev. 27:30. C.  
**6** *Things*, out of which the Levites had to give tithes to the priests. Lyran. Num. 18:26. M.—*Vowed.* Heb. “consecrated to.… God, and laid them in heaps.” H.  
**7** *Them*, bringing from Pentecost till the harvest was ended.  
**10** *Sadoc*, being his grandson, (1 Par. 6:12. C.) or the father of Sellum. Jun.—*People*, with abundance; so that more would belong to the priests. C.  
**11** *Storehouses.* Sept. παστοφορια. Solomon had prepared such. T.—But they had gone to ruin, and others might be requisite. C.—The old granaries were to be repaired. M.—People brought their first-fruits to the temple: but the Levites gathered the tithes, and gave a share to the priests, and to those who were on duty. 2 Esd. 10:36.  
**12** *Second;* his vicar or coadjutor. C. C. 26:11 and 28:7. M.  
**13** *High:* lit. “pontiff.” H.—Heb. “captain.” He is styled first priest, v. 10. C.—*To whom*, &c. is neither in Heb. nor in the Sept. M. C. D.  
**14** *And of.* Prot. “To distribute the oblations of the Lord, and the most holy things,” ( H.) to the priests.  
**16** *Besides*, (*exceptis* *.* C.) not to mention. H. See Lev. 23:38. Girls are included, v. 18. It is supposed ( C.) that children were at the breast till they were three years old, and therefore no portion is assigned them before. Mariana.  
**17** *Upward.* Ezechias followed the regulation of David, rather than that of Moses, who deferred the service till the 25th or 30th year. Num. 4:3 and 8:24. 1 Paralipomenon 23:24.  
**18** *To all.* Prot. “the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness.” H.—All complied with their respective duties; the people, the distributors, and the priests. C.  
**19** *Aaron.* Heb. and Sept. add, “the priests,” ( M.) which is sufficiently understood.—*And in.* Heb. “of.” H.  
**20** *God.* This is the highest praise that can be given to a prince; and, in effect, we read there was none like him. 4 K. 18:5. C.—Sept. omit *and truth.* Ezechias loved it, and sincerely desired to serve the Lord. H.

**1** *Truth*, and sincere piety of the king, God was pleased to put him to trial; ( T. M. D.) or, “after these things were established.” Jun.—Sennacherib attacked Juda when Ezechias had been fifteen years on the throne, and till that time had paid the stipulated tribute. 4 K. 18:13. C.—He now probably refused to pay it any longer. Salien, A. 3319. M.  
**2** *Jerusalem;* as many cities had fallen. The king entered into an agreement with the Assyrians, who soon broke it.  
**3** *City.* The torrent Cedron afforded the only good supply of water. It was often dry, and was only three steps across, when full of melted snow or rain. The waters of Siloe and Gihon were collected in it. Yet it was no difficult enterprise for the king to turn the stream, and introduce the waters through the rock into a large reservoir, in the city, by the canal, which is mentioned 2 Esdras 2:14. Eccli. 48:19. The besieged were more frequently deprived of water. Judith 7:6. Babylon was taken by Semiramis, Cyrus, and Alexander, after they turned aside the waters of the Euphrates; and Cæsar obliged the town of Cahors to surrender, by intercepting the springs. Frontin. iii. 7. C.  
**4** *Land*, Cedron, on the east; ( C. M.) or it may be the Gihon, which supplies Siloe, v. 30. T.  
**5** *Without*, of less strength.—*Mello*, the palace, which was strongly situated, and Ezechias added fresh fortifications. 2 K. 5:9.—*Arms.* Heb. “darts.”  
**6** *Gate*, where there was a room for assemblies. 2 K. 18:24. C.—*Heart*, in the most affectionate and pathetic manner. H.  
**7** *More:* God and his angels, from whom he expected relief, and was not disappointed. 4 K. 6:16 and 19:35. C.  
**9** *Lachis*, whence he sent Rabsaces. Other blasphemous letters were dispatched from Lobna, (v. 17) when Sennacherib was forced to go to meet Tharaca. 4 K. 19:9.  
**12** *His altars.* Rabsaces was ignorant of the law, and upbraids the king for a commendable action. C.—Thus our adversaries foolishly blame us for keeping holy days and abstinence. H.  
**17** *He* (Sennacherib) *wrote*, when he was going towards Egypt. Both master and servant employed the same fallacious argument; as if the true God and idols were all upon a level, and as if past success were a sure proof of future victories, v. 19. H.  
**21** *Army.* Heb. “camp.”—*Disgrace.* The Jews pretend that he was deprived of his beard and hair, (S. Jer. Trad.) misapplying the text of Isai. 7:20. C.—*Sword*, to prevent their being offered as victims, to appease the idol and the people. R. Solomon. Lyran.—This happened some months after the king’s return to Ninive, when he had cruelly oppressed the captive Jews and Tobias, 1:24. T.  
**23** *Many;* probably strangers. 3 K. 8:41.  
**24** *Sign.* See 4 K. 20.  
**25** *Up*, by riches, and the splendid embassy from Babylon. C.—Prosperity is more dangerous than adversity. W.—Few are able to bear good fortune with moderation. H.  
**27** *Arms.* Heb. “shields.” Sept. “arsenals.”  
**30** *Underneath* the walls of the city, making them run westward. C. 33:14.  
**31** *Wonder*, at the defeat of Sennacherib; (Grot. D.) or rather the retrogradation of the sun, as the Chaldees studied astronomy with diligence. M. T. C.—*Left* *him*, in punishment of his vanity. H.—*Heart.* How feeble is man when destitute of the divine assistance! M.—God permitted, therefore, the king to be tempted, ( C.) that he might know himself, and that others might have a true idea of him. D.  
**33** *Above*, for distinction’s sake: ( C.) *meriti prærogativâ* *.* S. Jer. Trad. M.—The cell was either higher than the rest, or a sort of pyramid was erected over the tomb of Ezechias. C.

## Chapter 33

**3** *The host of heaven.* The sun, moon, and stars, ( Ch.) in imitation of the Phœnicians and ancient Chanaanites.  
**5** *Courts* of the Gentiles and of Israel, ( M.) though afterwards he also placed idols even in the court of the priests, v. 7. Salien, A. 3340.—But we find no express mention of the court of the Gentiles, till after the captivity; ( C.) so that the two courts mean those of the priests and of Israel. Villalpand, Sa. &c.  
**6** *Valley.* Heb. Ge-ben-hinnon, “the vale of the son of Ennom,” ( H.) a Jebusite, who had formerly possessed that part of the valley of Cedron. M.—Syr. write Gena, whence comes γεεννα a place at the foot of Moria, and the sink of the city. A constant fire was kept up to burn dead bodies. Kimchi. D.  
**7** *Graven.* Prot. “a carved image (the idol which he had made) in,” &c. It seems to have been sacred to the grove, ( H.) or a representation of Astarte, 4 K. 21:7. The ark was taken away, (C. 25:3) to make place for this impure deity, which had four (S. Basil) or five faces, (Euseb. Salien) that people might adore it on all sides.  
**9** *Seduced.* Using the arts of seduction, as well as open force. Heb. “Manasses made Juda.… err,” 4 K. 21:16. There is a fund of malice in the human heart, which easily prevails on people to yield, on such occasions, if the grace of God do not support them. Yet, as they are not still without a sense of duty and religion, many will readily comply with the invitations of a pious king, when he earnestly endeavours to reform his people. But these conversions too frequently prove false and unstable. C. 29:36. H.  
**10** *Spoke*, by his prophets. 4 K.  
**11** *Captains;* probably Tharthan. A. 3328. About five years before, Asarhaddon had made himself master of Babylon, to which place the captive king was brought, in the 22d year of his reign. 4 K. 20:10. &c. Isai. 22.—*And carried.* Heb. “among the thorns, and bound him with fetters (Prot.) of brass; (Jun. &c.) or, “they took Manasses with a hook,” insidiously. He might have retired to some desert place, as the Israelites did, to avoid the fury of the Philistines. 1 K. 13:6. C.—*Chains.* Vatable says, “two.” M.  
**12** *Distress.* “When he had been conducted to Babylon, and cast into a brazen vessel full of holes, over a fire, he called upon all the names of the idols, which he was accustomed to adore; and, as he was not heard, nor set free by them, he recollected what he had often heard repeated by his father: When though shalt call upon me in tribulation, and shalt be converted, I will hear thee graciously; as it is written in Deut. (see C. 4:29. H.) and his prayer was thus heard by the Lord, and he was delivered and brought back to his kingdom, like Habacuc.” S. Jer. Trad.—The author of the imperfect work on S. Matthew, (among the works of S. Chrys. hom. 1. H.) says, that Manasses was barely allowed as much barley bread, and water mixed with vinegar, as would keep him alive. Whereupon, remembering the Lord, he had recourse to his clemency, and a miraculous flame surrounded him, and dissolving his chains, set him at liberty. Saos-duchin, the successor of Azarhaddon, probably restored him to his throne, some years after his captivity, or perhaps that very year, so that his repentance continued thirty-three years. C.—*Prayed*, a proof of the efficacy of sincere repentance. W.  
**14** *Without*, including what is styled the *s* *econd* city; (4 K. 22:14,) or he perfected the works begun by his father, or repaired the wall which the Assyrians had thrown down, though we read not of their taking the city. C.—*Fish-gate.… to Ophel*, from the north-eastern corner, to the place opposite to the eastern gate of the temple. C. 27:3. M.—The fish-gate led towards Joppe, whence the city was supplied with fish. S. Jer. Trad.—It was also called David’s gate, because it stood near this city. By it, the Chaldees afterwards rushed in. Soph. 1:10. T.  
**16** *And praise.* Prot. “thanks-offerings.” Sept. “a victim of salvation and praise.” H.—The sacrifice might be accompanied with canticles.—Ps. 26:6, &c. C.  
**17** *God.* Heb. adds, “only,” and not to idols. H.—This worship was not superstitious, but it was illegal; and it is a misfortune, that Manasses had not as much influence to guide the people in virtue, as he had formerly, to induce them to follow his example in idolatry. C.—He could not prevail upon them to destroy the high places. M.  
**18** *Prayer*, which is not extant in Heb. but in Greek and Latin. As yet it is neither received for canonical, nor rejected by the Church. W.—*Israel.* That kingdom had been overturned in the sixth year of Ezechias. There was now no need of distinguishing the kings of Juda from those of Israel. The former seemed to have claimed authority over the whole country. 4 K. 23:19. H.  
**19** *Contempt.* Heb. “prevarication.” Sept. “apostacy.” M.—*Chozai* means “seers.” Sept. Prot. H.—But it more probably signifies some particular prophet, ( C.) Isaias, (S. Jer. Trad.) “Hanan,” (Syr.) or “Saphan.” Arab. version. C.—This work, less than the book of the kings of Israel, is now lost. M.  
**20** *House*, in his own gardens, and not with the other kings. Grot. C.  
**22** *Made*, though he had afterwards destroyed them. Amon endeavoured to restore their worship, ( C.) adoring the same idols, and making other statues in their honour. D.  
**23** *Sins*, inasmuch as he died in his guilt. Prot. “but Amon trespassed more and more,” ( H.) following the former bad example of Manasses, Jer. 15. D.  
**25** *Them.* Heb. “all that had conspired against king Amon.” H.

## Chapter 34

**3** *Boy;* 16 years old. D.—The kings of Juda were in their minority, till they had completed their 13th year. Grotius.—*Cleansed.* Heb. and Sept. “in the twelfth year he began to purify,” &c. H.—The work was not brought to perfection till six years afterwards, v. 8. C. T.  
**4** *Idols.* Heb. chammanim, ( H.) “statues of the sun.” The term often denotes those open enclosures, where sacred fire was kept in honour of the sun. C.—Sept. “the heights above them.” Syr. “he destroyed the altars, idols, tigers, and temples, (5) the bracelets, little bells, and all the trees which had been consecrated to idols.” Arab. “the altars, idols, and leopards.”  
**5** *Priests*, whom he slew *upon the altars*, 4 K. 23.  
**6** *He.* Heb. “with their swords, ( C. Prot. mattocks) round about;” ( H.) or, “and in their deserts,” the inhabitants being removed. Sept. “in their places around.” Syr. and Arab. “in their public places.” All the interpreters have read differently from what we find in Heb. at present. Some may wonder that Josias should act thus, out of his own dominions. But the few Israelites who were left, had placed themselves under his protection; and as he made no ravages, and the Cuthites did not adopt the former superstitious practices of the country, they were not concerned to see the altars destroyed; nor were the kings of Assyria informed of, or interested to stop, these proceedings. C.—Josias followed the directions of the priests and prophets; ( M.) and many believe that the Assyrian monarch had given these territories to him, to hold, as his vassal; ( T.) or God restored them to the lawful king, (v. 9) having promised all those countries to the family of David, for the express purpose of keeping up his own worship among his chosen people, and for exterminating idolatry. H.  
**8** *Eselias*, or Assia. This man is alone mentioned, 4 K. 22:3. C.  
**11** *Houses*, or apartments of the temple, which were gone to decay. H.  
**12** *Of music* is expressed in Heb. and Sept. H.—These Levites were chosen, because they were not so constantly employed in the temple, ( C.) and they were not hired barely to inspect the works, and hence the expense was diminished.  
**13** *Masters:* literally, “master porters.” Prot. “officers and porters;” all Levites. H.—Jahath, &c. directed them that carried burdens, ( C.) as the Hebrew intimates; and in general, all the officers were chosen from the same tribe. H.  
**17** *Together:* lit. “melted down,” as the Heb. and Sept. signify. Coin was not yet used. C.—But the pieces of money, of whatever description, were collected. H.  
**22** **Ve** **r.** **22** **.** *Hasra.* Olda’s husband’s grandfather is styled *Araas*, 4 K. 22. H.—*Second* part of the city, near the temple, or near the second gate, or between the two walls. D.  
**28** *Peace.* The country enjoyed peace, as Pharao was gone; ( M.) and Josias did not witness the evils here denounced. T.—This was a blessing. W.  
**33** *In Israel*, who had fled into his dominions. See v. 6. C.—*They.* Sept. “he,” &c. Josias worshipped God with all his heart: but all Israel paid him, at least, an external adoration. H.

## Chapter 35

**3** *By whose.* Sept. “the powerful in Israel, that they might be sanctified to the Lord; and they put,” &c. Heb. “who instructed all Israel, the holy *people* of the Lord: Put,” &c. H.—*No more.* Heb. adds, “upon your shoulders;” ( H.) whence it is inferred, that it had been carried about the cities of Juda, under the impious kings, who would not suffer it in the temple. C.—Some believe that it was kept in the house of Sellum, the uncle of Jeremias, and husband of Olda. S. Jer. Trad. T.  
**5** *Families.* Heb. adds, “according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren, the people, ( H. or laics. C.) and the division of the families of the Levites.” All were placed, with great order, in the temple.  
**6** *Which.* Heb. “of the Lord, by the hand of Moses,” which ordinances he has written down. M.  
**7** *In.* Heb. “for the Passover-offerings, from the flock, lambs and kids, in number 30,000.” *Et reliqui pecoris*, is not expressed. H.—The small cattle might be intended for other sacrifices. M.  
**8** *Offered.* Heb. “gave to the people.” H.—*Rulers:* the first alone was high priest. C.—*Small cattle:* literally, cattle of different sorts;” *commixtim* *.* Prot. supply, “small cattle,” which is not in Heb. H.—Syr. and Arab. have, “sheep;” but we had best follow ( C.) the Sept. “sheep, both lambs and kids.” Either would suffice. Ex. 12:5.  
**9** *Cattle.* Prot. again supply these words. Sept. have, “sheep.” H.  
**11** *Blood* is expressed in the Sept. and understood in Heb. H.—*With.* Heb. and Sept. “from their hands;” ( H.) receiving it from the officers, who might slay their own victims, ( C.) unless they were unclean, ( C.) 30:17. H.—*Holocausts.* Heb. and Sept. speak of the paschal lambs. H.—Holocausts were regularly to be flayed by priests. Lev. 1:6. The hurry of the solemnity, ( C.) and necessity, here excused the Levites, ( M.) if we understand proper holocausts. H.  
**12** *Separated.* Sept. “prepared the holocaust to give; having taken notice to whom the victims belonged, before they took off the skin, ( M.) or rather, separating these from the other peace-offerings. Tournemine.  
**13** *Victims.* Heb. and Sept. “but the holy *offerings* they boiled.” See Ex. 12:9. H.  
**15** *Prophets.* Heb. “seer.” But Sept. &c. read in the plural. These were “prophets of the king,” ( H.) or masters of music. C.—Vulg. might insinuate that these three gave orders, as well as David. But they were in office under him, as people of the same name were, probably, under Josias. H.  
**18** *As Josias kept.* He displayed greater liberality ( E. See 4 K. 23:20) and devotion; and the festival had also been neglected for some time. W.  
**20** *Charcamis* belonged to the Assyrian monarch, (Isai. 10:9) who subdued the empire of Babylon. C. 33:11.  
**21** *With me.* Grotius thinks that Jeremias had given the order; and the author of Heb. Traditions, supposes that he forbade Josias to oppose Pharao, who, it seems, was assured of victory. C.—But this is uncertain; and Josias might justly suspect that the king of Egypt spoke without authority. H.—The augurs of the latter might declare the truth, ( M.) though they could not dive into futurity. H.—Herodotus (i.) informs us, that Nechos fought against the Syrians, (or Israelites) in Magdelum, and took Cadythis, a city as large as Sardis, of Lydia; probably Jerusalem, ( D.) or Cades. C.  
**22** *Prepared.* Heb. “disguised himself,” like Achab; ( C.) or set his army in array. Sept. “he was bent on fighting him.” H.—He supposed that Pharao intended to invade his dominions, and God would withdraw him from the world. W.  
**24** **Ve** **r.** **24** **.** *After the manner of kings*, is not in Heb. &c. H.—Curtius (iv.) informs us, that the Persian monarch had always a horse behind his chariot, to be ready in case of any accident.  
**25** *Lamentat* *ions.* Some think that we have them in the Bible. Josephus, &c.—Others believe that they are lost. Salien, A. 3425.—*Law*, on the anniversary; ( M.) or when any calamity occurs, the lamentations of Jeremias are used. T.—There were collections of such poems, as well as of canticles, for victory and marriages. C.  
**27** *Israel* is placed first in Heb. and Sept. H.—The kings of Juda assumed the title, as the kingdom had been subverted above a century; and the wretched remains of Israel had retreated into the territories, ( C.) or acknowledged their dominion. H.

## Chapter 36

**3** *Him.* Joachaz had attempted to defend himself, and had been conducted prisoner to Reblatha. 4 K. 23:33 and Ezec. 19:4. He was now deposed in from, and a tribute laid upon the people. C.  
**4** *Brother.* From the time of David, the son had always succeeded his father. W.  
**6** *Babylon*, but sent him back soon after; ( T.) unless he altered his first design, ( D.) and slew him disgracefully at Jerusalem. Lyran. E. C. 4 K. 23:5.—He allowed him to reign as a vassal other three years, but took Daniel, &c. captives. The seventy years of Jeremias, (25:11) are to be dated from this event. A. 3402. Usher.  
**7** *The vessels.* Heb. and Sept. “a part of the vessels;” probably the *most precious*, (v. 10) breaking the rest in pieces, as he left none behind, v. 18.—*Temple* of his God. Dan. 1:2.  
**8** *In him.* The Jews explain this of the diabolical characters forbidden, Lev. 19:28. Carthusian. R. Sal. &c.—But it may simply denote the hidden sins of the king, which God will bring to light, or his rebellious conduct. Amama. Gen. 44:16. C.  
**9** *Eight years old.* He was associated by his father to the kingdom, when he was but eight years old; but after his father’s death, when he reigned alone, he was eighteen years old. 4 K. 24:8. Ch.—He only enjoyed the throne three months and ten days. T.—We must however observe, ( H.) that the Alex. Sept. the Syr. and Arab. read here, eighteen. C.—“It is, in my opinion, a pity that the translators have not mended such apparent errata of the scribe of the present Heb. out of 2 K. 24:8, or out of Sept. or out of common sense.” Wall. Kennicott.—These eight years may be dated from the captivity, and not from the king’s birth. Usher. D.  
**10** *Year*, in spring, when kings go out to war. C.—*Uncle.* Sept. “brother of his father,” which comes to the same sense, and was certainly the case. Heb. “his brother.” Abraham indeed gives the title to his nephew. Gen. 13:8. C.  
**13** *By God*, to be faithful. T.—This enhances his crime.  
**15** *Early.* Prot. “betimes, and sending: because,” &c. H.—Like a good master, God ( T.) sent his servants to work at day-break, ( H.) omitting nothing to induce them to return to him, that he might not be forced to punish them with severity. C.  
**16** *Remedy.* All attempts to convert them proved in vain; ( T.) and God, perceiving that they even despised his calls, became inexorable. C.  
**18** *Vessels.* Only a few remained, to be restored by Cyrus, v. 19. C.  
**20** *Sons;* Evilmerodac and Baltassar.—*Persia;* Cyrus, who subdued the country.  
**21** *Sabbaths*, every seventh year. Lev. 25:2 and 26:43. Jer. 25:11 and 29:10.—*Expired:* not that the earth was quite neglected, all that time, from the third year of Joakim, A.M. 3398 till 3468. C.—But it was almost: particularly after the murder of Godolias, ( M.) the public worship was at a stand, &c. H.—During this fifth age, the true religion subsisted invariable, not only in the kingdom of Juda, but also in that of Israel. See Worthington. H.  
**22** *First.* Cyrus had ruled over Persia from A. 3444. He was now emperor of the east. A. 3468. C.—These two verses are repeated by Esdras, which evinces that he was the author of this work also, ( T.) adding them when he restored ( W.) or revised ( H.) the holy scriptures. W.  
**23** *The Lord*, (*Jehova.*) In Esdras we find *yehi*, “Let,” *his God.* H.—*Up.* The sentence is completed in the following book, which makes it probable that these verses are here inserted improperly, by some transcriber. The book of Chronicles, though for many ages the last in the Heb. MSS. was, perhaps, once followed by Ezra, as in Camb. MS. 1. (Kennicott) and as it is now in the Protestant version, taken from the Heb. H.
