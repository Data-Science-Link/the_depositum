# 2 Samuel Commentary

**This** Book contains the transactions of David till the end of the pestilence, occasioned by his numbering the people. C. 24. The last six chapters of the preceding book were probably written by Gad, who delivered God’s orders to David, after he was deprived of the company of Samuel. Gad, Nathan, and other prophets, continued the sacred history, 1 Par. 29:29. After the unfortunate death of Saul, his general, Abner, instead of submitting quietly to the dominion of David, ( H.) set the son of the deceased monarch upon the throne, at Mahanaim; and two years elapsed before the rival kings came to open war. C. 2:10. Salien.—David was 30 years old when he was anointed at Hebron, (C. 5:4,) where he reigned seven years and a half over Juda. On the death of Isoboseth, he was anointed a third time, as king of all Israel, and reigned in that character 37 years. H.—The partisans of Isoboseth might be excused in their adherence to him, as he was the son of the late king, and the election of David was not sufficiently notified to them. Salien.—We here behold the many virtues of David, and his repentance for some faults into which he had fallen. His predictions, and the names and exploits of many of his valiant men, are likewise recorded. W.

## Chapter 1

**1** *Siceleg*, though it had been burnt down. Salien, A. 2949.  
**6** *Chance.* He feigned this to obtain the favour of David; but the king punished him as he deserved. W.—*Spear*, or sword, as it is before expressed. M.  
**8** *Amalecite.* The Rabbins say he was the son of Doeg; and has this appellation because Amalec sprung from Esau. Gen. 36:12. But this is all very uncertain. The man seems to have gotten possession of the marks of the royal dignity in the night, as the Philistines deferred till the next day stripping the bodies of the deceased. C.  
**9** *Anguish.* Heb. “the coat of mail withholds me.” Sept. “horrid darkness encompasses me.” *Shabah*, signifies a coat of mail, made of cloth, very thick, and boiled in vinegar, to render it more impenetrable. The Greeks emperors and the French formerly wore them much, instead of iron. C.—Prot. however agrees with us.—*In me.* I have yet received no mortal wound. H.  
**10** *I killed him.* This story of the young Amalecite was not true, as may easily be proved by comparing it with the last chapter of the foregoing book. Ch.—*Fall.* This he says, apprehending that David would perhaps disapprove of what he had done.—*Diadem*, or ribband, which was tied round his head, as a badge of his dignity. Heb. “the crown.” But it was not of metal, though such were already common. Ex. 28:36, 1 Par. 20:2. Some pretend that Doeg gave these insignia to this son, that he might ingratiate himself with the future king. But they were upon Saul, so that the enemy could easily distinguish him.—*Bracelet.* The Hebrews took a great many from the Madianites. Num. 31:50. Such presents were made by the Romans to soldiers who had performed some feats of valour. Plin. xxxiii. 2. Livy i. 10.  
**11** *Rent them*, in sign of grief, as many other nations did.  
**12** *Of the Lord*, the priests; (Abulensis) though it seems to be explained by the following words, of all the Israelites. H.  
**13** *Stran* *ger*, residing among the Hebrews.  
**16** *Head.* None but thyself can be answerable for thy death. See Matthew 27:25. David was already supreme magistrate, and he wished that all should be convinced that he rejoiced not at the death of the king, and that none might imitate the example of this wretch. C.—Thus Vitellius punished the murderers of Galba, “not out of respect to Galba; but, according to the custom of princes, as a protection for the present, and a threat of vengeance for the future,” in case any should dare to treat him in like manner. Tacit. i. *Tradito principibus more, munimentum i* *n præsens, in posterum ultionem* *.*  
**18** *Bow.* So this canticle was entitled, because it spoke in praise of the bow and arrows of Saul and Jonathan, v. 22. So one of the works of Hesiod is called “a buckler;” of Theocritus “a flute;” of Simmias “wing;” &c. Sept. have neglected this word entirely ( C.) in the Roman edition. But it is found in the Alex. copy, which reads “Israel,” instead of *Juda*, perhaps properly. Grabe, prol. iv. 2. H.—Chal. “to shoot with the bow.” Many suppose that David cautioned his men to exert themselves in that art, ( M.) as they might soon expect to have to encounter the Philistines, ( T.) who were very expert bowmen. W.—But the former interpretation seems preferable. C.—The bow might be also the beginning of some favourite song, to the tune of which ( D.) David would have his men to sing this canticle, ( H.) particularly when they went to battle. Grotius.—*Just.* See Jos. 10:3. M.—It seems this was a more ancient record, to which the author of this book refers. C.—He might have in view the canticle of Anna, (1 K. 2:4,) or some other. H.—The custom of composing canticles, on such solemn occasions, is very ancient and frequent. See 3 K. 13:23. and 13:29, Jeremias 48:31. Iliad ψ & χ. The style of this piece can hardly be equalled by the most polite writers. C.—David is chiefly occupied with the praises of Jonathan. H.—*Consider … places.* This sentence is omitted in Heb. Chal. Sept. and in some copies of S. Jerom’s version. T. i. p. 365, Nov. edit. op. It is a farther explication of the subsequent verse. C.—Yet the Sept. read, “Erect a pillar, O Israel, [upon thy heights; the Vat. Sept. places this after *slain.* H.] in honour of the slain, thy wounded *soldiers.* How are the mighty fallen?” The Hebrew seems to be different from what the Sept. Chal. &c. read, as the Masora now adopts etsbi, instead of etsib, which has greatly puzzled interpreters. Hence Aquila translates ακριβωσον, with the Sept. of Ximenes, i.e. “Execute *or* consider with attention,” this sepulchral monument on which you shall inscribe, “For the dead *and* for thy wounded.” It was to be placed on some “eminence,” according to custom. The present Heb. is very indeterminate, denoting “glory, a honey-comb,” &c. Ezec. 20:6, Dan. 11:16, 41. See Grabe, Prol. H.  
**19** *Illustrious.* Heb. “the glory (beauty, hart, &c.) of Israel hath been pierced,” &c. The comparison of Saul with a hart, is noble enough in the ideas of the ancients. Ps. 17:34, Cant. 2:9 and 8:14. Syr. and Arab. “O hart of Israel, they have been slain,” &c. C.—*Slain.* Heb. *chalal*, signifies also “a soldier;” and this word agrees perfectly well with giborim, “valiant,” both here and v. 22 and 25. Kennicott would apply it to Jonathan, upon whom David’s attention is mostly fixed. “O ornament of Israel! O warrior, upon thy high places! *How*,” &c. H.—In this manner many such pieces commence. Lament. 1. T.  
**20** *Triumph.* He was aware of the exultation of the infidels. H.  
**21** *Fruits*, which may be offered to the Lord. Inanimate things could not offend, nor does David curse them in earnest. But ( T.) nothing could more strikingly express his distress and grief, than this imprecation. It is false that those mountains have since been barren. This canton is one of the most fruitful of the country. Brocard. C.—Job (3) speaks with the same animation, and curses his day. M.—*Of Saul*, or “Saul, the shield of his people, was cast away, as,” &c. Prot. “*as though he had* not *been* anointed with oil.” H.—He is not reproached for throwing away his buckler, for nothing was deemed more shameful. The ancient Germans would not allow such a one to enter their temples or places of assembly. Tacit. mor. Germ.—A woman of Sparta told her son, when she delivered on to him, “Bring this back, or be brought upon it” dead. *Imposi* *tu scuto referunt Pallanta frequentes* *.* Æneid x. Sanctius. C.—*As though.* Heb. seems to have sh, instead of *s*, (as it is in several MSS. correctly, in noshug) and bli, instead of cli, (Delany) as the former word seems no where else to signify *quasi non* *;* and the Syr. Arab. and Chal. omit the negation. It might therefore be *the shield of Saul*, “the arms of him who has been anointed with oil.” Kennicott.—Some would refer this unction to the shield, (Vatab.) as this was some times done: ( M.) but the reflection would be here too trifling. C.  
**22** *From.* Heb. “without the blood of soldiers, without the fat of the valiant, the bow of Jonathan had never returned.” Kennicott.—*Fat.* The entrails. It might also denote the most valiant of the soldiers, as we read of “the fat or marrow of corn” for the best. Ps. 80:17. C.—Jonathan attacked the most courageous, and laid them dead at his feet. H.—*Empty.* Saul carried destruction wherever he went.  
**23** *Lovely*, or united. Jonathan always behaved with due respect towards his father, though he could not enter into his unjust animosity against David. C.—The latter passes over in silence all that Saul had done against himself, and seems wholly occupied with the thought of the valour and great achievements of the deceased. H.—Sanchez believes that these epithets were introduced of course into funeral canticles, like *Alas! my noble one*, (Jer. 22:18. M.) as Saul could have no pretensions to be styled lovely, or friendly, towards the latter part of his reign; since he treated the priests, David, and even his son Jonathan, with contumely, and even with unrelenting fury. But all this David would willingly bury in oblivion. He will not even notice how different was the end of the two heroes. Jonathan died like a virtuous soldier in his country’s cause; Saul was wounded, but impiously accelerated his own death, through dread of torments and of insult. Though they died, therefore, on the same field of battle, their end was as different as that of the saint and of the impenitent sinner. H.  
**25** *Battle.* Heb. “in the midst of battle! O Jonathan, thou warrior upon thy high places!” Kennicott, Diss. i. p. 123.  
**26** *Brother.* So they lamented, *Alas! my brother.* Jer. 22:18. M.—*Women.* He indicates the ardour of his love, not any inordinate affection. D.—I love thee more than any person can love a woman, ( C.) more than women can love their husbands or children. M.—Chal. “thy love is more wonderful to me than the love of two who are espoused.”—*As*, &c. This is not found in Heb. Sept. or S. Jerom. C.  
**27** *Perished*, falling into the hands of the enemy; though Saul and Jonathan may be styled the arms, as well as the shield, of Israel. M.—No character could be more worthy of praise than the latter. His breast was never agitated by envy, though he seemed to be the most interested to destroy David. Even Saul had many excellent qualities; which makes Ven. Bede compare him in those respects with Jesus Christ; as most of the memorable persons and events of the Old Testament had a view to Christ on the one hand, and to the Synagogue on the other. Saul is one of the most striking figures of the reprobation and conduct of the Jewish church. As he was adorned with many glorious prerogatives, and chosen by God, yet he no sooner beheld the rising merit of David, than he began to persecute him: so the Jews had been instructed by the prophets, and had been selected as God’s peculiar inheritance; and nevertheless took occasion from the virtues and miracles of the Son of God, to conspire his ruin. The Romans were sent to punish the Jews, who are now become the most abject of all mankind, and are filled with rage, seeing the exaltation of the Christian Church, as Saul was reduced by the Philistines to the greatest distress, and his children were forced to implore the protection of the man whom he had so cruelly persecuted, &c. C.—Saul and Judas may be a warning to us, that no person ought to live without fear, since they perished so miserably, though they had been elevated by the hand of God. S. Amb. &c. H.

## Chapter 2

**1** *Juda.* David thought it was his duty to co-operate with the designs of Providence. He consults the Lord ( C.) by means of Abiathar, (Abul.) or by a prophet. Joseph.—*Hebron*, ennobled by the patriarchs. M.—It was also in the centre of Juda, and the strongest place belonging to that tribe. C.—Part of Jerusalem was still in the hands of the Jebusites. H.  
**3** *Towns*, villages, and dependencies *of Hebron.*  
**4** *Juda*, without the concurrence of the other tribes, ( C.) which would be an evil precedent in a commonwealth, unless God had authorized them by the declaration of his will. Grot.—Samuel had before anointed David, and given him a right to the crown, ( W.) *jus ad regnum* *.* But this anointing gives him a right to govern, *jus in regno* *;* ( C.) or rather it proves, that the tribe submitted voluntarily to his dominion, which he had already ( H.) lawfully begun to exercise, when he put the Amalecite to death. Abulensis. T.—*Told*, perhaps by some ill-designing men, who wished to irritate David against those who had shewn an attachment to Saul, unless the king had made enquiry, thinking it his duty to bury the deceased. C.  
**6** *And truth*, or a real kindness. God will reward you for the sincere piety which you have shewn towards the dead. C.—*Will.* I do, by these messengers, thank you. Louis de Dieu.  
**7** *King.* He invites them to concur with the men of Juda, hoping that all Israel would be influenced by their example. But his hopes proved abortive, as Abner caused Isboseth to be proclaimed king in the vicinity at Mahanaim.  
**8** *Camp.* Heb. Machanayim, which many take for a proper name ( C.) of the town, on the river Jabok, where Jacob had encamped. Gen. 32:2. H.—Abner was aware that he should not retain his authority under David, and therefore conducted Isboseth to the camps in various places, ( M.) but chiefly on the east side of the Jordan, ( H. v. 29.) where the people were particularly attached to Saul’s family. Isboseth seems to have been a fit tool for his purpose.  
**9** *Gessuri* *.* There was one south of Juda: but this country was probably near Hermon, and might be tributary to Israel. David perhaps married this king’s daughter, in order to detach him from the party of Isboseth. C. 3:3. Heb. reads, “Assuri;” and S. Jerom observes, that many explained it of the tribe of Aser, (Trad. Heb.) with the Chaldee, ( D. M.) or of the Assurians. Gen. 25:3.—*I* *srael*, by degrees. In the mean time the Philistines occupied many cities, which might prevent Isboseth from attempting to fix his residence on the west side of the Jordan, v. 19.  
**10** *He reigned t* *wo years*, viz. before he began visibly to decline: but in all he reigned seven years and six months: for so long David reigned in Hebron. Ch. W.—The Jews admit of an interregnum in Israel of above five years, which is by no means probable. Two years elapsed before the two houses came to an open war; (Salien) soon after which, the power of Isboseth was greatly weakened by the defeat, and afterwards by the defection, of Abner. H.—Hence the sacred historian refers to the commencement of hostilities, and not to the end of Isboseth’s dominion. E. T. C.  
**12** *Servants;* guards, army. M.—*Camp;* or from Machanayim to *Gabaon*, in the tribe of Benjamin, about six miles from Jerusalem. C.—Sept. leave the former word untranslated, “Manaeim.” H.  
**14** *Play*, like the gladiators with drawn swords, which formed one of the principal diversions at Rome, ( C.) while it was pagan. This might be considered as a prelude to the ensuing engagement; or like a detachment of twelve on each side, fighting to shew the prowess of their respective armies; as the three Horatii and Curiatii did afterwards, to spare the effusion of blood. But there is no mention that Abner and Joab had authority to agree that these champions should decide the fate of the two kingdoms, ( H.) whence they are generally accused of ostentation; though the soldiers, not being acquainted with their motives, were obliged to obey. T. M.  
**16** *Together.* Some understand this only of Abner’s soldiers, as the original may be explained: “And they (David’s men) caught every on one his,” &c. But it is more generally believed that all fell. C.—Rufin has erroneously translated Josephus in the former sense, and has lead Comestor, Lyran, &c. into this opinion. T.—*Valiant.* Heb. “the portion of the smooth stones, (hatsurim, 1 K. 17:40. *o* *r*) of the brave.” C.  
**18** *Woods.* Swiftness was one great qualification of a warrior. C. 1:23. Homer generally styles Achilles, “the swift-footed.”  
**21** *Spoils.* Attack one who may be a more equal match for thee. H.  
**22** *Brother.* It seems they were great friends, though they had espoused different parties. C.  
**23** *Stroke*, (aversâ.) Heb. “with the hinder end of the spear, under the fifth *rib.*” Sept. “in the loin.”  
**24** *Wilderness*, or land which was not ploughed, though fruitful.  
**26** *Destruction.* Sept. “till *thou hast gained a complete* victory?” Chal. “to separation?” Must we come to an eternal rupture?—*Despair?* Heb. “that it will be bitterness in the end?” Abner insinuates that they had commenced in a sort of play, but the consequences had already proved too serious; and if Joab continued to pursue, his men would be rendered desperate. C.—Despair makes people perform wonders, to revenge themselves. M.  
**27** *Sooner.* Heb. “If thou hadst not spoken,” ( D.) by challenging, v. 14. Josephus, &c. C.  
**28** *Trumpet.* It was not dishonourable for a general to do this himself. C. 18:16. But among the Hebrews, the priests generally performed this office. C.  
**29** *B* *eth-horon.* Sept. “the extended plain.” Heb. Bithrun, ( H.) or the country towards the Jordan. C.—Thus the battle ended in his disgrace; ( H.) and many from all Israel began to flock to the standard of David. 1 Par. 12:22. T.  
**32** *Day*, after a march of ten hours. Adric. M.  

---

## Chapter 3

**1** *War*, the particulars of which are not given. C.—But David’s power continually increased, and he was blessed with many children. H.—“Legions and fleets are not such strong bulwarks of the throne, as a numerous family.” Tacit. Hist. v.  
**2** *Amnon*, who was murdered by Absalom, for his incest. C. 13:32. M.  
**3** *Cheleab*, or Daniel. 1 Par. 3:1. Sept. “Dalnia.” C.—Alex. “Dalouja.” H.—Others, “Abia.”—*Gessur*, not far from Damascus. The lady probably first embraced the true religion, though the Scripture seldom enters into these details. C.—David is never blamed for marrying strange women. Salien supposes that he entered into this alliance before the civil war broke out, that Isboseth, who had fixed his court at Mahanaim, might have an opponent near at hand. The fruits of this marriage were very unfortunate, and brought great distress upon David: so little do men know what will be the event of the most splendid connections! H.  
**4** *Adonias* was slain by Solomon, (3 K. 2:24. M.) for arrogating to himself the right of the first-born, and pretending that the crown belonged to him. H.—The names of his mother, and of those who follow, are barely known. Salien.  
**5** *Wi* *fe.* She was otherwise of no nobility, but perhaps loved by David more than the rest, as Rachel was by Jacob. The Rabbins would infer that Egla and Michol are the same person. But the latter had no children, (C. 6:23. Salien) and is mentioned v. 13.  
**8** *Concubine.* To marry the king’s widow was deemed an attempt upon the throne. 3 K. 2:22. Hence Solomon was so displeased at Adonias, v. 24. Some think that Isboseth formed the accusation on mere conjecture; but Abner does not deny the fact. C.—*Dog’s head:* of no account, like a dead dog; ( H.) or no better than a servant, who leads a dog. The Jews considered the dog as one of the vilest of animals. C. 9:8, Job 30:1.—*Juda.* This word is neglected by the Sept. Some would substitute Liduth, “to be cast away.” C.—God permits the defenders of a wrong cause to fall out, that the right one may be advanced. W.  
**9** *Sworn.* It seems therefore that he knew of God’s appointment, and had hitherto resisted it for his own temporal convenience. H.—If both he and Isboseth were ignorant of this decree, Abner had no right to deprive the latter of the crown. Abulensis, q. 7. M.  
**11** *Him.* And no wonder; since even David could not repress the insolence of his chief commander, v. 39. So Otho “had not yet sufficient authority to hinder the perpetration of crimes.” Tacit. Hist. i.  
**12** *Himself.* Heb. may be also “immediately,” (Piscat.) or “in secret,” (Kimchi) as the matter seems not to have transpired. C.—Sept. Alex. “to Thelam, where he was, without delay, saying, Make,” &c. H.—*Land?* Is it not thine? or have not I the disposal of a great part of it? M.  
**13** *Thee.* Could David thus authorize treachery? It is answered, that Abner knew that the throne belonged to him, and he was already responsible for all the evils of the civil war. David does not approve of his conduct, but only makes use of him to obtain his right.—*Michol* *.* He might justly think that the people would have less repugnance to acknowledge him for their sovereign, when they saw that he had married the daughter of Saul. she had never been repudiated by him. C.  
**14** *Isboseth* *.* Thus he would screen the perfidy of Abner, ( M.) and hinder him from using any violence. C.—The pacific king accedes immediately to the request, as he had no personal aversion to David, and saw that he was in a far more elevated condition than Phaltiel. H.—Moreover, this was no time to irritate him more, as Abner was discontented. M.  
**16** *Bahurim*, in the tribe of Benjamin. Adric. 28.  
**18** *Enemies.* We read not of this promise elsewhere. But how many other things are omitted in the sacred books? C.—Abner alleges God’s decree, that he may not be deemed a traitor. Cajet.  
**19** *Benjamin*, which tribe was naturally most attached to Saul’s family. They followed, however, the example of the ten tribes, and 20 of them accompanied their general to Hebron. Salien.  
**20** *Feast*, through joy at the reception of his wife, and of such good news. M.  
**21** *And may.* Some Latin copies read with the Heb. “and it (Israel) may enter,” *ineat* *.*  
**22** *Robbers.* Amalecites, (Salien) or Philistines, who had made some incursions into David’s territories. Abulensis.  
**25** *Dost.* This explains *going out*, &c. H.—Joab pretends to be wholly solicitous for the king’s welfare. But he was afraid lest Abner should take his place, and he also desired to revenge Asael’s death. M.  
**26** **6** **.** *Messengers*, in the king’s name.—*Sira.* See Judg. 3:26. Josephus says the place was 20 stadia from Hebron. Ant. vii. 1.  
**27** *Middle.* Sept. “sides.”—*Brother;* (who had been wounded in the same place) a just punishment of Abner’s licentiousness. Salien.—This was given out as the pretext of the murder; but envy seems to have been the chief promoter. M.—Joab treated Amasa in the same manner. C. 20:10. Ambition was his god. C.—Abisai was ready to assist him to murder Abner, v. 30. Thus the fairest prospects of union seemed to vanish, and David was sincerely grieved, as he manifested in the most decided manner, confessing it was only the want of power which prevented him from bringing these merciless and potent brothers, his own nephews, to immediate punishment, v. 39. H.  
**28** *Innocent.* I would not purchase a kingdom at such a price. C.—I beg that the crime may not be imputed to us, who are innocent. H.—God sometimes punishes a whole kingdom for the sins of the rulers. M.—Yet not without some fault of the subjects. H.  
**29** *Issue.* Such were looked upon as unclean, (Lev. 15:3,) and incapable of having children. Aquila translates zab, “blind.” Sept. “afflicted with the gonorrhœa.”—*Distaff*, like eunuchs. Delrio, adag. 190. Claud in Eutrop. *Tu telas non tela pati*, &c. Some translate a stick, with which the blind, lame and aged endeavour to walk. C.—Any of these conditions would be very mortifying to great warriors. H.—*Bread.* Hunger and famine were considered as a scourge of God. Ps. 58:7, 15, and 108:10. David is not moved with hatred, but foretells what will befall the posterity of these men, whose crime he abhors. C.  
**31** *Joab.* Requiring him to make some reparation, at least, for the offence, and to render the funeral pomp more solemn. All were obliged to rend their garments, and to put on sackcloth, on such occasions. It was very rough, and consisted chiefly of goat and camel’s hair.—*Bier*, contrary to the custom of kings. Some copies of the Sept. say, he “went before the bier,” ( C.) where women commonly were placed. Grotius.  
**33** *Died.* Heb. “Is Abner dead, like *Nabal*,” “a fool,” (Chal.) “like the wicked?” “Ought so brave a man to have died in this treacherous manner?”  
**34** *Iniquity.* David does not spare Joab, in this canticle, which was sung by all the people. C.—He intimates, that if he had not used deceit, Abner would not have been so easily overcome. H.  
**35** *David.* Heb. “to cause David to eat meat” ( H.) at the feast, which usually accompanied funerals. Gen. 50:3. C.  
**38** *Israel.* And that all this pomp is not unseasonable. M.—The chief, if not the only virtue of Abner, was military skill, or a blunt valour.  
**39** *King.* Sept. “and that I am to-day a relation, (by my wife) and appointed king by the king?” H.—He seemed as yet to have little more than the title. His throne was not well established; ( C. W.) and to undertake to punish the offenders now, might have had so pernicious consequences as the attempt of Isboseth to correct his general. H.—It is better to temporize than to increase the distemper, ( C.) by a fruitless zeal for justice. H.—The punishment was only deferred. 3 K. 2:5. M.—*Hard.* Powerful or insupportable. C.—This year was memorable for the death of Codrus, king of Athens. Salien, A. 2985.

## Chapter 4

**1** *Isboseth* is omitted in Heb. but understood. He is expressed in the Sept. The Alex. copy generally substitutes *Memphibosthai*, by mistake; as he (Miphiboseth) was the son of Jonathan, v. 4. H.—*Weakened.* Hitherto Abner had been the chief support of Saul’s family. His traitorous practices had been kept secret from Isboseth, ( C.) who hoped that his former declaration had been dictated by a sudden passion, and would not be carried into effect. C. 3:10. H.—*Troubled*, not knowing what turn things would now take, and fearing the resentment of the sons of Sarvia, though they were convinced of David’s good dispositions. Salien, A.C. 1067.  
**2** *Bands*, (*Latronum* *.*) Lit. “robbers,” or people who live on plunder, like the posterity of Ismael, and of Esau. Gen. 27:40. The life-guards of princes are often styled *latrones*, ( C.) from their being stationed at their “sides,” as if *Laterones.* M.  
**3** *That.* Heb. &c. “this day,” when the historian wrote. M.  
**4** *Miphiboseth* *.* All from *Beroth*, (v. 2,) may be included within a parenthesis, being only mentioned here to let us know the state of affairs, ( H.) and how the son of Jonathan could have no pretensions of the crown. Grot. C.—He would be almost 12 years old at the death of his uncle. H.  
**5** *At noon*, “to divide the day,” as Varro (3:2,) writes. This custom is very prevalent in hot countries.—*And the*, &c. is all omitted in Heb. and in most ancient MSS. of S. Jerom’s version. It is taken from the Sept. ( C.) who do not notice any farther the *taking ears of corn*, v. 6. H.—Probably the Heb. had this sentence formerly. D.—It was customary to have women to keep the doors; (Mat. 26:69,) and they were often employed in *cleansing wheat.* Petronius says, *in lance argentea pisum purgabat* *.* C.—The ears of corn, hardly ripe, were cleansed, and used as a delicious food. T. 1 K. 17:17. Sanctius.  
**6** *Corn.* Soldiers were paid with corn, instead of money. They came, therefore, under this pretext; or they brought some as a present to the king, (Liran) or pretended that they were come to purchase, ( M.) or bringing a sample to sell; ( T.) *ut emptores tritici* *.* Chal. Prot. “*as though* they would have fetched wheat, and they smote him under the fifth *rib.*”  
**7** *Parlour.* Heb. “bed-chamber.”—*Wilderness.* Avoiding places frequented. H.—The distance was about 40 leagues, which they could not travel in one night. C.—Adrichomius says it was 30 hours’ walk. Sept. “west-ward.” H.  
**8** *Life.* They wish to recall to David’s remembrance what Saul had done against him, that he may approve the more of what they had perpetrated. M.—They supposed that, as Abner had been well received, they should obtain still greater favour. Salien.  
**11** *Innocent.* Isboseth was such, at least, in their regard. He might also have mounted his father’s throne, *bona fide;* and, at any rate, it was not their business to decide the matter ( C.) in this treacherous manner. Thus Alexander punished Bessus, who had murdered his master, Darius, with whom the former was at war. H.  
**12** *Feet*, while they were alive, (Theodoret. M.) almost as Adonibezec had treated many; (Judg. 1:6,) or they were first put to death, and the parts cut off were fastened to a cross; as the head and right hand of Cyrus were by his brother Artaxerxes. Xenop. Anab. iii. C.—Josephus seems to be of the former opinion, saying, “he ordered them to be executed in the most excruciating torments,” “while the head of Jebosthe (Isboseth) was buried with all honour.” Ant. vii. 2.—Thus David convinced the people that he would punish crimes, when it was in his power, and that he would give no encouragement to the treason or perfidy of any one. H.

## Chapter 5

**1** *Tribes.* Thus were God’s promises sweetly fulfilled, and David obtained the quiet dominion over all Israel, excepting perhaps a few of the tribe of Benjamin, according to the Vulgate. 1 Par. 12:29. An army of 340,822 was collected on this occasion; and David signalized the commencement of his reign, by the taking of Jerusalem. C.—The tribe is Issachar is not specified in the text; but Josephus asserts, that 20,000 of them assembled; so that the army would amount to 359 (Salien) or 60 thousand, besides the 822. C.—These might be considered as deputies of all the rest of their brethren, 1 Par. 12:38. They were abundantly supplied with all necessities. Salien.—*Flesh*, of the same nation, as Moses had specified. Deut. 17:15. C.—They now relinquish all the seeds of division, which had before hindered them from joining with their brethren of Juda. Kennicott discovers several important alterations, by comparing this history with 1 Chron. 11. Dissert. i. H.  
**2** *Lead out* to battle. His experience in war was a great recommendation. H.—*Feed*, as a shepherd, under which character he is *first* represented. H.—Other rulers were afterwards honoured with the same title, ( C.) particularly the governors of the Church. Act. 20. &c. David’s name is written without *i*, in the books before the captivity; whence Kennicott would infer, that the canticles were perhaps not the work of Solomon, as the *i* occurs there; Duid for Dud. H.  
**3** *Ancients;* princes of the tribes, and officers, ( C.) with all the chief magistrates. H.—The high priest, Abiathar, received the oaths of allegiance from the people, and of the king, who promised to govern according to the laws of God. The ark was probably present, and innumerable sacrifices offered on this solemn occasion, as was usual. 1 Par. 12:26. Hebron continued to be a place of sacrifices. C. 15:7. C.—David had erected here a temporary altar and tabernacle, where Abiathar officiated in his pontifical robes, as it was not safe for the people to go into the dominions of Isboseth, either to Gabaon or to Cariathiarim. Tostat.—*Israel*, acknowledging the right which David had to the throne, by God’s appointment. H. W.  
**4** *Forty*, a round number, as another half year is specified below; ( C.) or Solomon might be crowned at the expiration of the 40th year. D.  
**6** *Land.* This was the only canton which the infidels still retained, as they had still possession of the citadel of Jebus, ( C.) though the Israelites had been in the country above 400 years. Ken.—Nothing could reflect greater glory on the beginning of David’s reign, than the seizing of this place, ( C.) which was deemed so impregnable, that the Jebusites thought *the blind and the lame* were sufficient to defend it. H.—They placed some upon the walls, ( M.) “despising him, on account of the strength of their walls.”  
**7** *Castle:* “the lower city,” (Josephus) spread over Mount Sion.  
**8** *Gutters.* Heb. Tsinnor, “through (Nodius) the subterraneous passage,” (leading to the tops of the houses.) Hugo of Vienna.—Thus Babylon was taken by Cyrus, who passed through the channel of the Euphrates, the waters of which he had let out; though the inhabitants had derided his attempt to take the city by siege, as the men of Jebus do here. Polybius says, “Rabatamana, a city of Arabia, could not be taken, till one of the prisoners shewed the besiegers a subterraneous passage, (υπονομον) through which the besieged came down for water.” Of the same nature were the gutters here spoken of. Ken.—“The king promised to give the command of the army to the man who would pass through the cavities (φαραγγον) below, and take the citadel.” Josephus.—This reward is expressly mentioned in 1 Paral. 11:6, with the person who obtained it; (S. Jer. Trad.) and it seems, after *David*, this ought to be inserted, “shall be the head and captain. And Joab, the son of Sarvia, went up first, and was made the general.” H.—*Hatred.* Heb. “that are hated by David’s soul.” Cajetan supposes that the Jebusites in the citadel, are thus distinguished from those who dwelt peaceably in the lower town, with the Israelites. C.—*Proverb.* Prot. insert, “*He shall be head and captain.* Wherefore they said, the blind … into the house.” What is translated *temple*, may denote also, “the house” of David, or “the place” where this provocation had been given. H.—Idols shall never be adored in the true Church. W.—Some think that the blind and the lame were excluded from the temple, or from David’s palace. But we find that they had free access to the temple; (Mat. 21:14, Acts 3:2) and Miphiboseth ate at David’s table, though he was lame. If the Jebusites be designated, they were already excluded from the temple, like other infidels of Chanaan. C.—Josephus (vii. 3.) insinuates, that “David drove them from Jerusalem,” though we read of Areuna residing there. C. 24:16. But he might be a proselyte before, and not dwell in the fort. The expression seems however to be proverbial, to signify any very difficult enterprize, which proves successful, and contrary to expectation. H.—The Jebusites were thus derided (Sanctius) in their turn. T.—Whether Joab took this strong place by a subterraneous passage, ( H.) or scaled the walls, and so got to the top, whence the water falls, as from a gutter; ( C.) it is certain that he displayed the utmost valour, and thus obtained the confirmation of his authority, which David would perhaps have willingly taken from him, (Salien) if another had offered himself, and performed this hazardous enterprize. H.—He made a fair offer to all Israel, as they probably expected. Kennicott.  
**9** *Inwards.* He built or repaired the higher “city of David,” beginning at *Mello*, to “fill up” the valley, which Solomon finished, and adorned with a palace. 3 K. 9:15, 4 K. 12:20. The place is probably called Asaramel. 1 Mac. 14:27. C.—Sept. and Josephus generally understand Mello to designate the citadel of Sion, or “a complete fortification,” to defend the city. Instead of *inwards*, the Sept. have, “and his house.” But ubithe means, “and to the house,” temple, or fort, whence he began the enclosure, so as to make a complete communication. Ken.—This city became “the most famous in all the East.” Plin. v. 14.—“Walls, built in a crooked manner, according to the rules of art, enclosing two hills, immensely high.” Tacit. Hist. v.—These hills were multiplied, on account of their different summits, so that Josephus speaks of five hills. The palace of David stood on Sion, the temple on Moria, which was a part of it still more elevated, towards the east. The other hill is often called Acra, by Josephus, and lay southward of Sion. Here the ancient town of Jebus was built. The Machabees took in an adjoining eminence. Joseph. Bel. vi. 6.—Bethsetta, or the new city, was afterwards enclosed. Herod adorned the city with may superb monuments, both of a public and of a private nature. C.—We read of ten gates, and of four towers, belonging to this city. It was not well supplied with water, and what it had was brackish. The walls seem never to have exceeded four and a half miles; now they are only three, and include Mount Calvary, which was formerly no part of the city. Button says a valley run from west to east, between the two hills of Zion on the south, and Acra on the north; which contradicts the former statement. H.—Villalpand supposes that the citadel was nine and a half stadia, and all the city thirty-five stadia in circumference, eight of which make an Italian mile. M.  
**11** *Hiram* was a magnificent prince, who kept up a correspondence with Solomon. He greatly adorned the city of Tyre. See Josep. c. Ap. 1.  
**12** *Over.* Heb. “for.” The king is bound to promote the welfare of his people. C.—But the same word means “over,” as the Prot. allow. H.—Success constantly attending David, was an earnest that the Lord had not rejected him. C.  
**13** *David took more concubines and wives of Jerusalem.* Not harlots, but wives of an inferior condition: for such in Scripture are styled *concubines.* Ch.—He had in all eight wives, and ten whom he married with less solemnity. He might desire to attach the principal families of the nation, as well as some foreign princes, to his interests. Moses forbids a king to have too many wives. Deut. 17:17. C.—But David is never blamed for the transgression of this precept. See C. 3:1. M.  
**16** *Eliphaleth* *.* Sept. reckon twenty instead of eleven. C.—The Vat. copy has twenty-four, as some of the names have been read differently, so as to make two persons, and thus frequently a double translation occurs in the Sept. the one being taken either from Aquila, &c. or from some more early version, of which we know not the author. Grabe. Kennicott, Diss. ii. p. 404.  
**17** *Seek*, or attack *David.* He went out to meet them. Par. But receiving an order not to join battle as yet, retired to Odollam, (C. 23:13, 1 Par. 11:15. C.) a *strong hold*, with which he was perfectly acquainted. H.  
**18** Raphaim*.* Sept. “of Titans,” C. or giants who had dwelt there. M.—It lay to the west ( M.) or south of Jerusalem, and extended as far as Bethlehem. David was still more to the south, ( C.) so that he seemed to be cut off from his capital. But it was secure enough. H.—On this occasion, three of his brave men went through the midst of the enemies’ ranks, to fetch water from the spring of Bethlehem. C. 23:16.  
**20** *Ba* *al-Pharisim*, “the master of the divisions *or* god of the scattered;” as the place was afterwards called, in memory that David became *master*, and put the enemy to flight, taking their *idols*, ( C.) which were unable to save themselves. H.  
**21** *Away*, and burnt. Par. The ark had on the contrary proved fatal to the gods, and to the people of the Philistines; who might hence perceive the difference there was between the true God and their false gods.  
**23** *Shall*, &c. This consultation is omitted in Heb. C.—Prot. “and when David inquired of the Lord, he said, “Thou shalt not,” &c. Sept. “and David,” &c. H.—*Trees.* Heb. Becaim. Sept. “of lamentation.” Judg. 2:1.  
**24** *Trees.* Many translate the Heb. “mulberry trees,” or leave the original word, becaim, “the heights of Bochim.” Sept. seem to give a double version: “the sound of the agitation (or Alex. “shutting up,” ( H.) as with an army on all sides) of the *woods*, of the *lamentation.*” M.—Theodoret supposes, “the woods put in motion, without any wind.” It is thought that an army of spirits went before David, and threw the enemy into a panic. Storms of hail, &c. seem to have also cut them down. Isai. 28:21, Ps. 17:9.  
**25** *Gabaa*, which some would understand of “the hills” of Bochim. C.—But in Sept. (Alex.) and in Par. we read *Gabaon*, a city near the birth-place of Saul. H.—David pursued the enemy by Gabaa, and took from them all the cities of which they had taken possession, after their victory. C.—*Gezer* was in the tribe of Ephraim, ( M.) on the confines of the Philistines. C.

## Chapter 6

**1** *Again*, after he had been anointed. David consulted his officers, &c. (1 Par. 13:1) and called a numerous assembly of the priests and people to meet him at Cariathiarim.—*Thousand*, in arms, to protect the rest, ( C.) who might probably amount to 300,000. H.—This number Capel and Grotius would substitute for the one here mentioned. Some copies of the Sept. read 70,000. In the former assembly, there were 340, or 359, ( C.) or 60 thousand. C. 5:1. H.  
**2** *Juda.* But why are not the other tribes mentioned? and whither did they go? We should probably translate, “from the city of Baalim, in Juda;” which is another name of Cariathiarim, as the Par. insinuate, v. 6. See Jos. 15:9, 60.—*Invoked;* or which is called “the ark of the Lord.”  
**3** *Cart*, out of respect, as the Philistines had done, 1 K. 6:7. But God had ordered the Levites to carry it themselves, and the neglect here proved so dreadful; for which reason, David required the priests to attend when he removed the ark from the house of Obededom, 1 Par. 15:12.—*Gabaa* means “the hill of Cariathiarim,” where the ark had been in the house of Abinadab, from the time of its being restored back by the Philistines. Ch.—Hunnius would multiply the places where the ark was fixed, to show, against Catholics, that the Church is not confined to one place; (Amama) as if Catholic did not maintain the universality of the Church! H.  
**5** *Wood.* Heb. specifies “fir wood,” of which the instruments were, perhaps, usually made.  
**6** *Nachon.* 1 Par. *Chidon.* Heb. may be rendered, “prepared;” (Chal.) as they were almost arrived at the end ( C.) of the procession.—*His hand*, is wanting in Heb. Kennicott.—*Kicked.* Prot. “shook it.” H.  
**7** *Rashness.* Heb. shal, means also “error, ignorance,” &c. Syr. and Arab. better, “because he put forth his hand.” Kennicott.—Oza had touched the ark uncovered, (Serarius) shewing too little confidence in God, as if he could not have hindered it from falling; (Rabbins) or perhaps he was the advisor of the ark’s being placed upon a cart, instead of the Levites’ shoulders. T.—It is not certain that he was a Levite; and the privilege belonged to the sons of Caath, who could claim this honour only after the ark had bee folded up with three covers. Moreover, the priests seem to have been always selected to carry the ark, after they came into the promised land, v. 3, 1 K. 4:4. &c. It is hoped that the fault of Oza would be expiated by his sudden death, ( C.) as his intention was laudable. T.—But God would teach his ministers with what caution they were to treat sacred things, ( C.) and how exactly all his injunctions were to be observed. H.  
**10** *Gethite*, a native of Geth-remmon, a Levitical city; (Jos. 21:24,) or he might have been born at Geth; ( C.) or his father might have resided there a long time, (Serar. T.) unless he was there with David. Salien.—He was a Levite, 1 Par. 15:18 and 16:5. and 26:4. C.  
**12** *Choirs.* Or companies of musicians. Ch.—This sentence is not found in Heb. nor in S. Jerom’s version. C.—The Vat. and Alex. Sept. have, “David brought the ark of the Lord from the house of Obeddara, into the city of David, with joy; (13) and there were seven choirs with him, taking up the ark, and the sacrifice, a calf and lamb; (14) and David played on tuneful organs before the Lord; and David had on a beautiful stole.” H.  
**13** *Paces.* So altars of turf (Grot.) were erected at this distance from each other, on each side of the road. The pagans have sometimes treated their emperors and deities with the like respect. Sueton. in Otho and Calig.—Paris thus addresses Helena in Ovid’s Heroic Epistles.  
**14** *Ephod* which ordinarily was the habit of priests. But no law restrained others from using it, ( C.) particularly on sacred occasions; as we often see laics in a surplice, when they have to sing Church music, &c. M.—David had also on a cloak of byssus; (Paral.) and still Michol speaks as if he had been uncovered; because in this solemn ceremony, he was inspired to divest himself of his royal robes, and to act with a degree of enthusiasm; ( H.) which would not have been otherwise becoming in a king. David is considered by some of the fathers as a figure of the priests of the new law; as he ate the loaves of proposition, was dressed like priests, &c. *Sacerdos scitus erat David* *.* 1 Iræn. iv. S. Amb. v. in Luc. vi. C.  
**16** *Leaping.* Sept. “beating” musical instruments … she counted him as nothing, &c. H.—She rather partook of her father’s disposition and pride. M.  
**18** *Blessed.* Wishing all sorts of happiness. Only priests and kings perform this function publicly, 3 K. 8:55. Afterwards David went to his palace, to impart the same blessing to his family, and particularly to the women, who had not been present. This is a vestige of the sacerdotal power, which masters of families formerly enjoyed.  
**19** *Cake*, made very thin, with a mixture of oil.—*Beef*, sufficient for a meal.—*Oil.* This was much esteemed in those days. Many would translate the Heb. “a bottle of wine.”  
**20** *Fellows.* Sept. “dancers.” Michol exaggerates, as David had been guilty of no indiscretion, v. 14. C.—S. Gregory (Mor. xxvii. 27,) styles her “insane.” Yet Abulensis does not sufficiently approve of David’s conduct. M.  
**22** *Eyes.* Humility in a king is truly noble.—*Glorious.* He accepts the compliment of Michol, though she had spoken ironically. H.  
**23** *Death.* Thus was she punished. The five sons who are attributed to her (C. 21:8) were only adopted; or perhaps we ought to read Merob, in stead of *Michol* *;* ( C.) as the latter had been connected with Phaltiel, and not with Adriel, who was the former’s husband. H.

## Chapter 7

**1** *Enemies*, before he had made war upon the surrounding nations. 1 Par. 18:1.  
**2** *Nathan.* An admirable courier, (Grot.) and a great saint, Eccli. 47. He was neither too rough, nor too complaisant.—*Cedar.* This was the most esteemed species of wood. The palace of the Persian kings, at Ecbatana, was chiefly built of it, and of cypress wood. Polyb. x.—Houses were not there built in such a solid manner, as they are in colder climates. They consisted mostly of wood.—*Skins.* The outer veils of the tabernacle were made of skins, as others generally were. C.—Heb. and Chal. “of curtains.”  
**3** *Thee.* David did not, perhaps, consult him as a prophet; and Nathan thought that the proposal was so just, that it might be safely carried into effect. The prophets are not inspired in all their actions. Joseph was of a different opinion from his father. Gen. 48:19. Samuel supposed that Eliab should have been king; (1 K. 16:6,) and Eliseus confesses, that God had concealed from his the affliction of the woman with whom he lodged. 4 K. 4:24. C.—God afterwards sent the same Nathan to rectify his former decision, that he might not pass sentence, in future, without consulting him. M.  
**7** **Ve** **r.** **7** **.** *Tribes.* 1 Paral. 17:6, by the substitution of *p* for *b*, reads *Shophete*, “judges,” which seems more natural. Some farther information is there given and we learn that the reason why David was denied the privilege of building a temple, was because he had been so much engaged in war. C.  
**10** *Before*, provided they be faithful. These promises are conditional.  
**11** *House*, or give thee children, who shall hold the sceptre. M.  
**12** *I will establish his kingdom.* This prophecy partly relates to Solomon; but much more to Christ, who is called the Son of David in Scripture, and the builder of the true temple, which is the Church, his everlasting kingdom, which shall never fail, nor be cast off for any iniquity of her children. Ch.—God passes over all the children whom David had already, 3 K. 2:15. The temporal kingdom was enjoyed by David’s posterity for a long time, sufficient to verify the expression *for ever*, as it is often used in Scripture. C.—But the spiritual kingdom of the Messias will last till the end of time, and be perfected in eternity. H.—In these predictions we must always distinguish the type from the reality. C.  
**14** *Men*, who are not to be entirely destroyed, like the Chanaanites. C.—This is not unlike the *human temptation* of which S. Paul speaks. 1 Cor. 10:13. See Ps. 72:5 and 88:33. H.—The *rod of men* denotes war, and *stripes* signify those punishments which God inflicts. S. Jer. Trad.—Some parts of this declaration regard Christ; others Solomon. Heb. 1:5. D.  
**16** *Faithful;* or continue a long time. M. 3 K. 11:38.—Where is not the house of David? or how is this accomplished, except in the Church?—*Thy face.* Sept. “before me,” which is conformable to Ps. 88:38. David saw Solomon on the throne, and beheld the Messias in spirit. C.—Souls departed still see what regards them, (Sa.) if they be happy. H.  
**18** *Lord.* “More in soul, than by this posture of the body, remaining quiet in meditation and prayer.” Cajet.—Vatable says only kings were allowed to pary sitting, (Sa. M.) and they must be of the house of Juda. Maimon.—they say the priests always stood in the temple. But Josephus mentions seats of lead for them. Bel. vii. 11. The Heb. expression may denote no more, than that David continued for a long time in fervent prayer; Josephus says, prostrate on the ground before the ark. It is not so much the posture of the body as the fervour of the soul, which God regards. See S. Aug. ad Simp. ii. q. 4. Pythagoras ordered his disciples to pray sitting; and Homer represents Thetis in that attitude. C.—*Far*, in power and glory. H.  
**19** **9** **.** *God.* Thus man wishes to be treated. This maxim prevails universally. People seek for their own and their children’s happiness; a favour which thou hast graciously promised unto me. C.—Thus immortality, and all happiness, were proposed unto the first man. M.—Some use an interrogation; “Is this the law of Adam?” C.—Prot. “manner of man.” Can this felicity attend a man in his fallen state? Does the greatest friend treat his companion with so much condescension and regard? H.—In 1 Par. 17:17, it is thus expressed, *and hast made me remarkable above all men, O Lord God.* Osiander translates, “Behold the law of man, of the Lord God.” I now discern the mysterious union of the godhead with our humanity, in the person of the Son. C.—Luther attributes this version, *Hæc est ratio hominis, qui Dominu* *s Deus est*, to Zisgler; and hence proves the incarnation. Amama and Tarnovius shew the weakness of the proof, though the article of faith be otherwise indubitable. H.—David is full of admiration that God should treat a weak mortal in such a manner. D.  
**20** *Unto thee.* To express his sentiments of gratitude. M.—What more can he desire?  
**21** *Word’s sake.* Some copies ( H.) of the Sept. read “servant’s sake,” as 1 Par. 17. C.  
**23** *A name.* So that all might praise God, for the favours which he had bestowed upon his people, ( H.) and admire his power and glory.—*Gods*, whom thou didst *cast ou* *t* of Chanaan. Par. C.—*From*, is not expressed in the Vulg. or Heb. though Prot. also supply it. H.—Some explain Elohim, “gods,” of the *chief* men of the Hebrew *nation.* The power of the idols was overthrown; (Num. 33:4,) and the Israelites were rescued both from oppression, and from the service of false gods. Ezec. 16. C.—Adonai is often substituted for Jehova; as appears from 1 Par. 17:21, 22. Kennicott.  
**25** *Raise up.* As long as the promises were not fulfilled, they seemed to be dormant. M.  
**27** *In his heart.* Lit. “has found his heart,” ( H.) following the inspirations of divine grace, to pray with attention and love, ( C.) and confidence. H.  
**29** *Begin.* Heb. “please, *or* deign to bless.” Sept. and Jonathan, “begin.” C.

## Chapter 8

**1** *Tribute.* Aquila, and probably S. Jerom, translated, “cubit.” Others suppose that *Amma*, or *Meteg-ama*, is some unknown place, which David wrested from the hands of the Philistines. It is hardly probable that the Israelites would have paid the latter tribute till the 20th year of his reign, ( C.) or even till the 12th. Salien.—He might now force them to pay tribute. S. Jerom, &c. H.—Perhaps a letter may have been transposed, and instead of Meteg, we should read, “*Geth*, the mother,” or metropolis, and its dependencies; (1 Par. 18:1) or “he took Metec, (Num. 33:28) and its mother,” Geth, which reconciles the two passages. Chald. &c. “he deprived them of the advantage of the rivulet.” Sept. “David took the separated” place, (Serar.) or the city of Geth. M.  
**2** *Earth*, like criminals condemned to die. Theodoret.—Some of them he chose to spare, and made tributary, having levelled the strong places with the ground. Den. the Carthusian.—Sept. intimate that half were destroyed. C.—But the Heb. rather implies that the greatest part was saved, “a full cord to save alive;” ( M.) unless there were three lots, and only one of them, larger indeed than the rest, spared. H.—Death, or slavery, were the portion of all who were taken in war. Grot. Jur. iii. 4. 20.—*Lex nulla capto parcit aut pœnam impendit* *.* Seneca.—*Tribute.* Heb. “brought gifts,” which is a softer term. The Moabites were thus punished for former and, probably, for some recent offences. H.  
**3** *Adarezer* *.* He is styled Adadezer in Heb. and this seems to have been his true name, though it is written Adarezer in Paral. Adad, or “the sun,” was the chief idol of Syria, and the kings inserted the name with their own; as Benadad did. Josephus produces a fragment from Nicholaus of Damascus, in which he says that “Adad was king of Damascus, and of all Syria, except Phœnicia, and was defeated by David … His successors took his name, as the kings of Egypt did that of Ptolemy; and that the third in descent from this king, made an attack upon Samaria,” and upon Achab. Ant. vii. 6.—*Euphrates*, which had been promised by God, Gen. 15:18, Num. 24:17. C.—Adadezer was probably the aggressor. Salien. M.  
**4** *A thous* *and.* Protestants supply *chariots*, ( H.) after the Sept. and 1 Par. (18:4) which have 7000 *horsemen.* See how we have attempted to reconcile these texts, 1 K. 13:5. Perhaps the numbers were expressed by single letters; and the Hebrew final n, (700) has been mistaken for *z*, (7000) both here and C. 10:18. *Literis numeralibus non verbis antiquitus numeri concipiebantur* *.* Scaliger, apud Walton prol.—“Will any other hypothesis so naturally solve this repeated difficulty?” Kennicott, Diss. on 1 Chron. xi p. 96 and 463.—Kimchi thinks that the king’s horse-guards are only specified here; and Salien supposes, that those who fought on chariots are also included in Chronicles, as they are often styled horsemen. Isai. 21:7, 9. M.—*Houghed.* Aquila, “destroyed.” He rendered them unfit for war, as Josue had don, (Jos. 11:6) supposing that this was the import of the decree, forbidding many horses to be kept, Deut. 17:16.—*Horses* is not expressed in Heb. though the Prot. supply the word; as also, *for.* We should translate lit. “He left out of them 100 chariots;” ( H.) as we read elsewhere, that Adarezer had 1000. M.—But this expression being unintelligible, no less than, “he houghed all the chariots,” as the text stands at present in the original, may lead us to suspect that this verse has been inaccurately printed. Sept. “David paralyzed, (or rendered useless) all the chariots; and 100 chariots were reserved for himself out of them.” Josephus says the rest of the 1000 chariots were burnt, 5000 horse slain, and 20,000 foot. H.  
**5** *Men.* As Adarezer had brought upon himself the arms of David, perhaps by attempting to succour the Moabites, as he afterwards did the children of Ammon; (C. 10) so the king of Damascus was ruined by coming too late to his assistance. This king may be the Adad mentioned by Nicholaus. B. 4. Salien, A. 2993, the 14th year of David. See v. 1 and 3.  
**7** *Arms.* “*Quivers.*” Paral. and Syr. “Bucklers.” Heb. and Chal. “Bracelets.” Sept. C.—These bucklers might be for ornament, like those of Solomon. 3 K. 10:16. Salien.—They were taken afterwards by Sesac, king of Egypt. Joseph. vii. 6. H.  
**8** *Beroth*, or Boroe. C.—*Brass.* All for the use of the temple. 1 Par. 18:8. The battle seems to have been fought near Beroth. Salien.  
**9** Emath, or Emesa. Its king, Thou, being alarmed at the ambition of his neighbour Adarezer, ( C.) was pleased with the victories of a prince from whom he thought he had less to fear, as the lived at a greater distance. H.  
**10** *Joram*, called Adoram in Chron. C.—*His*, Joram’s *hand.* M.  
**11** *Subdued.* This was the custom of most conquerors. But no prince was ever more religious in this respect than David. He had an officer appointed over the sacred treasure, which contained the presents of Samuel, Saul, &c. 1 Par. 26:26, 28.  
**13** *Name*, or triumphal arch. Rabbins.—He acquired great fame. C. 17:9, 1 Mac. 5:57. M.—*Syria*, which is styled *Aram* in Heb. The Sept. have read Edom, or Idumea, as the two names have often been confounded, on account of the similarity of the letters. The following verse seems favourable to this reading, as well as the title of the Ps. 59.; and 1 Par. 18:12, says, *Abisai … slew of the Edomites,* *in the valley of the salt-pits*, 18,000. It is probable that David was present. This Idumea was on the east of the Dead Sea, and had Bosra for its capital. The salt-pits might be a great plain, about three miles south of Palmyra or Thadmor, which supplies almost all Syria with salt. Brun. C.—Othes think that the borders of the most salt lake of Sodom are denoted. M. See Gen. 14:10.  
**14** *Guards*, or officers to administer justice in his name, after Joab had killed all the males, during six months. 3 K. 11:15. C.  
**15** *All Israel*, not only over Juda. M.—All the people who dwelt within the promised land, as far as the Euphrates, were forced to acknowledge his dominion. H.—*People*, settling their differences, &c. Kings formerly performed in person, the most important office of rendering justice; whence three kings of Crete are mentioned as judges in the realms below. C.—David acted with wisdom and justice. M.  
**16** *Sarvia*, sister of David. 1 Par. 2:16.—*Army.* Joab had acquired such influence over it, that his power was formidable even to David. He was a great warrior, and had contributed more than any other person to establish the throne of his uncle; but he was devoid of justice, and not much unlike Achilles.  
**17** *Achimelech* is also called the father of *Abiathar*, as these two had both names indiscriminately. 1 K. 21:2. During the contest between the families of Saul and of David, two high priests were acknowledged, in their respective dominions. Sadoc was also permitted to officiate at Gabaon, during the reign of David; and, as Abiathar took part against Solomon, he was invested with the whole authority, and thus were accomplished the predictions made to Phinees and to Heli. Num. 25:12, 1 K. 2:35. C.—Yet Salien considers Abiathar as the sole pontiff, from the time that his father was murdered by Saul. Sadoc, in the mean while, was his arch-priest or delegate, at Gabaon; ( H.) though Abulensis and Josephus acknowledge both as high priests, (1 Par. 24:3,) officiating by turns. M.—*Scribe*, or secretary. Ch. See Judg. 5:14.—Sept. “counsellor.” He is called Susa, in Chronicles. H.  
**18** *The Cerethi and Phelithi.* The king’s guards. Ch.—They were Philistines, and had attached themselves to David while he was at Geth, continuing always faithful to him. We read of them in the Vulgate, under the reign of Joas. 4 K. 11:19. David selected some out of all Israel, towards the end of his reign. 1 Par. 27.—*Princes:* literally, *priests;* (Cohen) so called, by a title of honour, and not for exercising the priestly function. Ch.—Sanctius translates, they “were like priests.” The book of 1 Par. 18:17,) explains, *were chief about the king.* Sept. “masters of the palace.” David kept them near his person, and employed them as he thought proper: Bertram thinks, in embassies, till after the revolt of Absalom, when Ira took their place. C. 20:26. C.—Prot. “David’s sons were chief rulers.” Chal. “grandees;” ( H.) “ministers.” Grot. D.

## Chapter 9

**1** *Saul.* David was solicitous only about the descendants of Jonathan, who was the eldest son. The rest he afterwards gave up to be crucified, while he ordered the patrimony of Saul to be given to Miphiboseth, who was now about twenty years old. Salien, A.C. 1058.—It is rather wonderful that David had not thought of his old friend sooner. But we are not obliged to suppose that he had reigned fifteen years, without being mindful of his repeated promises to Jonathan. 1 K. 20:42. H.—This event took place towards the beginning of his reign. C.  
**2** *Servant*, of free man of Saul, and a convert. Josephus. M.—Yet he might very well be a Hebrew, who refused to accept his liberty, and continued as superintendent over the rest of his master’s house, (v. 10,) like Eleazar, Joseph, (Gen. 24 and 39) or the servant of whom our Saviour speaks. Luke 12:42. C.  
**4** *Lodabar*, probably on the east side of the Jordan. C.—*Machir* was a powerful man of the tribe of Manasses. M.  
**7** *Fath* *er*, or grandfather. H.—It is thought that all his goods had been confiscated, in consequence of Isboseth’s assuming the regal dignity. C.—David might give the property to whom he pleased. M.—*Always.* This was a mark of the greatest distinction. Luke 22:30. The Romans sometimes made their slaves free, in this manner, *per mensam* *.* C.  
**9** *Son*, Miphiboseth. Some understand less correctly, ( C.) “I have given to Micha, the son of Miphiboseth, all that belonged to Saul; and, as for Miphiboseth, I give him my table.” Munster. Vatab. Salien. M.—Saul’s patrimony might be administered by Siba, to support Micha. D.  
**10** *Servants* under him, though all belonged to Miphiboseth. H.  
**11** *My table*, if the king was pleased so to order. Sanchez.—It would seem that Siba did not properly understand the king. C.—The Sept. Syr. and Arab. read, perhaps more correctly *u*, “his,” instead o *i*, “my table,” in *shulchani.* “And Memphibosthai ate at David’s table, as one,” &c. H.—He did not merely eat *of the* *king’s table*, (v. 13,) but at it, *super mensam*, as the Heb. Chal. and Sept. express. M.  
**13** *Feet*, from five years of age. C. 4:4. If we add the seven years and a half of his uncle’s reign, and suppose that David would take this notice of him, as soon as he had it in his power, after the taking of *Jerusalem*, we may conclude that he was about thirteen years old when he was presented to the king, and behaved with the most engaging modesty and respect. If he had already a son, (v. 12,) we may allow a few years more. H.

## Chapter 10

**2** *Naas*, whom Saul had defeated, and who on that account is supposed to have received his rival more willingly, ( C.) when he had retreated into the country of Moab. 1 K. 22:3. After receiving many presents from Naas, he retired to Odollam. S. Jer. Tradit. M.—Though the Israelites were not to seek the friendship of these nations, (Deut. 23:6,) they were not forbidden to make a return of gratitude. M.  
**3** *It.* Thus, by their insinuations, they pervert the good dispositions of their prince, and by too much policy bring ruin on the nation. H.—History affords many examples of similar effects of worldly wisdom. M.  
**4** *Away*, having forced them as it were to go into mourning for the deceased king. These nations adopted the same customs as the Hebrews: they cut their hair, and rent their garments, to express their deep affliction. Isai. 15:2. The Arabs would deem it a great insult, and a piece of irreligion, to shave their beard. Darvieux vii. p. 175. Plutarch (Agesil) observes, that the Lacedemonians obliged those who acted in a cowardly manner in war, to wear only one wisker: and Herodotus (ii. 121,) takes notice of a person who, in contempt, cut off the beard on the right cheeks of some soldiers, who were placed to guard the body of his brother, who had been gibbeted, having first made them drunk, that he might take away the body. The *garments* (Aquila says, “the tunic,” Sept. “the cloak, *or* mandua,” which is a military garment used in Persia) were cut ( C.) for the same purpose, like our spencers, ( H.) that the ambassadors might be exposed to derision, as breeches were not usually worn, ( C.) except by priests officiating. D.—This was in contempt of circumcision. M.—Yet we cannot suppose, but that the ambassadors would procure something to cover themselves before they arrived at Jericho, where they remained till their beard and the hair of their head (1 Par. 19) were grown. The city was not rebuilt, but there were some houses in the territory of that devoted place. Jos. 6:26. H.  
**6** *Rohob*, the capital, between Libanus and Antibanus.—*Soba* was subject to Adarezer. C. 8:3.—*Maacha*, at the foot of Hermon.—Istob (Heb. ish tob) signifies, the man, or prince, or “the master of Tob,” ( C.) where Jephte lived. Judg. 11:5. D. Salien.—Josephus thinks that Istob is the name of a fourth king, who, together with the king of Micha, brought 22,000 into the field. The first he styles king “of the Mesopotamians,” (1 Par. 19:6) which Salien explains of the country between Abana and Pharphar, the two great rivers of Syria, (4 K. 5:12,) though, on this occasion, he allows that Adarezer hired forces from the utmost parts beyond the Euphrates. H.  
**7** *Warriors.* The outrage offered to the ambassadors was a sufficient reason. The king of Ammon might have refused to receive them; but he could not, with any propriety, treat them with scorn. “The right of ambassadors has both a divine and human sanction.” Cicero, c. Verrem 3.—The Romans have frequently waged war to revenge such wrongs. Grot. Jur. ii. 18.  
**8** Ammon*.* David was disposed to have lived in peace with this nation: but they voluntarily provoked his arms, after he had made such havoc upon all the neighbouring idolaters, and thus draw down the scourge of Providence; who suffers those to be blinded whom he has resolved to punish. The preparations for this war seem to have been greater than usual, and it continued for a longer period, and in the end proved destructive to all. H.—*Gate* of Medaba. Paral. Besides the 33,000 auxiliaries (v. 6) and the natives, 32,000 chariots of war were hired from beyond the Euphrates. 1 Par. 19:7.  
**12** *City*, Jerusalem, the metropolis; or, all *the cities* of Israel. Paral.  
**15** *Together*, expecting that David would punish them farther. M.  
**17** *Helam.* Ptolemy mentions *Alamata*, on the Euphrates. But perhaps we ought to read the Heb. Lehem, “he came upon them.” See 1 Par. 19:17. Some translate, “he came to their army.”  
**18** *Hundred.* Paral. *thousand*, allowing ten men for each chariot. D. M.—*The men* is omitted in both texts. See C. 8:4. H.—*Horsemen.* Paral. reads, *footmen*, supplying what is here omitted, (Salien) so that 87,000 Syrians perished, unless there be a mistake of the transcribers. C.—*Smote*, though not perhaps with his own hand, as he slew so many thousands by means of his army. M.  
**19** *Before Israel.* Heb. and Sept. only read, “And when all the kings, servants of Adarezer, saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them,” &c. H.—The addition is not found in the ancient version of S. Jerom. These tributary kings lived in Syria, and some perhaps beyond the Euphrates. See Ps. 59. C.—The army had consisted of 145,000 men. After the loss of 87,000, the *servants of Adarezer we* *nt over to David, and served him.* Paral. M.

## Chapter 11

**1** *Year.* Heb. “at the end of the year,” (Chal. Syr.) which may be explained either of the year after the preceding engagement, or at the end of the civil year, in the autumnal equinox, ( C.) or of the sacred year, which begins in the spring, ( H.) when kings more commonly go to battle, about the month of March. M.—In hot countries they make a campaign also in autumn.—Ammon*.* They had not been sufficiently chastised, as they had saved themselves within their strong cities. They had added to their other crimes, that of stirring up the Syrians against David. C.—Rabba, the capital of Ammon, which Polybius calls “Rabatamana.” See C. 5:8. H.  
**2** *Noon.* He had been reposing, according to custom. C. 4:7. C.—But the devil was not idle. He was meditating a temptation and crime, which involved a great part of the remainder of David’s life in misery. H.—He had reigned 18 years, and lived 48, almost without blame. Salien, A. 2998.—*His house*, as the Heb. explains it. The Vulg. *might* insinuate that the woman was upon “the roof of her house.” But she was probably in her garden, as the Jews have their baths in the open air. They are frequently obliged to purify themselves. C.—The house must have been very near David’s palace. Salien.  
**3** *Eliam.* By a transposition of letters, he is called Ammiel, in 1 Par. 3:5. Both words signify “my people is God’s.” This son of Achitophel (C. 23:34,) was one of David’s valiant men, as well as Urias, who is styled *the Hethite*, being born at Eth; (S. Jer. Salien) or on account of his extraction, or because he or his ancestors ( H.) had performed some great exploit against that nation; as Germanicus, Africanus, &c. received those titles among the Romans, for conquering the Germans, &c. C.—Eth was a place near Hebron. Adric. 128. M.—The name of Bethsabee is also different in Paral.; the last *b* in Heb. being changed into *v.* Both-shua, both-al-i-am; instead of *Both-shoba, both-am-i-al.* H. Kennic.—The grandfather of Bethsabee is supposed to have revolted against David, to revenge the wrong done to her. T. A. Lapide. “Let the weak tremble at the fall of the strong.” S. Aug. in Ps. l.  
**4** *Purified.* Lit. “sanctified.” Heb. and Sept. “for she was,” &c. H.—*Hoc ideo additum ne miraremur illico eam concepisse* *.* Grot. Arist. Anim. vii. 20.—Women were obliged to bathe after such actions. Lev. 15:18.  
**8** *Feet.* As they did not wear stockings, this practice was very common after a journey. David thus insinuated that Urias might take his rest, and go to his wife, that so he might suppose that the child was his own, and the crime of Bethsabee might be concealed. C.—*King*, as a mark of honour, but in reality that he might be more excited to indulge his pleasures. Abulensis. M.  
**9** *House*, in the court, for the guards. See Athen. v. 2. &c.  
**10** *Journey*, of thirty hours’ length. Adrichomius.  
**11** *Ark.* Most people suppose that the ark and the priests were before Rabba, as they seem to have been present in all expeditions of consequence. M. C.—but, at any rate, the ark was covered with skins or veils, even in the tabernacle at Gabaon, or at Sion. H.—*Thing.* He binds himself by an oath not to gratify his natural inclinations, that the king might desist from pressing him any farther. Salien.—But David resolves to endeavour to make him forget his oath, during the moments of intoxication. The valour and temperance of Urias, and divine Providence, render all his craft useless; and a concatenation of crimes cannot hide the original offence. H.  
**13** *Couch.* It seems he was one of the guards. Josephus says he was Joab’s armour-bearer, (Ant. vii. 7.) and one of David’s heroes. C. 23:39.  
**14** *Morning* of the fourth day, as Urias staid three nights at Jerusalem. It is not clear that he was intoxicated the last of them. On that night David permitted him to act as he should think proper; and finding that he obstinately persisted in the resolution of not going to sleep with his wife, he had recourse to the last and most barbarous expedient of making way for his own marriage with the woman, as he saw this was the only method left for him to save her honour. The utmost expedition was requisition, as many days must have elapsed before she perceived her situation; ( H.) and if many more should pass over, it would be manifest to the world that she had been guilty of adultery, and must either be stoned, or, if David spared her, he must bear the blame. Salien.—*Urias* *.* The fable of Bellerophon being sent by Prœtus to Jobates, king of Syria, with a letter, desiring the king to put the bearer to death, seems to have been copied from this history. Their letters have become proverbial. Chry.  
**15** *Die.* We no longer behold the genius of that David who would not hurt his persecutor. What a change does a shameful passion introduce in the whole conduct of a man! and how does one false step conduct from one abyss to another! *Proprium humani ingenii est odisse quem læseris* *.* Tacit.—David could no longer bear the sight of a man whom he had injured so grievously. C.  
**17** *Also.* Hence David prays with reason; Deliver me from blood (*sanguinibus*) of many slain. He was answerable for all Cajetan.  
**21** *Jerobaal?* Hebrews write Jeroboseth, to avoid the mention of Baal, as they also do with respect to the name of Isboseth, who was probably called Isbaal. C. See Judg. 9:57.—Joab supposed that David might probably adduce this instance, to shew the danger of approaching too near the wall, as it had proved destructive to part of his army, and had been fatal to Abimelech. But it seems the messenger did not allow him time to express any resentment, before he told him the agreeable news, which he desired so much to hear, v. 24. H.  
**26** *For him.* We may apply to her tears those words of Lucan:  
**27** *Lord;* not that David had married the woman, but on account of his former conduct towards her and her husband. M.—The canon law forbids the marriages of those who have been accomplices in the death of their former partner; and some have thought that this marriage of David was null. But this is inaccurate; and the fruits of it were ( C.) all deeded legitimate. See 1 Par. 3:5. H.—The Rabbins even pretend that David was guilty of no sin in marrying Bethsabee during the life-time of Urias; as the latter, they say, must have given her a bill of divorce when he went to war. Grotius.—But why should we excuse an action which was so severely condemned and punished by God? C. 12:1. &c. Ps. 1. C.—In David’s conduct, we here behold a complication of the basest passions of lust and cruelty; which make David neglect the sanctity of an oath, (v. 11) and attempt to ruin, by drunkenness, the soul of one to whom he was much indebted; and, afterwards, to expose him to an untimely death, perhaps without repentance; if indeed Urias exceeded the bounds of moderation. This however is not certain; as the word *drunk* is often used to denote a degree of blameless conviviality. Gen. 43:34. Yet the design of David was equally criminal. How soon may the man *according to God’s own heart*, fall from his elevated station into the depth of the abyss! *Wherefore let him that* *thinketh himself to stand, take heed lest he fall.* 1 Cor. 10:12. H.

## Chapter 12

**1** *Unto him*, after the birth of the child. A whole year had nearly elapsed, and David continued blind and impenitent. The spirit of prophecy had left him; and, though he was clear-sighted, and equitable enough to punish the faults of others, he could not discern his own picture, till Nathan had removed the veil. The prophet acted with the utmost prudence, and did not condemn the king till he had pronounced sentence on himself. It is commonly supposed that the interview was private. S. Chrysostom believes that the chief lords of the court were present; which would enhance the discretion of Nathan, as well as David’s humility. C.  
**3** *Daughter.* All these expressions tended to shew the affection of the owner for this pet lamb. H.—In Arabia, one of the finest is commonly fed in the house along with the children. Bochart, Anim. T. i. B. ii. 46.—It is not necessary that every word of this parable should have been verified in Bethsabee. C.—Many things are usually added for ornament. M.—Yet she had been treated in the most tender manner by her husband, who had her alone, while David had eighteen wives. H.  
**4** *To him.* This wanton cruelty caused David to pronounce him deserving of death; as simple theft was punished with only a four-fold restitution. Ex. 22:1. Judges sometimes diminish, and at other times increase, the severity of the law, according to the dispositions of the offenders, which lawgivers could not exactly foresee. C.  
**6** *Fold.* Sept. “seven-fold,” which Grabe corrects by the Heb. H.—David lost four of his sons; the first born of Bethsabee, Amnon, Absalon, and Adonias: and saw his daughter Thamar, ( C.) and his ten inferior wives, dishonoured, in punishment of his crime. M.  
**7** *The man*, against whom thou hast pronounced sentence, and who has treated thy neighbour with still less pity. H.  
**8** *Wives.* We know of none that David married. But, as king, he enjoyed alone that privilege. Grot. C. 2:7. and 16:21.—*Unto thee.* Heb. “I would have given thee such and such.” C.—Sept. “I will moreover give thee like unto these;” a continuation of prosperity. H.—This singular love, which God was still disposed to manifest unto David, touched his heart with peculiar force. Salien.  
**10** *House.* What a dismal scene opens itself to our view during the remaining part of David’s reign! H.—Scarcely one of his successors was free from war; even Solomon was disturbed by the rebellion of Jeroboam, &c. and many of David’s family and descendants came to an untimely end, v. 6. C.—Six sons of Josaphat, all Joram’s, except one, Josias, the children of Sedecias, &c. 4 K. 25. &c. W.  
**11** *I will raise*, &c. All these evils, inasmuch as they were *punishments*, came upon Daivd by a just judgment of God, for his sin; and therefore God says, *I will raise*, &c. But inas much as they were *sins*, on the part of Absalom and his associates, God was not the author of them, but only permitted them. Ch.—God permitted the wicked prince to succeed for some time, that he might punish David. C.—*Neighbour*, most dearly beloved. To be treated ill by such a one, is doubly severe. Ps. 54:15. M.  
**12** *Sun*, publicly. C. 16:22. How abominable soever this conduct of an unnatural son must have been to God, he says, *I will do this;* because, when he might have prevented it by a more powerful grace, or by the death of the delinquent, he suffered him to carry his infernal project into execution. H.  
**13** *Sinned.* His confession was sincere, and very different from that of Saul, 1 K. 15:24. “The expression was the same; but God saw the difference of the heart.” S. Aug. con. Faust. xxii. 27.—*Sin.* He has remitted the fault and the eternal punishment, and he has greatly diminished the temporal chastisement, and will not inflict instant death, as he seemed to have threatened, v. 10. C.—“The speedy remission shewed the greatness of the king’s repentance.” S. Amb. Apol. 2.  
**14** *Occasion.* Lit. “made” almost, in the same sense, as God threatened to do, what was effected by Absalom, v. 12. David did not co-operate with the malice of infidels; but he was responsible for it: in as much as he had committed an unlawful action, which gave them occasion to blaspheme God, as if he had not been able to foresee this scandalous transaction. Thus God and religion are often vilified, on account of the misconduct of those who have the happiness to be well informed, but do not live up to their profession: but this mode of argumentation is very fallacious and uncandid. It ought, however, to be a caution to the servants of the true God, never to do any thing which may have such fatal consequences; and alienate the minds of weak men for the truth.—*Die.* Thus infidels would see, that God did not suffer David to pass quite unpunished. H.  
**15** *Of.* Heb. “it was sick” ( C.) of a fever.  
**16** *A fast*, (*jejunavit jejunio*) denotes, with more than ordinary rigour. Salien.—*By himself.* Heb. “he went in, and lay all night upon the ground.” H.  
**18** *Day.* After his birth, when he had received circumcision; (Salien) or on the 7th day since the commencement of his malady. C. M.  
**23** *To me.* No instance of any one being raised from the dead had yet occurred; though David did not disbelieve its possibility. M.  
**24** *Wife.* She had partaken in his affliction and repentance. The Jews say that David told her the divine oracle, which is mentioned 3 K. 1:13, 17, that her next son should succeed to the throne. Salien ( A. 3000) supposes that he was conceived in May, two months after the death of Bethsabee’s first-born, and came into the world about he time of the Passover.—*Solomon*, “the pacific.” See 1 Par. 22:9. M.  
**25** *Amiable to the Lord.* Or beloved of the Lord. In Hebrew, *Yedideya.* Ch.—*Loved him*, is not expressed in Heb. “because of the Lord.” H.—Theodotion, “in the word, or agreeably to, the order of the Lord.” Solomon never went by the name which God here gives him, ( C.) except in this place. M.—It shews the gratuitous predilection which God had for him; but affords no proof of his predestination to glory, of which there is too much reason to doubt. C.  
**27** *The city of waters.* Rabbath, the royal city of the Ammonites, was called *the city of waters*, from being encompassed with waters. Ch. See C. 5:8.—The Heb. in the preceding verse seems to insinuate, ( H.) that “he had taken the royal city.” But he was only on the point of doing it, or had, perhaps, made himself master of some part of it. Here the Heb. “I have taken,” may be explained in the same sense, unless *the city of wate* *rs* were the lower part of Rabbath, lying on the Jaboc. Junius translates, “He cut off the waters, which entered the city;” and Josephus favours this explanation. It seems the siege lasted about two years. C.—Antiochus took this city, by depriving the inhabitants of water. Polyb. v.  
**28** *Take it.* The higher, and more impregnable part; which honour Joab reserved for David.  
**30** *King.* Heb. Malcam, “their king.” Moloc, “king,” or the chief idol of the Ammonites. It was forbidden to use the ornaments of the idols on Chanaan, but not of other nations. This crown might be worth a talent, on account of the gold and precious stones; (1 Par. 20:2. Sanchez. Bochart,) or it might weigh so much as almost 87 pounds, ( C.) or above 113 pounds English. H.—such immence crowns were sometimes suspended for ornament, over the throne; as Benjamin of Tudela says was done by the emperor Commenes. Pliny describes one of nine pounds; and Athenæus (v. 8,) another of 80 cubits, or 40 yards ( H.) in circumference. C.—The idol, or the king of Ammon, ( M.) might have one of the like nature, suspended. The Rabbins say David caused it to hand in the air by means of a load-stone; as if it would attract gold! C.  
**31** *Sawed.* Heb. “he put *them* under saws, and under rollers of iron, and under knives,” &c. H.—The Jews say that Isaias was killed by being sawed asunder; to which punishment S. Paul alludes. Heb. 11:37. M.—*Brick-kilns*, or furnaces. Ps. 20:10. Muis.—David and his companions were thrown into the fiery furnace. Dan. 3:6, 11, Est. 13:7. C.—Some condemn David of excessive cruelty on this occasion. T. Sanctius.—But the Scripture represents his conduct as irreproachable, except in the affair of Urias; (3 K. 15:5,) and at this distance of time, we know not the motives which might have actuated him to treat his enemy with such severity. The Ammonites had probably exercised similar cruelties on his subjects. See 1 K. 11:2, Amos 1:13. C.—They had shamefully violated the law of nations, and had stirred up various kings against David. M.—Salien blames Joab for what may seem too cruel. But, though he was barbarous and vindictive, we need not condemn him on this occasion, no more than his master; as we are not to judge of former times by our own manners. H.—War was then carried on with great cruelty. C.

## Chapter 13

**1** *Thamar* was born of Maacha, as well as Absalom.  
**2** *Her.* He had seen her on some solemn occasions, when virgins were allowed to go out, well attended. At other times they were so strictly guarded, that Amnon thought it almost impossible to gratify his passion, ( C.) which made him grow pale. He afterwards feigned himself to be more sickly than he really was, v. 6. H.  
**3** *A* *very wise man.* That is, a crafty and subtle man: for the counsel he gave on this occasion shews that his wisdom was but carnal and worldly. Ch.—Jonadab seems to be styled Jonathan, C. 21:21. C.  
**4** *King?* to whom every indulgence must be allowed. M.  
**5** *To me.* Heb. “and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see *it*, and eat *it*,” &c. H.—He pretends to be disgusted with food, ( C.) unless he see his sister make it ready. H.  
**6** *Messes.* Heb. “cakes, *or* cordials;” what which refresh the heart, and give an appetite. The queen of Perdiccas, of Macedon, baked bread for her servants. Herod. viii. 137. Gen. 18:6.  
**9** *Out.* This conveys the idea of something liquid. C.—It was a thin wafer, ( H.) or cake, of which there were different sorts.  
**10** *Chamber.* Heb. Chadera, “bed-place,” (Cant. 1:4) where Amnon was lying. C.  
**12** *Folly*, or impiety, so directly contrary to the law. Levit. 18:6 and 9 and 11. H.  
**13** *Thee.* Was she ignorant that such marriages could not be allowed? C.—Some think she was. Grot. M.—Others believe that, in her present situation, she said what first came into her head, to get out of the hands of her brother. The Rabbins pretend that she was conceived before David married her mother, and that the latter was a pagan; so that they suppose there was no relationship between Thamar and Amnon. But this is all asserted without proof. C.  
**15** *Before.* Such changes are not unfrequent in those who give way to disordered passions, as Aristotle (prob. iv.) proves. Semiramis slew her lovers, and among the rest her own son. T.—God caused Amnon to be stung with remorse, and the evil spirit pushed him on to extremities, which filled the palace with scandal and bloodshed. M.  
**16** *Greater*, as being more public; ( T.) and all would think her guilty of some horrible misdemeanor. H.—It made the divulging of the crime in some degree necessary. M.—Unhappy woman! why did she not cry out, at least, before the perpetration of the act, as the law directed? Deut. 22:24. Salien, A. 3000.  
**18** *Robe.* Heb. passim*;* long and variegated, like Joseph’s. Gen. 37:3. The Sept. call it, καρπωτος, to insinuate that it was “adorned with fruits,” &c. H.  
**19** *Head*, as if to hide her face. Ezec. 27:30, Jer. 2:37. So Mezentius:  
**20** *Brother.* His disgrace will fall upon the whole royal family, and the king will not bring him to punishment, like another. C.—*Away.* Heb. and Chal. “desolate.” M.—Sept. “like a widow.”  
**21** *And he*, &c. This is not in Heb. &c. nor in S. Jerom’s version. Josephus and some copies of the Sept. read it. But the reason here alleged would not suffice to excuse David. C.—He might think that, as he had shewn such a bad example himself, he could not with a good grace punish others. Sanctius.—This however was requisite, as long as he was king. Whatever faults he might have fallen into, he was not on that account to suffer crimes to remain unpunished; ( H.) and it is supposed that he testified his resentment to Amnon; (Salien, &c.) though the Scripture be silent thereon. H.—Abulensis condemns him for too great remissness. M.  
**23** *Two.* Heb. “full years.” He waited so long, that he might put his murderous designs in execution with less suspicion. H.—*Sheep.* It was esteemed the best husbandry, “to have fine flocks;” *be* *ne pascere* *:* (Cato) even for the nobility.—*Ephraim*, or Ephrem; (Jo. 11:54) probably near Bethel. Joseph. Bel. v. 33. C.—Nabal had made a feast on a similar occasion. 1 K. 25. Absalom invites his father to avoid suspicion; ( M.) though he would be glad at his refusing to come, unless perhaps he would not have hesitated to order his brother to be murdered in his very presence, in order to punish both. H.  
**25** *Blessed him*, wishing him joy. Absalom kept a separate establishment, and had many children. C. 14:27. M.  
**26** *Amnon.* He mentions him as the eldest, and that David might suppose that they were perfectly reconciled. C.—The unhappy father seems for a long time to have expressed a reluctance and foreboding. H.  
**28** *It is I:* the blame will fall on me; I will rescue all from danger. These servants were probably infidels, of Gessur, and fled with their master. M.  
**29** *Mule.* This is the first time we find these animals used to ride on. The judges had fair asses. These mules were not the offspring of horses and asses. They bear young in Syria, (Aristot. anim. vi. 24.) and are little inferior to horses in size, though they are shaped like our mules. Ibid. c. xxxvi.  
**30** *Left.* Fame often magnifies. M.—*Crescit eundo* *.* H.  
**32** *Mouth.* Chal. Syr. “heart.” Aquila, “because Absalom was in wrath against him.” He had resolved upon his destruction. C.—Perhaps he had expressed his intention to some of the court; and this Jonadab (by whose means the crime had been committed, v. 5) had heard of it. H.  
**34** *Mountain.* Olivet. C.—They had not kept the high road through fear of Absalom; (Abul.) who, on his part, fled out of the country, as no city of refuge was able to protect wilful murderers. H.  
**37** *Tholomai*, or Tholmai, ( H. C. 3:3) his maternal grandfather. C.  
**38** *Ceased.* We do not read that he had pursued Absalom before. C.—Now he laid aside all thoughts of punishing him, as he began even to desire to see him again, when he reflected that Amnon had deserved death. H.—Heb. also, “he burnt with a secret desire to receive Absalom.” C. 14:1. Jonathan. Vatab. &c. C.—Prot. “*the soul of* king David longed to go forth unto,” &c. H.

## Chapter 14

**2** *Thecua*, twelve miles south of Jerusalem. S. Jer.—Joab causes this unknown woman to come from the country to conceal his design, ( C.) hoping that Absalom would be his father’s successor. M.  
**4** *Save me.* So the Jews frequently repeated Hosanna; and David addressed God, *save us.* 1 Par. 16:35. T.  
**5** *Dead.* Some conclude from v. 16, that this is a true history; but it appears rather, that it was only a parable, (v. 19. C.) invented by Joab. M.  
**7** *Heir.* She expresses their sentiments more than their words. C.—Some of the relations might desire to obtain the inheritance. M.—See Num. 35:18.—*Spark.* Posterity is often denoted by a lamp. C. 21:17. Heb. and Sept. “my coal,” reserved to enkindle my fire, ( C.) or to perpetuate our *name* in Israel, ( H.) or that of his father, to whose title the son succeeded. The mother could claim no inheritance. M.  
**9** *Guiltless*, if the murderer be not brought to execution. I am willing to bear all the blame and punishment. C.—Abigail and Rebecca speak in the same manner. 1 K. 25:24, Gen. 27:13. T.—Though kings may not pardon as they please, yet in this instance David might protect the widow’s son, as there was no witness to prove that he had committed the murder. M.—The woman was not satisfied with the former promise. She wished to extort something more decisive. She intimates that the danger is pressing, and if any misfortune should arrive, she cannot impute it to the king, ( C.) which gives him occasion to encourage her the more. H.  
**11** *Multiplied*, or overwhelm me with their numbers. C.  
**13** *Exile*, the banished Absalom, ( H.) who, in similar circumstances, has only committed a crime like that which the king is willing to pardon at the entreaty of a poor widow; though all the people of God seem interested for the welfare of Absalom, whom they look upon as the heir apparent. This was the drift of the whole parable. C.—*To sin*, may be referred to Absalom, who might be driven by despair to worship idols. M.  
**14** *Earth;* so great was the distress of the people at the absence of their darling prince. H.—His death would not bring Amnon to life again. We must not cherish sentiments of eternal enmity.—*Pe* *rish.* Chal. “a just judge cannot take the money of iniquity.” Le Clerc, “And cannot the prince (or judge) pardon a man, and devise means to leave his son no longer in exile?” C.—Prot. “neither doth God respect *any* person; yet doth he devise means, that his banished son be not expelled from him.” Let the king imitate this example. H.  
**15** *Before the people.* Heb. also, “through fear, *or* respect for the people,” who generally wished that Absalom might return. H.—Joab was present, (v. 21) and no doubt many others; who, if requisite, might join their prayers with hers. C.  
**16** *Me.* She identifies her cause with that of her son, as if she could not survive his death; or, at least, could not retain the *inheritance*, if he should perish. H.  
**17** *Sacrifice;* perfect and inviolable. T.—*Curs* *ing*, provided he be in the right. M.—Heb. “the king to discern (hear) good and bad;” of consummate wisdom; (v. 20. H.) so that no one can impose upon him.  
**19** *Right*, but he hath ordered me to say all these things. Joab had given her leave to make this declaration, as he perceived that the king’s heart was already inclined towards Absalom, v. 1. M.  
**21** *Boy.* This expression might tend to excuse what he had done amiss; as it shewed also the tenderness of David for Absalom. M.  
**22** *Blessed.* That is, praised, and gave thanks to the king.  
**24** *Face*, though he lived in Jerusalem. C.—This was done, in order that he might enter seriously into himself, and avoid similar excesses. M.—He felt this privation more than exile. H.  
**26** *A year.* Heb. and Sept. “from the end of the days to days.”—Chal. “as it was convenient.” But the Vulg. seems the best, ( C.) and is followed by the Prot. version. H.—*Sicles*, including all his hair. The Hebrews wore their hair very long. It does not commonly grow above four inches in a year; so that the hair which was cut off could not weigh 200 sicles. C.—*Weight.* Heb. “after the king’s stone,” *Beeben;* but one MS. has *Boshkol*, with the Sept. “after the king’s sicle (Ken.) weight,” at Babylon, as Pelletier supposes that this work was written towards the end of the captivity. He allows that Absalom’s hair might weigh almost 31 ounces. Some women wear above 32 ounces, if we may believe the hair-dressers. Some suppose that *r* (200) has been substituted instead of *d* (4) or *c*, (20) &c. But all are not convinced that the Hebrew formerly marked the numbers by letters. Sept. have, “100 sicles,” ( C.) which some attempt to reconcile with the common reading, by saying, that they speak of the sicles of the sanctuary, which were double the weight of the king’s sicles. Yet the Alex. and Vat. copies agree with the Vulgate: ( H.) and of this distinction of weights there is no proof. The Rabbins assert that the value, and not the weight, of Absalom’s hair is given; ( C.) and that he made a present of his hair to some of his friends, who sold it to the ladies of Jerusalem, to adorn their heads. Sanctius.—Tirin adopts this sentiment, and ridicules those who say that the weight is meant; as he says, 200 sicles would be equivalent to 8¾ Roman pounds, which comes near to Arbuthnot’s calculation in English. H.—Bochart reduces the weight to four such pounds, each consisting of twelve ounces; and he supposes that the hair was so heavy, on account of the gold dust with which it was covered, according to the fashion of those times. Joseph. viii. 1.—But this weight would be only accidental. C.—Josephus (vii. 8.) intimates, that Absalom’s hair was “cut every eight days,” or “for the space of eight days.” It is quite incredible that it should weigh 200 sicles, or five minæ of Alexandria, each consisting of twelve ounces. The Latin interpreter reads, “every eight months.” C.—S. Epiphanius and Hero have 125 sicles, or about 31 ounces. H.—The Babylonian sicle, here mentioned, was only the third part of that used by the Hebrews. D.  
**27** *Sons*, who all died before their father. C. 18:18.—*Thamar*, in memory of his sister; (Abul.) or this Thamar received the name from her aunt, who resided with Absalom. M.—Some Greek and Latin copies add, that she was married to Roboam, the son of Solomon, by whom he had Abias. But this addition is of no authority, and can hardly be reconciled with chronology. We read that Roboam espoused Maaca, the daughter of Absalom; (2 Par. 11:20) but she might be only his grand-daughter, by Thamar. C.—Josephus had adopted this addition. H.  
**29** *To him.* Joab, like a crafty courtier, would neither disoblige the king nor the prince, and therefore wished not to meddle in this affair; as he might either excite the suspicions of the own, or the resentment of the other. C.  
**33** *Kissed Absalom*, and thus was reconciled to his prodigal son. Luke 15:20. The ungrateful wretch only took occasion, from his father’s goodness, to alienate the minds of the people from him, by insinuating that he neglected the welfare of the people. H.

## Chapter 15

**1** *Before him.* Romulus instituted the 300 guards, whom he called *Celeres*, for the like purpose. C.—Absalom’s ambition could not wait patiently for the death of his father, who was not yet sixty years old, and had been first anointed forty years before, v. 7. He looked upon himself as the heir apparent, Amnon being now slain, and Cheliab (or Daniel) either dead, as it is thought, or unfit for government, while Solomon was only eight years old. Salien.—The quality of his mother, and his own personal qualifications, made him despise his brethren, and he began to assume the equipage of a king. C.—David considered this as only the effect of juvenile vanity, and he had not a mind to irritate him, without the utmost necessity. Salien.—Heb. “Absalom prepared for himself a chariot, (Prot. chariots) and horses,” &c. H.—It is not certain whether he had any other horsemen but those who mounted the chariots. Horses were then very scarce in Israel. C.—Adonias afterwards imitated his brother’s ambition, during his father’s life; (3 K. 1:5) so that *evil* was continually raised up against David, out of his *own house.* C. 12:11.  
**2** *Israel.* Absalom rises early for wickedness. He assumes the character of a more zealous and disinterested judge, as if to contrast his conduct with the remissness of some appointed by the king; though the Holy Ghost bears witness to the integrity of David. C. 8:15. Who would not be deceived by such appearances, if the arts of hypocrites had not taught us to examine things to the bottom, and to be upon our guard? *If thy eye be evil, thy whole body* *will be darksome.* The intention decides all. H.  
**5** *Kissed him.* Engaging affability! How often abused by the ambitious, for similar purposes! H.—Thus acted Otho. *Protendens manum, adorare vulgus,* *jacere oscula et omnia serviliter pro dominatione* *.* Tacit. Hist. i.—“Stretching out his hand, he bowed to the common people, dispensing his kisses at random, and performed all the acts of servility to obtain the throne.” H.  
**6** *Enticed.* Heb. “stole.” The people were not aware of his designs. C.—Absalom rendered them dissatisfied with the present government, and led them to expect better days, under his administration. H.  
**7** *Forty*, which Vatable dates from the time when the people petitioned for a king; Salien, from the first anointing of David. M.—It is probable enough that this number has been substituted instead of *four*, which Josephus, Theodoret, Syr. Arab. and many Latin MSS. read; and Absalom would employ this term in securing the interest of Israel, before he declared himself openly their king. C.—He had been so long at Jerusalem, since his return. Salien.—The canon of Heb. verity, supposed to be made about the ninth century, is said (by Martinnay. H.) to be altered by some correcting hand, from four to forty. Kennicott.—This is the famous Memmian canon, which Theodulph, bishop of Orleans, is believed to have ordered, as the standard of truth, according to the Hebrew copies of that day: (17. The Vulgate of Sixtus V. in that passage, as well as in the present, reads the smaller numbers, as he was guided by the best *Latin* copies, whereas Clement VIII. has also consulted “the Heb. fountains.” The former, says Kennicott, (Diss. ii. p. 205) “seems to have been printed on a juster plan … and the old Latin version is likely to be found more pure in the edition of Sixtus than in that of Clement, since the latter seems to have corrected his Latin by the modern (i.e. the corrupted) Heb. copies.” Dr. James observes, that “almost all the Latin editions received in the Church, for many years, (preceding 1590) agree with Sixtus,” who here reads *quatuor*, with many others; so that Grotius is well supported in having pronounced so decisively, “without doubt there is a mistake, two letters having been added at the end of arba. The thing itself declares that *four* years had elapsed.” Kennicott.—It appears to be indubitable, that some mistakes have taken place with regard to numbers. But that this place is incorrect may not be so certain, as the chronology of Salien, Usher, &c. explains it well enough. The Hebrew text was esteemed more correct when the last editions of S. Jerom, and of the Vulg. were given, than it is at present. H.  
**8** *Lord.* The pretext seemed very bad, since he ought not to have delayed so long to perform his vow. Moreover, the usual places for sacrifice were Gabaon or Sion. But Absalom might plead a respect for the patriarchs, who were buried at Hebron. S. Jer. Trad. M.  
**10** *Spies*, or men to give a plausible appearance to his ambition, and to insinuate that all was done according to order, and with David’s approbation. “The first word (or step) is the most difficult,” on such occasions; (Tacit. Hist. ii. Grot.) and those who find themselves incautiously entangled, find a repugnance to recede. H.—*Reigneth.* He was solemnly anointed. C. 19:10. M.  
**11** *Design.* Their hearts had been stolen, v. 6. They only meant to do honour to the prince, but by no means to join in his rebellion, like the rest. C.  
**12** *Achitophel*, the grandfather of Bethsabee; to revenge whose dishonour, he had instigated the young prince to revolt, and had planned his rebellion; (Salien) so that he was every ready to lend his assistance. C.  
**13** Absalom*.* How came they to abandon a king, appointed by heaven, and adorned with so many virtues? God was resolved to punish him. Many are always desirous of novelty. David had lately been guilty of two scandalous crimes. Joab remained unpunished, and arrogant; the judges neglected their duty, &c. v. 3. Some had still a partiality for the family of Saul. C. Grotius.  
**14** *Ruin*, of a house falling. Heb. “evil.” David gives way to the fury of the rebels, hoping that they will enter into themselves, without bloodshed. He departs on foot, like a penitent, acknowledging the justice of God. Fear does not prompt him to leave Jerusalem, which was a place of such strength, (C. 5:6) nor are his attendants abandoned on a sudden by that courage, which made some of them a match for a whole army. David disposes of all things with great coolness and prudence. C.—He wishes to appease God. M.  
**16** *Concubines.* That is, wives of an inferior degree, ( Ch. Gen. 25. W.) who might perhaps have some influence to pacify the rioters.  
**17** *House*, or palace, ( H.) at the foot of the walls, ( C.) that all who were well disposed, might join the king’s standard. Heb. “in a place that was far off;” ( H.) or, “this house of flight (this family of David, in flight) stopped.” C.  
**18** *Phelethi*, the king’s foreign guards, of Philistine extraction. C. 8:18.—*Gethites*, who had been probably induced to enter his service by Ethai, v. 19. C.—*Men.* This number David kept up, in honour of those valiant companions who had defended him at Odollam, &c. Salien.—It is observable, that David is attended only by his own family, and by strangers; representing Jesus Christ, who rejects the Synagogue and its sacrifices, while he makes choice of the Gentiles. C.  
**19** *Ethai* *.* Many assert that he was the son of Achis, and had embraced the true religion. M.—*King;* Absalom, who will not molest you. H.—Some translate the Heb. “Return from the king.” Syr. Arab.  
**20** *The Lord.* Heb. “mercy and truth with thee.” As thou hast acted towards me, so mayest thou be rewarded. H.  
**23** *Cedron.* Heb. nachal Kidron, may signify, “the shady torrent,” or “vale,” as it is styled by Josephus. It does not take its name from cedars. It is dry in summer, and when filled with water, in only three steps across. Doubdan xxvii.—*Desert*, of Bethel, ( C.) or of Jericho, where S. John Baptist and our Saviour dwelt for some time. David passed over Kedron, only after he had dismissed the priests. M.  
**24** *Went up* to the ark, or along with the rest. C.  
**25** *City.* Abiathar had consulted the Lord for David, and received no answer; whence the king concluded that he had not suffered enough. M.—David displays a faith which could hardly have been expected of the carnal Jews. He confesses that God will reward the virtuous, and punish the wicked, independently of the ark, the symbol of his presence, and of which he deemed himself unworthy. C.  
**27** *Seer*, supposing he was high priest, along with Abiathar, he might be thus addressed as one who consulted God by the ephod, as he might also, if he presided over the prophets, like Chonenias. 1 Par. 15:22. Dionysius. M.—Heb. “*Art not* thou a seer?” a prudent man, who may be of greater service to me in the city; ( H. *or*) seest thou not “the state of my affairs?” Sept. “See and return.” Follow my advice, or then act as your own wisdom dictates. C.  
**30** *Weeping*, &c. David on this occasion wept for his sins, which he knew were the cause of all his sufferings. Ch.—*Barefoot*, like a criminal, or one in mourning. Isai. 20:4, Ezec. 24:17. C.—*Covered*, that the people might not see him. W.  
**31** **Ve** **r.** **31** **.** *Infatuate:* “render useless;” (Theodotion) “dissipate,” Sept. C.—God hindered the wise counsel of Achitophel from being regarded. H.  
**32** *The Lord*, before he lost sight of the holy city, where the ark was kept. C.—*Arachite*, a convert, ( M.) from Arach, or Edessa. S. Jerom. Trad. in Gen. x.  
**33** *To me*, as he was perhaps advanced in years, though very prudent. M.  
**34** *Defeat;* (*dissi* *pabis*) “render of no effect.” H.—Thus princes keep spies in an enemy’s country. C.

## Chapter 16

**1** *Siba* was a mean character, but of sufficient discernment to judge that David would gain the day. He came to calumniate his master; and David paid too much attention to him, though his testimony would not have been received in a court of judicature. C.—We must reflect that the mind of David was full of trouble, and devoid of suspicion. H.—But he did wrong ( W.) in condemning Miphiboseth unheard.—*Raisins.* See 1 K. 25:18. C.—*Figs;* (*palatharum*) which are often called *caricarum* *.* M.—Heb. mea kayits, “a hundred of summer” fruits, like fresh grapes, (Num. 13:21) and other fruits, gathered after harvest time. Mic. 7:1.  
**2** *Loaves.* Heb. “and to fight.” But the Sept. and the Masorets reject the letter *l*, which causes the difference. C.  
**3** *Father:* a very improbable story, as the son of Jonathan was lame, and all Israel had declared for Absalom. M.  
**4** *All.* In the East, crimes are generally punished with the loss of goods. C.—*Kings.* He intimates that he had not spoken against his master, with a design to obtain his effects. M.  
**5** *Bahurim*, a fortress of Benjamin, about an hour’s walk east of Bethania. Adric. xxviii.—It signifies, “chosen youths;” and it is called Almut, or Almon, “youth.” 1 Par. 6:60. &c. Hither Phaltiel conducted Michol. C. 3:16. C.  
**7** Belial*;* contemner of the laws, and murderer. M.  
**9** *Dog.* David’s nephew was moved with indignation. He could easily have punished the insolence of Semei. H.  
**10** **.—** **11** **.** *Hath bid him curse.* Not that the Lord was the author of Semei’s sin, which proceeded purely from his own malice, and the abuse of his free-will; but that knowing and suffering his malicious disposition to break out on this occasion, he made use of him as his instrument to punish David for his sins. Ch.—He adored the justice of God; who is often said to do what he does not hinder, or what he only permits. E.—David is here a noble figure of Jesus Christ, excusing his executioners, ( H.) and receiving the insults of the Jews, without complaining. C.—If Semei had not been guilty of sin, but acted according to God’s will, he could not have been justly punished. 3 K. 2. W.  
**12** *Affliction*, of which he makes a sort of sacrifice, being convinced that God will not reject the contrite and humble heart. Ps. 50:19. C.  
**13** *Earth*, like a man in fury. Acts 22:23.  
**14** *There*, on the hill side, ( H.) at Bahurim, v. 5. M.  
**16** *Arachite;* perhaps descended from the ancient Aracites, who dwelt near Arad and Tripoli, where the pretended Sabbatic river is said to flow; (Jos. Bel. ii. 13.) or rather, as the names are written in a different manner, this person might be a native of Arachi, in Benjamin, west of Bethel. Jos. 16:2. C.—See C. 15:32.—*Friend.* This was his peculiar title of office. 1 Par. 27:33. C.—*King.* (*Salve.*) Lit. “Hail, O King,” in both places. The salutation is repeated for greater emphasis. H.  
**17** *Friend.* He rather accuses him of treachery. H.—But he does not mention the name of *king*, or of *father*, lest it should too plainly speak his own condemnation, as an ungrateful rebel. Salien.  
**18** *Chosen.* (*Vox populi, vox Dei*) Private people are not commonly able, or allowed, to judge of the right, which the prince has to the throne. But here Absalom was manifestly an usurper; and many still adhered to David. C.—Chusai assumes the character of a courtier, and flatters the prince; (Salien) who ought to have been on his guard. See C. 15:34. C.  
**21** *Their hands may be strengthened*, &c. The people might apprehend lest Absalom should be reconciled to his father; and therefore they followed him with some fear of being left in the lurch, till they saw such a crime committed, as seemed to make a reconciliation impossible. Ch.—This was the most heinous outrage that a son could offer to his father. Jacob resented it to the last. Gen. 49:4. Amyntor devoted his son Phœnix to all the furies, for a similar offence. Iliad ix. Armais treated the wives of his brother Sesostris in this manner, when he had resolved to rebel. Joseph. c. Ap. i.  
**22** *Israel*, who saw him enter the tents, ( C.) on the flat roof. C. 11:2. and 12:11. H.—The wives of the conquered king were reserved for the victor. Smerdis married all the wives of his predecessor, Cambyses. Herod. iii. 68. and 83. C.  
**23** Absalom*.* It tended to promote the end which was desired, ( H.) whether good or bad. His prudence is hyperbolically compared with the divine oracles; ( M.) and his authority must have had great weight, since David began to take precautions, only after he had heard that Achitophel had joined the rebels; and Absalom was persuaded ( C.) to perpetrate so foul and unnatural a crime publicly, no one daring to make any opposition. Chusai was silent; as he was aware that, if he began to contradict this counsellor at first, he would only incur suspicion. H.—The unjust commonly endeavour by all means to attach people to themselves: but God, in the end, turns their counsels against themselves. W.

## Chapter 17

**1** *This night.* Achitophel has a mind to shew that he is not only an able statesman, but a good general. H.—On such occasions, expedition is of the utmost consequence, that the people may not have time to enter into themselves, or to concentrate about their lawful king. “Nothing is more delightful than haste in civil discord, where action is more requisite than consultation.” By delays, “he would give the wicked an opportunity to repent, and the good would unite together. Crimes are confirmed by rushing on; good counsels by deliberation.” *Scelera impetu; bona consilia mora vales* *cere* *.* Tacit. Hist. i.  
**2** *Handed.* He has not had time to collect forces.—*Alone.* Heb. also, “the king also;” so that the people will be saved by flight. H.  
**3** *One man.* They will return with such unanimity, when their leader is cut off. M.—David was the *one man* whom his son desired to kill, as the latter was the only one whom David ordered to be spared. C. 18:5. H.—Heb. seems rather transposed: “I will bring back all the people to thee, as all the people, whom thou seekest, are returned; and all the people shall be in peace:” or, … “when all those, whom thou desirest, shall be returned, &c. C.—Sept. “as a bride returns to her husband; only the soul of one thou seekest, and peace shall be to all the people.” H.  
**7** *This time*, though he displays such prudence on all other occasions; or, “at this time” the situation of affairs is such, that it may prove dangerous to push people, who are already desperate, to extremities. Here we behold, how different sentiments may appear equally plausible. H.—*Mind*, reduced to despair. The maxim is beautiful, as well as the comparison. See Osee 13:7, Prov. 17:12, Lam. 3:10.—*People.* Heb. adds, “in the night;” or, “he will not suffer the people to pass the night” in repose. C.—He will not entrust his person to a faithless multitude, but will be surrounded with a chosen band, with whom he may escape, even though the rest should flee. H.—Achitophel had represented David abandoned by his men. M.  
**9** *First.* Heb. “If they attack them at first.” C.—Report will easily represent the engagement as unfavourable to Absalom; and this will be readily believed, as all are convinced of David’s valour. H.—Nothing ought to be risked in such beginnings. C.  
**10** *Man.* Heb. “the son of valour himself.” Achitophel, or any other. M.  
**11** *Of* *them*, their general. Heb. “and thy face shall go to battle.” Ex. 23:14.  
**12** *Dew*, which there falleth every night, in summer, like rain. Deut. 33:28. Some of the light armed troops of the Romans were called *Rorarii*, because they fell upon the enemy, and began the battle.  
**13** *Ropes*, armed with hooks, to pull down the walls, and to move the battering engines. All the discourse of Chusai tends to fill the mind of the young prince with vanity; as if he could overcome all opposition when surrounded with the armies of Israel, ( C.) at the head of which he would appear, instead of Achitophel, v. 1. M.  
**14** *Profitable*, to the cause of Absalom, more than that of Chusai, which was also very plausible. H.—*Lord.* The Scripture always directs us to fix our thoughts on God, as the arbiter of all human affairs. C.—Heb. “for the Lord had ordained to dissipate the good counsel,” &c. H.—“Plerumque qui fortunam mutaturus est consilia corrumpit, efficitque, quod miserrimum est, ut quod accidit, etiam merito accidisse videatur, et casus in culpam transeat,” Peterc. ii.  
**15** *Thus.* He discloses the secrets of the person who had consulted him, ( C.) as his engagements to David and to his country were prior, and more to be observed, to prevent the effects of civil war. H.  
**16** *Over* the Jordan, that it might be some sort of barrier, in case Absalom changed his mind, to follow the advice of Achitophel.  
**17** *Robel*, near Jerusalem, on the east. M.—*Maid*, under the pretence of washing linen. S. Jer. Trad.  
**18** *It*, as it was level with the ground; so that a cloth being spread over it, prevented all suspicion. It had no water.  
**19** *Barley*, which was afterwards fried with oil, and eaten. *Ptisanas* may also denote wheat, &c. *Grana cantusa* *.* Theodot.—“Figs.” C.—Sept. have the original (hariphoth) untranslated. H.  
**20** *Water.* Heb. “they have crossed the brook of water.” C.  
**22** *River.* Heb. “Jordan.” H.—They had travelled twenty leagues in the day and night after their departure from Jerusalem. C.  
**23** *Order*, making his will. M.—*Hanged himself.* Some Rabbins pretend that he died of quinsey, or suffocated with grief. But it is almost universally believed that he set a pattern to Judas, the traitor, in this mode of dying, as well as in perfidy. He was aware that Absalom was undone, and vexed that his counsel had been disregarded. The most prudent of this world are often blinded to their own welfare. The Jews had not yet begun to refuse the rites of sepulture to suicides. C.  
**24** *To the camp.* The city of Mahanaim, the name of which in Hebrew, signifies *The Camp.* It was a city of note at that time; as appears from its having been chosen by Isoboseth for the place of his residence. Ch.—The Vulgate often translates Mahanaim, or Manaim. See C. 2:8, 12. H.—*Him.* It is not known how soon. But he probably waited till he had collected his forces. David had done the like, and was joined by the king of Ammon, v. 27.  
**25** *Jazrael*, or Israel. D.—Gortius would read Ismael, as 1 Par. 2:17, *Jether, the Ismaelite.* H.—*Went in.* This expressing makes Sanchez believe that Amasa was illegitimate. M.—*Naas* is either the name of Isai’s wife, or rather the latter had both names. 1 Par. 2:13, 16. Sept. read Jesse, in the edition of Complut.; in others, Naas. C.—Joab; so that these two were own cousins, and both nephews of David.  
**27** *Camp*, v. 24. H.—*Sobi*, whom David had set upon the throne, instead of Hanon. C. 10.—*Machir*, who had the care of Miphiboseth. C. 9:4.—*Berzellai* *.* See C. 19:31.  
**28** *Beds*, will all the necessary furniture, coverlets, &c. Roman Sept. “ten beds, with fur on both sides.”—*Tapestry.* Some would translate, “bottles,” (Chal.) or “cauldrons;” (Roma. Sept.) but other editions agree with the Vulg.—*Vessels.* These are necessary, as much as things of greater magnificence. Precious metals were then rarely used in the kitchen.—*Pulse*, (*cicer*) or “parched peas.” Heb. kali, is thus twice translated, as it had been rendered *parched c* *orn.* It signifies any thing “parched.” The ancients made great use of such food in journeys, as the Ethiopians and Turks do still. Athen. ii. 13. Busbec. iii. Bellon. ii. 53. C.  
**29** *Calves.* Many translate the Heb. “cheese of kine.” Theodotion.—“Calves fed with milk.” H.—*Wilderness*, where they had been; unless this be placed out of its natural order. C.—The value of a present depends greatly on the time when it is made. H.—“How much dost thou esteem a hospitable reception in a wilderness?” &c. Seneca, Ben. vi. 15.

## Chapter 18

**1** *Hundreds.* Josephus only allows David 4000 men. But his army seems to have been pretty numerous, since he divides it into three parts, and appoints three head commanders, with officers of a thousand, &c. under them. See v. 4. C.—He designed to lead them to battle himself, if the people had not dissuaded him. Salien.  
**3** *Ten thousand*, “like us.” Heb. C.—*Succour us*, “by praying for us.” (Chal.) or by sending reinforcements, where they may be necessary. M.—David was persuaded “to reserve himself (like Otho) for the interest of the state, at a distance from the danger of battle.” Tacit. An. ii.  
**5** *Save us:* do not hurt, v. 12. S. Aug. (Doct. iii. 23.) concludes, that David wished to allow his son time for repentance. M.—He seems to have been sure of victory. Abul.  
**6** **Ver** **.** **6** **.** *Ephraim*, where the men of that tribe had formerly signalized themselves. Judg. 7 and 8 and 12. C.  
**8** *Country;* people fighting in great numbers. But the army of Absalom was soon dispersed. H.—*Consumed*, viz. by pits and precipices: Ch. “wild beasts.” Syr. &c. Many also died of their wounds, and were slain in the wood; ( C.) so that not less, probably, than 50,000 perished on this fatal day. H.  
**9** *Oak*, between the branches, which hindered him from escaping. C.—His beautiful curls got also entangled. M.  
**11** *Silver*, somewhat above a guinea: sicles are not expressed in Heb. H.—*Bel* *t*, the richest part of armour. Jonathan and Ajax made presents of their belts to David and Hector. 1 K. 18:4. Iliad H. See Job 13:18. The Romans wore very splendid belts. *Balteus et notis fulserunt ci* *ngula bullis* *.* Claud. Proserp. ii.  
**12** *Save.* Prot. “beware that none *touch* the young man.”  
**13** *My own.* Some copies of the Heb. and Sept. read, “*his;*” others, *my*, &c. The soldier would have acted against his conscience, and exposed his life to danger, if he had transgressed the king’s order. H.—*By me?* or, omitting the mark of interrogation, “Thou wouldst have declared thyself against me.” C.  
**14** *Sight.* Heb. “I will not tarry thus with thee.” I will not stand to refute these reasons, nor imitate thy example. H.  
**15** *Ten.* Naharai alone is specified. C. 23:37. Why he had ten does not appear. C.—*Slew him*, inflicting many wounds on him; though Joab had already done sufficient. H.—These men abused his corpse, as if to revenge the insult offered to David’s ten wives. Salien.—It is asked whether Joab did wrong? He consulted the public welfare, rather than the parental affection of the king for a son, whom the law condemned to die for rebellion, incest, and murder. Lev. 18:29. C. 13:28. But still he was not a proper judge to inflict this death in cold blood; and thus to render the salvation of Absalom’s soul more desperate. David would, however, have done well to have punished this son, as incorrigible and dangerous to the state. H.  
**17** *Him.* Thus was the law executed upon Absalom. Deut. 21:18. S. Jerom. M.—History scarcely affords a more detestable character; and his punishment was no less terrible than instructive. He was a figure of the Jews persecuting Jesus Christ, while he gave his blood for the redemption of these his enemies, and prayed for them. As they continued obdurate, they were held up as objects of horror both to heaven and to all nations, like Absalom suspended on the tree, and rejected by heaven and earth. C.  
**18** *No son.* The sons mentioned above, C. 14:27, were dead when this pillar was erected; unless we suppose he raised this pillar before they were born: ( Ch). or meant this pillar to perpetuate his memory, when they should be no more. Joseph. vii. 9.—This author says that it was a pillar of marble; so that it is different from that which Doubdan (15) mentions, observing, that all who pass throw a stone at it. Thus was his vanity chastised!—*Hand*, work. So Martial (viii. 51.) says of a vial! *Mentoris hæc manus est an, Polyclete, tua?* M.—The same word is translated, triumphal arch. 1 K. 15:12. G.  
**21** *Chusi* *:* perhaps, of Ethiopian extraction. Grot.  
**22** *Tidings.* People of reputation did not wish to perform this office. 3 K. 2:42. Heb. “these tidings will bring thee nothing;” or, “do not suit thee.” C.—Prot. “seeing thou hast no tidings ready?” H.  
**24** *Two gates*, one leading into the town, the other into the country. In the middle was a chamber for public meetings, and another above. Job 29:7. On the roof a guard was stationed on this occasion.  
**25** *Mouth.* If the army had been routed, all would have been in confusion. C.—Now they are employed in plundering the vanquished. M.  
**28** *Shut up;* frustrated the attempts of the enemy, and consigned many to the grave. H.  
**29** *Else.* This was false. v. 20. C.—But he wished not to communicate the bad news; for which reason he had got first to the king. H.  
**32** *Is.* This was as much as to tell plainly that he was dead, ( M.) or at least, a prisoner. But David understood him right. H.  
**33** *Wept*, in private. M.—*Would.* David lamented the death of Absalom, because of the wretched state in which he died; and therefore would have been glad to have saved his life, even by dying for him. In this he was a figure of Christ weeping, praying, and dying for his rebellious children, and even for them that crucified him. Ch. S. Amb. (de Ob. Valent.) Theod. q. 35.—David had presently ceased to weep for the son of Bethsabee, because he had reason to hope that he was saved. C.

## Chapter 19

**2** *Mourning*, as is commonly the case in civil wars. The king being oppressed with grief, a triumph was out of season. M.  
**3** *Shunned.* Heb. “stole away,” fearing to enter; though they did at last, in a clandestine manner, ( C.) by another gate. M.  
**4** *Head*, continuing to mourn. See C. 15:30.—Absalom*.* The name is often repeated, as is usual on such occasions. Virg. Ec. v.—Thus Bion says, “I bewail Adonis. The beautiful Adonis is no more,” &c.  
**5** *Shamed;* deceived the expectations. See Joel 2:12. Joab was one of those who spoil all their services by ostentation and rudeness. Like the first Anthony, *Immodicus lingua, obsequii insolens, nimius commemorandis quæ meruisset* *.* Tacit. Hist. iv.—He speaks to David, his king, as one friend would not do to another. “That sort of men is truly odious, who upbraid with their kindness; which those who have experienced, rather than the authors, ought to remember.” Cicero. Amicit.  
**6** *Thee.* What insolence! Kings are often forced to brook the affronts of their higher servants, as well as other masters. There is a gradation in human affairs, which make the next in dignity and power think himself equal to the highest. *Simil* *is ero altissimo* *.* Isai. 14:14. H.—David sincerely desired the welfare of all his people, as well as of Absalom. M.  
**7** *To.* (*satisfac*). Heb. “speak to the heart,” &c. with a cheerful countenance, to testify that their services will be rewarded. C.  
**8** *Israel*, the rebels, as distinguished from Juda, or those who adhered to David; though many of all the tribes sided with Absalom, v. 11. H.  
**10** **Ve** **r.** **10** **.** *Silent;* inactive and indifferent, as this word often denotes. Jos. 10:12. C.  
**11** *Priests*, whose influence was very great. H.—*Last.* David, like an able politician, shews the men of his own tribe, how dishonourable it will be for them to be outdone by the rest. C.—*Talk:* reported by a solemn ceremony. S. Jer. Trad. M.—Sept. λογος, “the word, ( H.) council,” &c. Salien.  
**13** *Flesh?* Amasa was his nephew, and as he had been appointed general by Absalom, his influence would be the greatest to bring back those who had given into the delusion. A sense of his misconduct would also render him more humble, and easier to manage than Joab, whose insolence caused him to be insupportable to the king. David designed to transfer the authority of the latter, ( C.) which he had now enjoyed 23 years, since the taking of Sion. David’s promise did not oblige him to keep Joab in that office for life, if his conduct should prove unsatisfactory. Hence he appointed Amasa to pursue the rebels, and afterwards Abisai, setting Joab aside. But the haughty warrior supplanted both, and retained the command, as it were in spite of his sovereign. C. 20:4, 15. &c. H.  
**14** *And he;* God, David, or rather Amasa. C.—All contributed, in different degrees, to bring about his happy union. H.  
**15** *Galgal*, and thence proceeded across the Jordan, ( C.) an hour and a half’s walk. M.  
**16** *Semei*, who had cursed David in his adversity, is now ready to fawn upon him, when he sees him restored to his throne. He was chief of a thousand, in Benjamin.  
**17** *Over*, or “into:” (*irrumpentes* *.* H.) probably on horseback. M.  
**18** *Fords.* Heb. also, “they took over the ferry-boat;” ( C.) or, “there went across a ferry-boat to carry over the,” &c.  
**20** *Joseph.* Semei was a Benjamite: but Joseph designates all the Israelites, except those of Juda, ( W.) as these two possessed the birth-right of Ruben. 1 Par. 5:1. M. See Ps. 79:1, Zac. 10:6.—But we may translate with the Sept. “before all the house of Joseph.” Chal. Syr. &c. C.  
**22** *Sons.* He refers to the preceding opposition of Joab, whom Abisai was beginning to imitate. H.—Satan*;* adversary. Mat. 16:23.—*This day.* Formerly, no one was to be put to death on days of rejoicing, and the prisoners were liberated when the king ascended the throne. A malefactor continued for a long time to be set free on the day of the passover. Mat. 27:15. C.—The Romans would never punish any one with death, on the days “whenever (Augustus) entered the city.” Sueton. lvii.—David considers this memorable day as a new epoch of his sovereignty, and will not suffer it to be rendered sorrowful. See 1 K. 11:13. H.—The punishment of Semei might have had the most pernicious consequences, as the rest of Israel would have feared a similar treatment. M.—Salien, A. 3010.  
**23** *Die*, during my life, ( M.) or by my hand, without some farther transgression. Hence the oath is worded, *I will not kill thee with the sword.* 3 K. 2:8. H.—Solomon was charged not to let his crime pass unpunished. But he did not kill him till he had shewed his disobedience. C.—The oaths of parents do not always ( H.) pertain to their heirs. Grotius.  
**24** *Feet*, which was very requisite in those countries, to prevent a disagreeable smell, for which the Jews were noted. Martial iv. 4.—Ammianus (2) speaking of the emperor Marcus says, *Cum Palestinam transiret, fœtentium Juædorum et t* *umultuantium sæpe tædio percitur* *.* Some have thought that this odour was removed by baptism. Basnage, T. iii. p. 194. Rom. Sept. adds, “neither had he cut his nails, nor (made or) dressed his mustaches,” or upper lip. The chin, as far as the ears, was not shaved by the Jews. To cut all the hair was a mark of sorrow, no less than to neglect dressing it. See Lev. 21:5. C.—By the external appearance of Miphiboseth, David might be convinced that he had indulged his grief for a long time; ( M.) which might serve to remove the ill impressions which he had received against the helpless son of his friend Jonathan.  
**25** *Met.* Prot. “was come to Jerusalem, to meet the king.” H.—But his usual residence was in the city, where Siba had left him. C. 16:3. We should therefore translate, “And coming to meet the king at his arrival in Jerusalem.” C.  
**26** *Despised.* Heb. and Chal. “acted treacherously against me.” M.  
**27** *God.* It is not necessary for me to say any more in my defence. Thou art convinced of my innocence; and the accusation was in itself improbable, as I could never expect to be better treated by another king. I am resigned to abide by thy decision. H.—I cannot complain. C.  
**28** **Ver** **.** **28** **.** *Death*, on account of Saul’s persecution, and his sons assuming the purple; so that all his adherents might have been justly slain. C.—*Cry*, as if I had been wronged. M.  
**29** *More.* Hebrew adds, “concerning thy affairs. I have said, Thou and Siba divide the inheritance.” H.—Thou as the owner, Siba as the administrator, or steward, as he was before. Jun. Malv.—Sanchez thinks that David made a compensation to Miphiboseth, for what he left in the hands of his servant, as he did not wish to disturb the harmony of the day, nor to inflict any punishment on offenders. M.—But most interpreters accuse David of injustice, in suffering Siba to reap the fruits of his perfidy, &c. Salien. C. &c.—It is not probable, however, that he would deviate from his wonted generosity, nor suffer Miphiboseth to be injured, if he were convinced of his innocence. Perhaps he might judge it expedient that Siba should have a separate establishment, as he was now unfit to act in his former capacity, and had shewn some sort of affection towards his sovereign, when his own son, and most of his subjects, had revolted against him. H.  
**30** *House.* He is all to me. M.  
**32** *Camp;* Mahanaim. C. 17:28.  
**33** **3** **.** *Secure.* Sept. “I will continually nourish thy old age.” H.  
**35** *Burden*, as I am unfit for any service. M.  
**36** *With thee.* He did not proceed as far as Galgal; ( H.) but took his leave of the king, intimating, what we never witness at the present day, that he was too old to enjoy the pleasures of a court! C.  
**37** *Chamaam*, is supposed to have been the son of the good old man. C.  
**40** **0** **.** *There;* coming up, for the most part, after the king had crossed the river. They had intended to have escorted him from Mahanaim. H.  
**41** *Stolen;* as if the king were not the common father of all. Salien.  
**42** *Nearer* related. H.—*Us.* What advantage have we gained? or, what have you lost? C.  
**43** *Ten parts.* They might have said they were twelve tribes for one; and though the tribe of Juda was more numerous than many others, it was not equal to them all. C.—But the disproportion was by no means so great as ten to one; so that the Israelites unjustly pretended, that they had so much greater pretensions to the honour of bringing the king to his capital, in a sort of triumph. David might perhaps have waited a little longer, ( H.) and shewed less predilection for his own tribe. C. Salien.—But what obligation was there for either? He had been long enough from Jerusalem, and eager to return, as soon as Amasa brought to him the tribe of Juda, and several of Benjamin, v. 16. What hindered the rest from coming in time? They seem to have pretended more loyalty than they really possessed; otherwise they would not have joined in every rebellion. H.—*First.* Hebrew may be, “did not I first propose the bringing back the king?” v. 11. C.—*Israel.* Tostat says, it is probable Juda asserted that the king did not, at all, belong to Israel; and hence Seba repeated the words with indignation. C. 20:1. It is wonderful that David did not repress this altercation. Abulensis supposes that he leaned too much towards his own tribe; for which, if true, we behold he was soon chastised; as God is always ready to reward or punish his servants. Salien.—But all that David said is not recorded. He could hardly have continued silent. All his endeavours to appease the sedition were, however, rendered abortive, by the evil dispositions of his subjects. H.

## Chapter 20

**1** Belial*.* Sept. “lawless.”—Jemini*.* The tribe of Benjamin continued to be rather disaffected. H.—*Part.* This was an usual mode of expressing a disunion. 3 K. 12:16, Acts 8:21. C.—See C. 19:43. H. Seba was perhaps a kinsman of Saul, ( M.) in come command. C.  
**2** *Jordan*, near which the contest had happened. Some chosen troops attended Seba to the north, while the rest went home.  
**3** *Widowhood*, or celibacy, ( M.) like nuns. Grot. Salien.—David could not with propriety approach to them, ( E.) as they resembled his daughters-in-law; (Lev. 18:15. M.) and no other person could marry them, while he was still their husband. H.—The punishment of seclusion was very small in the East, where women seldom go out. The Jews assert, that the widows of the Hebrew kings could not marry again. Selden. Uxor. i. 10.—The like custom formerly prevailed in Spain. Coun. of Toledo. xiii. 3. A.D. 683, of Saragossa, c. 5. A.D. 691. So great was the respect for the king or the apprehension, lest those who married their widows, should aspire to the throne. C.  
**4** *Here*, to be invested with the command over the army, and to pursue Seba. M.  
**5** *Him*, owing to some insuperable difficulties. He was not long behind, since he joined the forces at Gabaon, where he was treacherously slain by the envious Joab. H.  
**6** *Lord*, the king; or perhaps Joab. M.—A select company always attended the king; and some of these he sent, for greater expedition, to attack Seba, before he had become too strong.  
**7** *Men.* It seems Joab accompanied them, though in a manner divested of his command, by the king’s appointing Amasa, and then Abisai, to his exclusion. After the slaughter of the former, he resumed his authority; (v. 10) and David was forced to acquiesce, for fear of another civil war, reserving his punishment for more peaceable times. H.  
**8** *Stone*, where Abner and Joab had formerly joined battle. C. 2. M.—*Habit*, or body.—*Flank;* they usually hand at the thigh. Ps. 44:4.—*Strike* *:* the scabbard was very wide; so that, when it was hanging very high, it would easily fall out, when he stooped; and thus afford Joab an opportunity of stabbing Amasa, without suspicion. C.—Prot. “Joab’s garment, that he had put on, was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle *with* a sword, fastened upon his loins, in the sheath thereof, and as he went forth, it fell out.”  
**9** *God*, &c. Lit. “Hail, my brother.” H.—*Kiss him.* “In former times it was the custom, in Greece, for supplicants to touch the chin, (Plin. xi. 45.) having the left hand upon the person’s knees. Iliad A.) The touched a woman’s cheeks; (Eurip. Hecuba.) or, among the Hebrews, her chin. Cant. 2:6. The Turks and Arabs still kiss the beard, with the utmost reverence. Thevenot xxii. Darvieux, C. vii. C.  
**10** *Struck him* with his left hand. H.—*Side.* The same word is, elsewhere, translated *groin;* Sept. “loin.” Moderns commonly render “in the fifth *rib.*” C. 2:23. and 3:27. and 4:6. C.—Josephus, “the belly.”  
**11** *Some* *men.* The same author and the Heb. only mention “one of,” &c. H.—*Behold.* Thus they insult over him, being attached to Joab. Heb. “Who loves Joab? and who is David? Let him follow Joab;” or, “who is this who wished *to supplant* Joab? and who desired to be in David’s favour, after Joab? C.  
**12** *A certain.* Heb. “the man” stationed by Joab, near the body, to inform those who passed, that he had been justly slain. Josephus, (vii. 10,) who observes, that this crime of Joab proceeded from envy, and was less deserving of excuse than the murder of Abner. H.  
**14** *Tribes*, north-west of the Jordan. C.—*Abela and Bathmaacha.* Cities of the tribe of Nephtali. Ch.—The former is called simply Abel (4 K. 15:29. C.) as it is here by the Prot. version. H.—It is also called Abyla, (Luke 3:1,) and Hoba, (Gen. 14:15. C.) between Damascus and Paneas, (Euseb.) situated on the borders of Syria, as well as Beth Maaca, or “the canton of Maacha,” or Machati. Jos. 12:5.—*Chosen.* Heb. Berim, (which is translated “Berites,” by the Prot. H.) is derived from Bara, “to choose,” by S. Jerom. Sept. have read airim, “cities.” Some suppose that the inhabitants of Bahurim (near Mount Ephraim, v. 21, where Semei, a relation of Saul, and many disaffected people resided) shut themselves up with him in Abela.  
**15** *Works.* Heb. a bank, *or* terrace against the city, and it stood in the trench; ( H.) so that the town ditch was filled up, (Grot.) or terraces were raised, from which archers assailed the besieged. Joab made a ditch to defend his men from foreign assailants; and he had already taken the outward wall, so that the town could not hold out for any length of time.—*The walls.* S. Jerom thinks with battering rams: but they were not yet invented. C.—They undermined the walls, while some attempted to pull them down with hooks and ropes. C. 17:13. H.  
**16** *Say to Joab.* This woman was noted for her prudence, and it was hoped that her words would have more influence to disarm Joab. She addresses those who were nearest the wall, that she may have an interview with the general, at the request of her fellow-citizens.  
**18** *End* of their disputes, ( H.) as Abela was remarkable for its wise counsellors, ( M.) and equitable decisions; ( H.) so that many came, from a distance, to consult the learned of this city. C.—Others suppose that she refers to the law, which ordains that peace shall first be proposed, and, if this had been done, the affair would long ago have been decided. Deut. 20:10. Jonath. E. &c.—Heb. “They spoke a word at first: Let them ask at Abela, and so they shall make an end.” Much must be supplied to make the text conformable to the former explication. We may translate, “They said, in ancient times: Let those who require more, go seek at Abela: so they finished their discourse.” C.—Prot. “They shall surely ask *counsel* at Abel: and so the ended *the matter.*”  
**19** *Truth.* Heb. “I *am* peaceable, faithful in Israel.” H.—I am one of the cities most inclined to peace, and to the king’s service, noted for lessons of loyalty. C.—Probably there was an academy here. M.—*Mother*, city, or metropolis. The Hebrews styled the inferior towns, *daughters.* C.—*Lord*, a city belonging to Israel. H.  
**20** *God*, (*Absit* *.*) Lit. “Far be it, far be it from me;” as we need not put the name of God in the mouth of this profane man, without reason. H.  
**26** Jairite, a descendant of Jair, ( C.) son of Manasses. H.—*Priest.* Hebrew *cohen*, respected like a priest, ( H.) chief favourite, ( W.) the Rab. (Chal.) chief counsellor of David, (Vatab.) almoner, &c. It is not certain that he was of the family of Aaron, or qualified to be the domestic chaplain of the king. See C. 8:16, &c. No other king of Israel had an officer to whom this title was given. C.

## Chapter 21

**1** *Of David*, after the revolt of Seba. C.—*House.* It seems the family and chief officers of Saul, had concurred in his cruelty and unjust zeal. Hence many of them might be still living, to undergo this chastisement; and the rest of the people were guilty of some faults. H.—If they had been perfectly innocent, still God is the dispenser of his own gifts. He is under no obligation of sending health and peace to his creatures. The just often derive greater advantage from crosses than from prosperity. The exemplary punishment of Saul’s family was a lesson to kings, and to all mankind, to teach them how they ought to observe justice and the sanctity of oaths.—*Gabaonites;* probably after the slaughter of the priests, at Nobe. 1 K. 22:19. C.  
**2** *Amorrhites*, by which name all the nations of Chanaan were frequently designated. Gen. 15:16. M.—They were properly Hevites.—*Juda.* As if Josue, and all succeeding governors, had acted wrong. Ex. 23:33, Josue 6:19. Saul ought, at least, to have consulted God. C.  
**3** *Atonement*, to expiate the injury done to you by Saul; ( M.) and that you may turn your curses into blessings. The ancients were convinced, that God attends to the imprecations of the innocent. C.  
**4** *Gold.* It is supposed that David made them an offer of some. Salien, A. 1040.—*Israel* besides. At first they required all the progeny of Saul, nine in number, to be crucified: but, at David’s request, and intimation that he had sworn to protect the sons of Jonathan, Miphiboseth and Micha, ( H.) they were content with the death of seven. M.—They insisted upon the law of retaliation. Salien.—The custom of delivering up criminals to be executed by the relations of the injured dead, still subsists in the East. C.  
**6** *Chosen.* Some think it improbable that they should give Saul this title; and Castalion would substitute *ber*, “in the mountain,” (v. 9) instead of *bechir*, “anointed,” a title which Junius, however, refers to David: “O thou anointed,” &c. C.—But why might not these people recognize this character in Saul, which would make the punishment more disgraceful, as they chose the city of Saul, in preference, for the execution of his unhappy offspring? H.—*Them*, having received an order from God, lest the people might suspect that he was gratifying his private revenge. E. Josep. vii. 10, 12.  
**8** *Of Michol.* They were the sons of Merob, who was married to Hadriel; but they are here called the sons of Michol, because she adopted them, and brought them up as her own: ( Ch. Chal. S. Jer. Trad.) or Merob ws called Michol; (Sa.) or, what seems most probable, from the word *she bore* being used, (Cajet.) and as two sisters would hardly have the same name, ( H.) Micholhas crept into the text instead of Merob. Capel. Salien. C. 1 K. 25:44.  
**9** *Lord.* The prophets had frequented this hill. 1 K. 8:4, 13. So the Gabaonites crucified these seven, before an ancient altar, as victims to appease God’s anger, ( C.) for the treaty with them having been violated, ( H.) particularly after they had embraced the true religion. Salien. Deut. 10:19.—*Barley*, about Easter. M.  
**10** *Hair-cloth*, to sleep on, occasionally.—*Heaven.* The famine had been caused by drought. As soon therefore as rain fell, David was assured that God was appeased. He had suffered the bodies to hang so long, for that purpose, though commonly they were to be taken down before night. M.—Respha is supposed, by some, to have guarded the bodies from spring till the rain fell in autumn. But the former opinion seems more plausible. We here behold the custom of watching by the bodies of the dead. See Iliad xxiii.—*Beasts.* The gibbets were formerly very low. C.—Thus Blandina was exposed to wild beasts. Euseb. Hist. v. 1.  
**11** *Done.* Her piety and affliction were extraordinary. She had been brought up in delicacies, and was a person of uncommon beauty, so as to captivate Abner. C. 3:8. She must now have been advanced in years. H.  
**14** *Side* of the mountain, or in distinct cavities. C.—Many suppose that *Tsela*, or Sela, is the name of a place ( M.) not far from Gabaa. Jos. 18:28. C.—Many proper names are thus translated. D.  
**15** *Again:* it is not certain at what time. Some think it was towards the beginning of David’s reign, since he leads his men to battle; or the Philistines might have made an irruption into his dominions, about three years after the death of Absalom. C.—David had offered to put himself at the head of the army, against his son. C. 18:2. H.—*Faint.* He was now sixty-four years old. Salien.  
**16** *Jesbibenob* may signify, “Jesbi, the son of Ob.” Sept. “Jesbe, of Nob, who was of the race of the giants.” Arapha seems to have been one of great fame, (v. 18–21–22) who had several children; unless other giants assumed his name. C.—*Ounces.* Heb. “*sicles* of brass, in weight.” Sicles is only understood, as on similar occasions. Neither is *sword* expressed; ( H.) so that some think he had on a new suit of armour. Sym. “a sword.” Rom. Sept. “a club.” The weight of the whole spear is specified in Heb. Sept. &c. ( C.) as weighing “300—of brass,” ( H.) of which metal it seems to have been formed, as the Jews had no such money till the captivity.  
**17** *Lamp;* glory and protection. Achilles reproaches himself for not having been “a light to” his friend. Iliad Σ.  
**18** *Gob*, as *Gazer* was called by the Philistines; (1 Par. 20:4. Salien) unless ( H.) the former word be a mistake of the transcriber. C.—Sept. (Alex.) reads, Geth. H.—*Sobochai*, one of David’s valiant men. 1 Par. 11:29.—*Saphai* is added in 1 Chron. 20.  
**19** *Adeodatus, the so* *n of Forrest.* So it is rendered in the Latin Vulgate, by giving the interpretation of the Hebrew names, which are Elhanan, the son of Jaare. Ch.—We should translate all the proper names, or none; as the present mode is extremely perplexing. Adeodatus might therefore be rendered, “God given;” (*Dieudonne*, as the French have it, though they will not translate *Saltus*, but leave *Jaare*) or, if *Adeodatus* must remain, as it is sometimes a proper name, why may not *Saltus?* A mere English reader might suppose that *Forrest* was a Hebrew name, and, with Swift in jest, maintain the high antiquity of our language. H.—Regularly proper names should be retained. C.—But the learned have often chosen to give the import of foreign names, in the language in which they have been writing. See Du Thou’s History. Thus *Dubois* is styled Sylvius; Newman, Neander; &c.—*An embroiderer.* Prot. make this a part of the man’s name, “Jaare-oregim.” Sept. “the son of Ariorgeim.” In 1 Par. 20 no notice is taken of his profession. H.—That passage will evince that *Elhanan* is not the same with David, as some would infer from the mention of Goliath’s death, but the son of Jair, uncle of Joab, (C. 23:24.) who was born at Bethlehem, though the verse in Paral. would insinuate less correctly, that the giant’s name was Lechem, thus, “Elehanan … slew Lechem, the brother,” &c. as the copyist had written *ath* instead of *bith.* C.—Our version has not this mistake: “Adeodatus, the son of Saltus, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath, the Gethite,” &c. 1 Par. 20:5. H.—“It would be difficult to find a passage more disfigured than the present; and, without the help of the Paral. it would be impossible to make it out.” C.—Kennicott makes a similar remark. Diss. i. and ii. But he believes that the Book of Chronicles, though the latest, and usually the most corrupt, of the Old Testament, is here perfectly correct; and that the passage before us is strangely corrupted, “Jaare Oregim, a Bethlehemite,” being placed instead of, … “Jaor slew Lahmi,” as he thinks that *oregim*, “weavers,” has been inserted from the line below, p. 79. Josephus (vii. 10.) relates this transaction as follows, “When the king had sent a fresh army against them, Nephan, his relation, displayed the greatest valour. for engaging in a single combat with the bravest man of the Philistines, and killing his antagonist, he caused the rest to turn their backs, and many of the enemy fell in that battle.” Thus he evades all the difficulty, adding much out of his own head; and by Nephan, designating *Elehanan, the son of his* (Joab’s) *uncle*, (C. 23:24) or Dodo, a word which the Vulg. renders *patrui ejus*, “his paternal uncle,” though it hat a wider signification, and denotes other relations. Hence, as Joab was the nephew of David, this brave man might be in the same degree, and born of one of the children of Isai; or, perhaps, Josephus infers that he was a kinsman of David, because he was of the same city. H.—*Goliath.* He might have the same name as his brother, who had been slain by David forty-three years before; (Salien) or the title of *brother* may only signify, that this giant resembled the former in size and strength. Prov. 18:9.—*Beam.* See 1 K. 17:7. C.  
**20** *Fourth.* Josephus says this was the last war with the Philistines; and Tostat. supposes, that they wished to retake the city of Geth. Salien.—*Statute*, or “of contradiction.” Aquila.—Heb. Madon. Sept. leave it as the proper name of a place, “Madon,” specified Josue 11:1 and 12:19. Capel would read, “a man of Madian.”—*Six.* Such people were styled *Sedigiti*, among the Romans. The daughters of Horatius were thus distinguished, as well as the poet Volcatius. Pliny xi. 43.  
**22** *Of David*, who was present, though it does not appear that he slew any of the four. C.

## Chapter 22

**1** *Spoke*, &c. By comparing this with the 17th Psalm, we may be convinced how much the Hebrew varies, particularly if we examine also the MSS. Kennicott specifies no less than 600 variations in this one canticle, and refutes the opinion of those who say that the 17th Psalm is a second edition, corrected by David’s own hand, as the MSS. frequently shew that inaccuracies of the printed copies. He has collated them with Walton’s Polyglott. The variations are not however all distinct from each other, sometimes twenty MSS. having the same various readings, and may of the relate to the letter *v.* See Diss. ii. p. 565. We shall give the explication in the order of the Psalms. The collation of parallel passages is of infinite advantage. Frequently ( H.) the words differ so as to explain one another.—*Saul.* He is specified as the most dangerous. David, by divine inspiration, thanks God for his deliverance from all his enemies, both corporal and spiritual, enjoying peace of mind on account of his sins being forgiven, and all his opponents repressed. W.—This year, the thirty-seventh of David’s reign, was free from any commotion. Yet the king seems to have given way to a little vanity, on account of the many valiant men whom God had collected in his service; (C. 23) and hence he consented to the unfortunate resolution of numbering his subjects. Salien, A. 3016.  
**7** *Temple.* David was now busy in making preparations for it.  
**11** *Upon.* Cardell ( M.) would translate the Heb. “as in contest.”  
**13** *Kindled.* The words *abju abru* seem to be wanting here, as they are found in Syr. Arab. and the Psalm. Kennicott would render this most striking image, “at the brightness of his presence his clouds removed; They kindled into colas of fire,” &c. Diss. i.  
**14** *Shall.* Heb. as well in the past tense. “The Lord thundered,” &c. H.  
**16** *Overflowings.* Heb. “channels,” the waters receding as at the Red Sea, and at the passage of the Jordan.  
**22** *God.* Perhaps David might have written this before his fall; or, if afterwards, his sincere repentance had restored him to his former state.  
**26** *Holy;* treating all according to their deserts. H.  
**29** *Lamp.* Heb. Thair, “thou wilt light” *my lamp*, seems deficient; as it is found in some MSS. Syr. Arab. Ps. 17. &c. Kennicott.  
**44** *Me.* Though David conquered some Gentiles, and some were converted to the true faith under the Old Testament, yet the fulness of the Gentiles belongs to the Church of Christ, the perpetual stability of which is here foretold, v. 51. W.

## Chapter 23

**1** *Last words*, which he spoke by inspiration, ( M.) or which may be considered as the conclusion of his Psalms, and inserted after the 71st, ( C.) or as a preface or summary of those divine canticles; D. or they relate to the last ages, and to the Messias, (Chal.) *the end of the law.* H.—Some think it has not been inserted among the Psalms, as not being written in verse: (Sanctius) but it is composed in the true spirit of the Hebrew poetry, though very obscure.—*Christ*, who should be born of him; or David himself was appointed to be “the king” of God’s people. Sept. “he whom God raised up, the Christ of,” &c. Heb. “sovereign anointed of,” &c.—*Psalmist.* The Holy Spirit directs David to speak in his own praise. His Psalms were always most highly esteemed in Israel. C.—*Said.* This preamble may remind us of a similar one of Balaam. Num. 24:3. The prophets generally declare who they are. H.  
**2** *Tongue.* Nothing could more decisively prove the inspiration of the sacred books.  
**3** **V** **er.** **3** **.** *Strong one.* This is one of the most common titles of God, 1 K. 2:2. Heb. “the rock.”—*In the fear.* Heb. “of the fear;” that is, of the just, who live in the fear of God. Such abstract expressions are frequent; so “the son of the captivity, of riches,” &c. mean a captive or a rich man. C.—God spoke such words to David as tended to promote solid virtue and piety. H.—We may explain *the ruler*, &c. of the Messias, who shall diffuse grace and glory throughout the earth. Prot. “He that ruleth over men, *must be* just, ruling in the fear of God.” An excellent lesson for all in power. H.  
**4** *As* *the light*, &c. So shall be the kingdom of Christ. Ch.—Heb. “Like the morning light, shall the sun arise.” But is this sense? Is not the sun the light of the morning? The oldest Heb. MS. in England has the word *Jehova* before *Sun*, which seems to have acknowledged by the Sept. though now unintelligible; and thus we are freed from this difficulty, and the passage is proved to be prophetical of the great sun of justice. Malac. 4:2, Isai. 60:2. Kennicott, Dis. i. p. 471.—The Heb. is extremely obscure. C.—Prot. And *he shall be* as the light of the morning, *when* the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; *as* the tender grass *springeth* out of the earth by clear shining after rain. H.—These comparisons may be applied to the Psalms and other inspired writings, which enlighten the eyes; (Ps. 18:9,) or to Christ, whose glory surpasses that of the sun, (Ps. 71:5,) and whose graces produce the just. Isai. 45:8. M.—We might expect that David was going to compare the glory of his reign and of his family, with that of the rising sun. Judg. 5 ult. But he does not finish the comparison, being filled with a sense of his own misery. C.  
**5** *Neither is my house*, &c. As if he should say: This everlasting covenant was not due to my house: but purely owing to his bounty, who is all my salvation, and my will; that is, who hath always saved me, and granted me what I desired of him; so that I and my house, through his blessing, have sprung up, and succeeded in all things. Ch.—He clearly distinguishes between the covenant made with him as to his earthy kingdom, and that which regards Christ. W.—Even the former should be of long duration. Ps. 131:11. H.—*Up.* Heb. seems to contradict all that had gone before; “for it shall not flourish.” C.—Prot. “although he make *it* not to grow;” ( H.) unless we read with an interrogation, “And shall not my family flourish?” which was a natural reverence to v. 4. C.—God had blessed David with the dew of heaven, and with the fatness of the earth. M.—His glory and happiness should not be of short duration, like the brightest summer-day, or a transient flower. H.  
**6** *But.* This word is neglected by the Sept. who enjoin this to the preceding verse. “Because the lawless man shall not flourish. They are all like thorns thrust out, for they shall not be handled,” lest they prick. H.  
**8** *Jesbaham*, the son of Hachamoni. For this was the name of this hero, as appears from 1 Chron. 11:11. Ch.—But then *sitting*, &c. should not be retained. H.—*Most tender*, &c. He appeared like one tender and weak, but was indeed most valiant and strong. It seems the Latin has here given the interpretation of the Hebrew name of the hero, to whom *Jesbaham* was like, instead of the name itself, which was *Adino* the *Eznite*, one much renowned of old for his valour. Ch.—The Vulg. has, contrary to custom, translated many of the proper names. C.—The French version would suppose that Adino, the Heznite, was the hero’s name; and queen Elizabeth’s version (1599) is, “He that sat in the seat of wisdom, being chief of the princes, was Adino, the Eznite.” H.—But no such person is mentioned any where else, in the Bible; and these words have been corrupted, like many others in this chapter, as may be gathered from collating it with Chronicles, &c. Kennicott was encouraged to continue, if not to begin his labours, to shew the imperfection of the printed Hebrew, by comparing these passages, though he had formerly imagined that the text had been preserved in its original purity. See Dis. ii. p. 496. He shews the inaccuracy of queen Elizabeth’s version, and observes that some have very abruptly inferred, that David was the first of his own mighty men, from the Vulg. which is literally, “These are the names of the valiant men of David. Sitting in the chair, the most wise prince among the three. The same is like the most tender,” &c. No name is here specified, ( H.) though the catalogue be given expressly to honour their names.—*In the chair.* Heb. *Bashebeth*, “seems to be carelessly transcribed in here from the line above,” as *Oregim* was taken from the subsequent line. C. 21:19.—*Wisest.* Heb. “the Hachmonite.”—*Three;* it is in Heb. “the third;” and in Chron. *thirty*, improperly. Prot. “the Tachmonite, that sat in the seat, chief among the captains, (the same was Adino, the Eznite) against 800 whom he slew at one time,” is therefore inaccurate.—*Tachmonite* has the *th* corrupted, from *e*, which stands for *ben*, “*the son* of Hachmoni;” though, as the father of Jashobeam was Zadiel, it would be better rendered the Hachmonite, being his family or local name. It is not always possible to know which is meant. The ellipsis in the Prot. version, and the confounding of Jashobeam with Adino, cannot be excused. *Adinu* seems to be ( H.) corrupted from *auror*, (as v. 18, and 1 Par.) “lifted up;” *eatsnu*, a word retained in the Arabic language, for “his spear;” (Vulg.) *wood.* Le Clerc reads *eatsni*, which he deems inexplicable, no less than *Adinu* *:* but the best copies have *eatsnu* *;* so that we need not reject it.—*Killed*, or “wounded,” is the general interpretation of elol; but it signifies also, “a soldier.”—*Eight* is *three*, in Paral. Similar mistakes have probably arisen from the use of numeral letters. See 4 K. 8:26. We read, that *Abisai lifted up his spear against* 300. This was, perhaps, an usual number for a regiment of three companies. 1 K. 29:2. Both Jesbahan and Abisai ventured to contend, singly, with so superior a force; but the latter displayed rather less valour, so that he did not attain unto the glory of the former; which he ought to have done, if both had killed the same number. Kennicott would therefore translate, “These are the names of the mighty men, whom David had: Jashobeam, the Hachmonite, chief of the Three: He lifted up his spear against 300 soldiers, at one time.” He observes that thirty-seven heroes are particularly specified: (v. 39) Joab, (the captain-general) Jashobeam, Eleazar, Shammah, the first ternary) Abishai, Benaiah, and Asael; (the second ternary) after whom follow thirty, whose exploits are not recorded. If any should still maintain that this verse is correct, we must say ( H.) that Adino is a different person from Jesbaham, (as the Vulg. reads it, 1 Par.) and that he killed 800; whereas the latter was only *like* him, in as much as he slew 300. M.—The marvellous is greatly diminished by substituting 300 instead of 800, and by allowing that the heroes contended with, though they might not kill, the whole company of 300 soldiers. See Kennicott. It seems most rational to admit some corrections, to which we are led by the Sept. “Jesbaath, (Vatic. Jesbosthe, the Chanaanite) the son of Thakemoni. He was the chief of the three. *Adino, the Asonean*, is useless, ( C.) as a proper name: when corrected, it is rendered, ( H.) “he drew,” &c. Whence have they taken this, as it is not in Hebrew at present, unless they read, ( C.) *auror, elevavit*, “he lifted up his spear.” Ken.—The number of 300 slain by one man, in one engagement, is also more credible than 800. C.—Josephus increases the number to 900; but then he supposes they were slain in various battles. “The king had thirty-eight, chiefly renowned for their achievements … The first, Issaimos, the son of Achamani, who rushing, not once, but frequently, into the midst of the enemy, did not cease from slaughtering till he had killed 900.” We may observe that he increases the number of the mighty men. H.—Delany reduces it to thirty-six, though he afterwards reckons thirty-seven, erroneously making thirty-one commanders of the third order, when he ought to have allowed the odd one to be the captain-general, and placed him before the two ternaries. Lightfoot also reckons thirty-six, and mentions them in this remarkably false order: 1, Joab; 2, Adino, of Ezni, called Jashobeam, by office; 3, Eleazar. And in the second rank: 1, Abishai; 2, Shammah; 3, Benaiah. Kennicott.—All these officers were styled, *Shalischim.* See Ex. 14:7. C.—A body of “Thirty” was, perhaps, originally formed by David; and, though he afterwards admitted a greater number, they all went by the first name. Salien.  
**9** Dodo*.* In Latin, *Patrui ejus*, which is the interpretation of the Hebrew name Dodo*.* The same occurs in v. 24, ( Ch). and signifies, “of his paternal uncle.” H.—Sept. read *Dudia*, ( C.) “of his father’s brother.” He, or his father, is styled Dudai. 1 Par. 27:4. C.—Sept. (Alex.) translates both Dodo and Dodi, “the son of his father’s brother,” the son of Sousei, or (Vat.) Doudei. Dodi seems to be the more accurate here, as he is thus more distinguished from Dodo, v. 24. Chron. 5:26.—*Defied.* Heb. is incorrect, and ought to be a proper name as is evident from the word *there.* Josephus calls it, αρασαμω, (perhaps originally, αφασδαμω) Chron. Pasdammim, or Ephesdammim. 1 K. 17:1. It is hardly probable that the Hebrews should defy or upbraid the Philistines, and immediately run away. We should therefore translate with 1 Par. *men.* “He was with David at Pasdammim. And when the Philistines were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away, he arose,” &c. Kennicott.  
**10** *Sword;* holding it, and exerting himself so long; (Sanctius) or on account of the blood, which glued, as it were, his hand to the sword. Joseph. M.—This verse, and as far as *troop* in the following, is omitted in 1 Par.; so that Semma is not so much as mentioned, ( H.) and of course the number thirty seven cannot be found. Ken.—Perhaps Samaoth may be the same hero. 1 Par. 2:27 and 27:8. C.  
**11** *Troop.* Heb. Lachaya, has been much controverted: but it appears to be the name of Lechi, or Lehi, “the jaw-bone,” (Josephus and Sept. Complut.) so memorable for the exploit of Samson. Bochart Anim. p. 1. B. ii. 15.—Vulg. lit. *in statione*, “in a station.” Some copies of the Sept. “against wild beasts;” “To hunt wild beasts.” Syr. and Arab. But it is most probably the name of a place. C.—*Lentils.* 1 Par. *Barley* seems more correct, as the field could not be full of both at the same time; ( H.) and barley is of more general utility. Kennic.—Yet some would assert, that there was barley in one part and lentils in the other. Buxtorf, &c.  
**13** *Before this.* The exploits performed before the death of Goliath have been recorded. The following took place soon after the taking of Jerusalem. Heb. simply, “And three of the Schalischim came to David at harvest-time, (Paral, more correctly, *to the rocks*,) and into the cave,” &c. C.—*Three* is undoubtedly the proper word, though the printed Heb. copies have *thirty* in the text; except the most ancient edition of Ximenes, 1515, which retains *three*, with all the versions, and some Heb. MSS. and as v. 17 itself reads *among* would be better *above;* (v. 23,) as the three officers aforesaid were not of the body of thirty, but of a still higher order.—*Harvest.* Heb. el Katsir, is never used elsewhere in this sense; and the Sept. have left the latter word as a proper name, “at Kasoar;” *etsur* seems to have been the original word, as in Paral. “to the rock.” Such places had frequently caverns or strong holds, 1 K. 24:1, 4.—*Camp.* The Sept. also seem to have read mene, as in Par. instead of eith, which never occurs, for “a troop.” Ken.—This camp was distant from the station at Bethlehem, ( M.) which was distant from Jerusalem “two hours travel.” Maundrell.—*Giants*, or Raphaim, 2 K. 21:18. M.  
**14** *Garrison.* Lit. “station,” ( H.) or advanced guard.—*In.* The *b* is omitted in Heb. as on many other occasions; (4 K. 14:14. Ken.) owing perhaps to the following words beginning with the same letter. H.  
**15** *Gate.* David had been educated in that town. M.—He expresses his wish to see his native place delivered from the hands of the enemy, more than for water; (Sanctius. Ken.) or being very thirsty, he speaks his sentiments without designing that any should attempt to procure him the water. C.—The three valiant men considered his desire as a law. M.—They were not to be condemned of rashness, though it would have been such in ordinary men. Salien.—David only intended to try the valour of his soldiers. When they brought the water he would not drink, judging that precious things should be offered to God. W.  
**16** *Camp*, or station of soldiers, v. 13, 14.—*Offered it*, as “a libation,” according to the Heb. and Sept. Vayasec is commonly used; but *vinsoc*, in Par. is the truer reading, as “it contains the three radical letters; and it were greatly to be wished that the verbs in every other place had also those radical letters restored, which have been omitted by the Masorets, and supplied by their punctuations.” Ken. Dis. i. p. 154.—*Lord*, as a sacrifice, worthy of him, and to teach his followers to be temperate, ( M.) and not to expose their lives unnecessarily. H.—“He had formerly indulged himself in forbidden pleasures.” S. Greg.—David thus asked pardon for having, undesignedly, hazarded the lives of his men, (Ken.) and gave thanks for their safe return. Josephus.—A libation of water was solemnly made, 1 K. 7:6. The pagans used water when they had no wine, as they never sat down to meat, or offered sacrifice, without making a libation. C. See Iliad H. Æneid viii. 279.  
**17** *Drink.* This word is acknowledged in 1 Par. and in all the ancient versions. Ken.—Prot. supply, “*Is not this* the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?” Instead of *Jehova*, ( H.) which ought to have *m* prefixed, we find maleim; (1 Par.) a word never used in such solemn appeals to the Lord. This seems owing to the superstition of the Jews, who would not pronounce the former name, perhaps in imitation of the heathens, who kept the names of their tutelar gods secret, lest the enemy might call them out, and thus obtain possession of their country. See Macrob. iii. 9. No mention is made of the Romans making use of this mode of evocation at the last siege of Jerusalem, as they were unacquainted with the true name of God. Virgil (ii. 351,) writes,—  
**18** *Three.* Sept. (Alex.) and Josephus read “six hundred,” ( H.) against all the rest.  
**19** *Three.* Heb. haci, seems to be mistaken for *bossnim*, “above two;” as one of the Greek versions in the Hexapla renders it, with the Sept. “Of the three he was more honourable than two; therefore he was their captain, and yet to,” &c. Thus we see a double ternary fully established, v. 8. Kennicott.  
**20** *Banaias* *.* The *v* at the end of this man’s name, is wanting in Par. It serves to distinguish him more from one of the Thirty, who was the 11th captain in waiting on the king; (1 Par. 27:14,) whereas this was the third, (Ib. 5) and one of great renown. 3 K. 1:32.—*Lions.* Heb. ari, “a lion;” and el, “god,” designate people “of extraordinary valour.” Ken.—Hence the Arabians give the title to Ali, the son-in-law of Mahammed. Bochart, Anim. iii. 1.—These two were noblemen, (Chal.) giants, (Joseph.) or fortresses; (Vatab.) namely, Areopolis, which is divided into two parts by the Arnon. C.—Some suppose that he slew three real lions. The last, being in such a confined situation, enhanced his merit. Cajet. M.—The Alex. copy of the Sept. has a great omission of the words between *slew*, occasioned by the word recurring twice; as also v. 21. Dr. Milles attributes the omission of the famous text 1 John 5:7, to a similar case; μαρτυρουντις, being found in the subsequent verse. “*Proclivi admodum errore, quod norunt, quibus cum veteribus membranis res est* *.*” 2nd edit.—“A source of frequent mistakes, as all know who have consulted old MSS.”  
**21** *Sight*, for size. Josephus.—Heb. “a man of great aspect,” which 1 Par. properly explains “five cubits high.”—*Hand.* Sept. supply what seems to be omitted, “like a weaver’s beam,” (Ken.) as it is found in Paral.—*Rod*, or rather “a staff,” like David’s. 1 K. 17:43 and 14:43. H.—Some men, with a stick or codgel, will not fear to encounter a man armed; ( C.) as we see exemplified in Q. Curtius, (ix. 7,) where Dioxippus, the Athenian wrestler, overcame Horratas of Macedon, who had challenged him out in a fit of drunkenness. H.  
**23** *Who were.* Heb. “he was honourable above the thirty.” Sept. erroneously read *three;* as he was only the second in this series, though superior to the body of thirty. See v. 13. The versions seem here perplexed, for want of observing this distinction of ranks.—*Council.* Heb. “over his obedience,” or “guard.” Joseph. C. 20:23.—Sept. “over his own country,” mosspethu, instead of the present *el mishmahto, super au* *scultationem suam* *:* or rather *mossmorthu, custodiam suam* *.* Grot. Ken.—Banaias held a very distinguished rank among the officers at court. He was like the king’s eye and ear. H.—These titles were given to some by the eastern kings. Apuleius, Mundo. Brisson. Pers. i.—Midas was said to have such great ears, only on account of his spies. Conon. narrat. i. C.  
**24** *Was one.* Heb. the preposition *b* is here used, which signifies “above;” as v. 13 and 23 and as Junius renders it. H.—“Asael … was head of the thirty.” Arab.—He could not be one of that body, as the number is complete without him, and he is necessary to fill up the second ternary. The Book of Chronicles does not point this out with so much precision as it had been already done. Kennicott.—Asael was slain by Abner. C. 2:23. He was captain of the fourth band. 1 Par. 27:7.—*Elehanan*, the first of the thirty.—Dodo*.* Lit. *patrui ejus*, “of his (Asael’s) uncle,” which might, perhaps, be as well translated by 1 Par. 11:26. See C. 21:19. The Sept. give both, “Dodei, the son of his father’s brother,” as v. 9; ( H.) or “rather those two translations are by some transcriber, or editor, injudiciously thrown together.” Kennicott.  
**25** *Semm* *a* *.* The same with the third hero, though his country is differently written, v. 11. C.—But this is very improbable, as the number of 37 would be thus destroyed. The former was an Hararite. The Sept. style the present captain, *Samoth*, in 1 Par.; Vulg. *Sammoth* *;* and the Ald. copy has *Semoth* here. He was the fifth captain; (1 Par. 27:8,) and the four subsequent ones relieved each other in waiting on the king.—*Harodi*, more correct than *Arorite*, 1 Par. ( H.) as the Sept. also there terminate with *di.*—*Elica* is omitted, 1 Par. 11. (Kennic.) as he perhaps died soon; and Zabad succeeding to his honours, comes at the end of these 30 heroes. Ib. v. 30. Junius.  
**26** *Phalti* *.* Par. Phalonite. H.—*Nu* has been mistaken for *t.* This is the seventh captain in waiting. Heb. “Heletz, the Pelonite.” It will suffice here to express how Kennicott would write the names of the following mighty men; referring for more particulars to his learned Diss. on 1 Chron. 11 and to the notes on that chap. v. 28, &c. In the body of 30, he places, 1. Elehanan, the son of Dodo, of Bethlehem; 2. Shamhoth, the Harodite; 3. Elika, the Harodite; (supplied by Zabad) 4. Heletz, the Pelonite; 5. Ira, the son of Ikkesh, the Tekoite; 6. Abiezer, the Anathothite; 7. Sibbecai, the Hushathite; (as C. 21:18, 1 Par. 20:4 and 27:11,) 8. Ilai, the Ahohite; 9. Maharai, the Netophathite; 10. Heled, the son of Baanah, the Netophathite; 11. Ithai, the son of Ribai, of Gibea, of the sons of Benjamin; 12. Benaiah, the Pirathonite; 13. Hurai, of the brooks of Gaash; 14. Abialbon, the Arbathite; 15. Azmaveth, the Bahurimite; 16. Elihaba, the Shaalbonite; 17. Gouni, (a word lost in Heb.) of the sons of Hassum; 18. Jonathan, the son of Shamha, the Hararite; (see C. 21:21,) 19. Ahiham, the son of Shacar, the hararite; 20. Eliphelet, the son of Abasbai, the Maacathite; 21. Eliam, the son of Ahithophel, the Gilonite; 22. Hetzrai, the Carmelite; 23. Naarai, the son of Azbai; 24. Joal, the brother of Nathan, of Tzobah; (see 1 Par.) 25. Bani, the Gadite; 26. Tzelek, the Ammonite; 27. Naharai, the Barothite, armour-bearer of Joab, the son of Zeruiah; 28. Ira, the Ithrite; 29. Gareb, the Ithrite; 30. Uriah, the Hethite. After these follow Zabad and 15 other brave men, though less renowned than the preceding. 1 Par. 11:42. It is a pity that the Masorets have introduced a new mode of pronunciation, and that it has been adopted by the Prot. so that it is almost impossible to recognize in their work the scriptural names of the most ancient versions of the Sept. and Vulg. H.  
**27** *Mobonnai* *.* Sept. have translated the Heb. “of the sons,” mobni, (Kennicott) which is corrupted from sobci, or ( H.) *Sobbochai*, who was *a Husathite.* 1 Par. 11:29. C.  
**28** *Selmon*, or Ilai.  
**29** *Heled.* Heb. ends improperly in *b.*  
**30** *Heddai:* *d* is exchanged for *r* in Paral. Hurai*.*  
**31** *Abialbon*, or *Abiel.*—*Beromi*, or *Azmoth, a Bauramite.*  
**32** *Jonathan.* David’s nephew, (1 Par.) of the sons of Assem, a Gezonite. This ought, perhaps, to be “Gouni, of the sons,” &c. otherwise the name will be lost, contrary to the design of the sacred writer. The verse is not terminated at Jonathan. But he was *the son of Sage*, (or rather of Semma, as here, v. 33) *an Ararite.* 1 Par. H.—Sage was also the son of Samma, (v. 11,) as Sage and Age are visibly the same; ( C.) though of this we may doubt. H.  
**33** *Aliam*, &c. Par. *Ahiam, the son of Sacha* *r.* The change is easy.  
**34** *Eliphelet*, &c. or *Eliphal, the son of Ur; Hepher, a Macherathite; Ahia, a Phelonite; Hesro, a Carmelite.* See 1 Par. 11:35.  
**35** *Arbi* *.* Par. “Naari, the son of Azbai.” H.  
**36** *Igaal*, or Joel, the brother of Nathan. To reconcile these texts, we may say the person was adopted by his brother, or had married his daughter, which was not prohibited by the law.—*Bonni*, or Mibahar, the son of Agarai.  
**37** *Bearer*, or “squire.” W.—He is the only one specified, though there were others. H.  
**39** *Urias*, the husband of Bethsabee. We have observed (v. 25,) that in Paral. the number of 37 is completed by Zabad, instead of Elica. H.—Only 36 are specified in these catalogues, as the name of the sixth hero (v. 18,) is omitted, whom some take to be Sobati, Jonathan, (C. 21:22,) Joiada, (v. 20,) or Joab. C.—But the truth is, Joab is not mentioned here at all, as he was sufficiently known for the *chief;* (1 Par. 11:6,) and he makes up the number of 37. The sixth, therefore, was Asael; (v. 24,) and after him there are exactly 30. For though *Gonni* be lost, (v. 32,) Semma is substituted in the following verse. H.

## Chapter 24

**1** *Stirred up*, &c. This *stirring up*, was not the doing of God, but of satan; as it is expressly declared, 1 Chron. 21:1. Ch.—David was moved by vanity, &c. thus to displease God.—*Among* *.* Heb. “against;” as the king could have done nothing more prejudicial to his people, 70,000 of whom perished on this occasion, v. 15. H.—We might also translate, “The anger of the Lord continued against Israel: for David, for their misfortune, was moved to say, Go,” &c. as this would obviate the harshness of the expression. C.—However, as it is the same in the Sept. &c. and as similar words do not prove that God is the author of sin, we may explain this in the same sense, allowing that he suffered the evil to take place, knowing how to draw good out of it. S. Aug. &c. H.—Some take this Satan to be an evil counsellor. C.—The devil may be styled “the fury of God?” as he is his creature, though rebellious. W.  
**2** *Them.* He was led by curiosity. M.  
**3** *Thing.* He speaks in stronger terms, and adds, (1 Par. 21:3,) *which may be imputed as a sin to Israel.* Joab was not extremely religious: yet he perceived the evil consequences, and, along with the other *captains*, expressed his sentiments with more respect than on former occasions. H.  
**5** *God*, at the eastern extremity, on the banks of the Arnon.  
**6** *Hodsi.* Sept. Alex. (5) “of Gad and Eliazer, (6) and they came into Galaad, and into the land of Ethaon Adasai, and they went into Dan Jaran.” The other editions vary. Heb. means, “to the land of new subjects,” or “lately conquered” (Junius) from the Agarites, (1 Par. 5:10,) which agrees with this situation. C. Lyran.—The commissioners first took an account of the tribe of Ruben, ( M.) and then proceeded northward, till they returned from Dan towards the south. H.—*Woodland* *s.* S. Jerom reads *jar*, instead of *jan.* By transposing a letter, *ain* would signify Dan, “the spring,” which feeds the Jordan.  
**7** *Tyre*, the ancient; about 4000 paces from the new city, which stands in an island. Strabo xvi. See Jos. 19:29.  
**8** *Land.* Yet they did not number the Levites or Benjamin, nor even the rest exactly, as Joab acted with reluctance. 1 Par. 21:6 and 27:24. M.  
**9** *Ei* *ght … and five.* Theodotion says nine and four, which comes to the same sum. H.—But 1 Par. 21:5, reads, *eleven hundred thousand, and four hundred and seventy thousand fighting men:* though even there the Arab. version has the number here specified, which is less incredible. The fighting men are not above a fifth part of the population; and we may allow that David might have about seven million subjects. It seems, therefore, best to abandon the latter number as incorrect, since all commentators confess that similar mistakes have been made by the transcribers; and to maintain the contrary, would be indirectly to throw the blame upon the sacred writers. C.—Yet some account for the variation, by saying, that Joab gave not in the full number here, ( M. Abul. &c.) which seems contrary to the text, *there were found*, &c. H.—A. Lapide supposes, that the excess of number was occasioned by the subsequent list of the Levites, &c. But could they amount to so many? C.—And what proof is there that they were numbered, after the anger of God had manifested itself so severely? H.—Others affirm, that Joab did not take an account of the 288,000 chosen out of the twelve tribes, that 24,000 of them might guard the palace by turns, in each of the twelve months. 1 Par. 27:1. Bochart Anim. p. 1. B. ii. 37. Grot. &c.—But thus there will be 18,000 more than even in Paral. where we find in all 1,570,000, though the tribe of Juda have fewer, by 30,000, than in this book. To account for this, some say, ( H.) the proselytes are here taken in, or the inhabitants of all the territory, which was at first assigned to Juda. Jos. 19:29. M.—All this is conjecture, ( H.) and must remain among the systems of history. C.—If Joab chose to diminish the numbers of Israel, why has he increased those of Juda? Did he wish to flatter the king’s vanity, or partiality for his own tribe? It is difficult to say what interest Joab could have in withholding the truth; and for the sacred historian to countenance his delusion, would expose us to the same danger of mistake, and overthrow the authority of Scripture, therefore, most rational to suppose that we have here the true list of the warriors, and that the book of Paral. has been injured by the negligence of transcribers, as it has on many other occasions. H.  
**10** *David’s heart struck him, after the people were numbered.* That is, he was touched with a great remorse for the vanity and pride which had put him upon numbering the people. Ch.—His sin must have been internal, and probably involved a secret confidence in his riches and power, without referring all to God, ( H.) or trusting entirely in him. S. Amb. pœn. c. 9. S. Aug. c. Faust. xxii. 66. &c.—There was otherwise no prohibition for David’s taking this account, ( C.) which is so natural for a prince, and may frequently prove of great service. H.—Josephus (vii. 13.) and others assert, that he neglected to require the payment of half a sicle. T. E.—But where does God complain of this neglect? and how do they know that the injunction which was once given to Moses, when the tabernacle was furnished, (Ex. 30:12) was to remain in force afterwards? Oleaster (on Exod.) says David acted against God’s intention, who had promised that the Israelites should be innumerable. But this reason seems childish; and did not the king abstain, on that very account, from numbering any but those who were fit for war? 1 Par. 27:23. C.—*Struck him.* Contrition and confession are specified here, as satisfaction is, v. 12. Temporal sufferings are inflicted, even after the sin has been remitted, v. 16. W.  
**11** *And seer.* This was a peculiar distinction of the *prophet*, ( H.) who was appointed to direct David, ( M.) to whom he had been long attached. 1 K. 22:5. C.  
**13** *Seven.* Par. *three;* which makes the contrast more striking. H.—The Sept. and some copies of the Arab. version, have the latter number. C.—Gad might first propose seven, and then reduce it to three. M.—But did the prophet deliver the message twice? Usher pleads for the truth of both numbers, though he says, “It was always my opinion, that the Hebrew copy of the Old Testament has been no less exposed to the errors of writers, than that of the New, and all other books.” Synt. p. 219. Boxtorf also declares, “it is better piously to believe that both is right.” Why? “because both is written.” Antic. p. 401 and 420! The contradiction, in fact, seems to have been occasion by the mistake of a numeral letter, *g* (3) for *z* (7.) Kennicott.—Usher, Malvenda, &c. adopt an hypothesis, beautiful enough, but destitute of proof, when they say that God proposed three years in *punishment* of David’s criminal curiosity. But as that famine would have immediately followed the three years’ scarcity, already endured, (C. 21) and during the seventh, or sabbatical year, nothing could be reaped, the famine would thus rage for seven years. C.—Salien places the 62nd sabbatical year at this very time, A. 3017, and terminates the famine occasioned by the cruel injustice of Saul, A. 1013, which cannot agree with the aforesaid system. H.  
**14** *Lord*, and be exposed to the violence of pestilence, which attacks both rich and poor; whereas the rich can frequently escape the dangers of war, or of famine. C.—David knew that he had sinned, and he did not wish to screen himself from suffering the temporal punishment due to sin. H.—God punishes us equally by the hand of men, as by other means; but the king thus intimates, that he looks upon Him as an indulgent father, who is less severe than the ministers of justice. M.  
**15** *And.* Sept. insert, “And David chose death, (the pestilence, as they usually render it; Salien). And it was the time of the wheat-harvest. And the Lord gave death in Israel, from morning till dinner-time.” H.—*Appointed*, for three days; though before the end of the last, God took pity on the people, ver 16. C.—Bochart thinks the pestilence ceased to rage at some hour of the first day. Syr. and Arab. “till the sixth hour.”  
**16** *Areuna* *.* Heb. styles him, Araniah, (v. 18. C.) *i* being substituted for *u*, and placed after *n.* He is called *Ornan*, 1 Par. 21:18, ( H.) and has the title of Jebusite, as he was originally of that nation, and had been permitted to retain his effects, on his embracing the true religion. Moria was his property, and seems not to have been much inhabited. It was not yet enclosed within the city walls. Here David saw the angel, in the air, ready to strike the inhabitants, and heard the voice from heaven. C.—He had already witnessed the death of many in the city. 1 Par. 21:14. The angel waited for God’s orders how many to destroy. H.—He did not sheath his sword till David had offered sacrifice to appease the Lord; (v. 21) though others think that the sacrifice was to thank God for the deliverance. C.  
**17** *Are*, like sheep. M.—They were not accountable for the fault of their shepherd, or king; nor were they punished for it, ( H.) but for joining in the revolts of Absalom, Seba, &c. (Salien) as well as for other secret offences. H.—Some groundlessly condemn the people, for entertaining sentiments of pride, along with David. Both king and people suffer, when either draws down the vengeance of heaven.  
**18** *Altar.* This was done by a positive order. People still had the liberty of sacrificing on the heights of Gabaon. C.—This place was honoured with the tabernacle; and David would have gone thither, if he had not been so much terrified. 1 Par. 21:30. H.  
**22** *Wain.* So Josephus reads. Sept. “wheels.” Heb. “rollers,” to beat out the corn. C.—Prot. “threshing instruments, and *other* instruments of the oxen for wood.” Paral. adds, that Areuna offered wheat, and saw the angel, as his four sons, and probably most of the inhabitants of Jerusalem did.  
**23** *As a king.* Lit. “king Areuna:” *e* may have been substituted for *c*, “like,” though the latter word is often understood. H.—Some suppose that he was formerly king of the Jebusites, (Vatab.) or one of their descendants, (Grot.) or possessed of great riches, &c. But why is the title never given to him elsewhere? Bochart.—The Sept. Syr. and many Latin copies, do not recognize it; nor was it found in the Chaldean, in the 12th age. Yet without making any changes, we may translate, “O king, Areuna has given all these things to the king.” The Jews often speak of themselves in the third person, out of respect. Le Clerc. C.  
**24** *Free-cost*, or given gratis. This shews that subjects have property, otherwise they could only yield what was due to the king, as his own. W.—*Silver.* Sept. “for the silver of fifty sicles.” H.—Bochart explains for the money of 50 sicles *of gold*, which makes 600 sicles *of silver.* Gold was formerly as twelve to one, compared with silver. Plato in Hipparcho.—But the best method of reconciling this passage with 1 Par. is to say, that David gave the 50 sicles for the oxen and floor, and afterwards purchased the whole piece of ground for 600 ( C.) sicles of gold, (or 902*l.* 5*s.* sterling. H.) being informed that the temple was to be erected there, ( C.) where Isaac had formerly been brought to be sacrificed. M.—We might make a colon, or pause, at *floor*, as if its price were specified elsewhere, and the fifty sicles were given for the oxen. D. M.—The sum amounts to only about 1*l.* 14*s.* H.  
**25** *Holocausts;* a second time. The former victims had been consumed by *fire* from heaven. 1 Par. 26:28. C.
