# 2 Kings Commentary

**This** Book brings us to the conclusion of the kingdom of Israel, (C. 17) and to the captivity of Juda, at Babylon. C. 25. We behold some virtuous princes reigning over the two tribes, while the ten were uniformly governed by men of perverse morals. W.—Yet there were some who adhered to the Lord in both kingdoms. David and his descendants ( H.) occupy the throne near 480 years; and, after the captivity, continue in some degree of honour till the coming of Christ. W.—But various families rule over Israel; some by usurpation, ( H.) others by God’s appointment: who thus chooses to chastise the wicked. He still watches over his Church, and sends his prophets for the instruction of all. W.—We have enquired in the preface of the former Book, who composed this. H.—The kingdom of Israel subsists about 250, ( W.) or 254 years. This Book contains the transactions of 308 years. C.—But the chronology is extremely perplexed. To the sixth year of Ezechias, when Israel was led away captive, the kingdom of Juda seems to have lasted 260, and that of Israel only 241 years, though they both commenced at the same period. The errors regard the kings of Isreal, according to Houbigant, who would assign the following years to the respective kings of Juda and Israel. 1. Of Juda: Solomon, 40; Roboam, 17; Abiam, 3; Asa, 41, Josaphat, 25; Joram, 8; Ochozias, 1; (the same is said to have begun to reign in the preceding year, the 11th of Joram, 4 K. 9:29, incorrectly) Athalia, 6; Joas, 40; Amasias, 29; (he reigns 15 after the death of Joas, king of Isreal) Azarias, 52; Joatham, 16; Achaz, 16; Ezechias, 6; in which year, the three hundredth from the commencement of Solomon’s reign, and the two hundred and sixtieth of the kingdom of Juda, Samaria was taken. 2. The kings of Israel: Jeroboam, 22; Nadab, 2; Baasa, 24; Ela, 2; Zambri, 7 *days;* Amri, 12; Achab, 22; Ochozias, 2; Joram, 12; Jehu, 28; Joachaz, 17; Joas, 16; Jeroboam, 41; Zacharias, 10½; (in the text 10 is omitted. H.) Sellum, 1 *mon* *th;* Manahem, 10; Phaceia, 2; Phacee, 30; (in the text, 20. H.) Osee, 9; in all, 261½ years, (Houbig. Chron. Sac.) or 261 years and 7 months. The variation of 19 months, which still appears, may be owing to some of the years being incomplete. H.—3. After a reign of 28 years over Juda, Ezechias is succeeded by Manasses, who reigns 55: Amon, 2; Josias, 31; Joachaz, a few months; Eliacim, or Joakim, 11; Joachin, Conias, or Jechonias, had reigned ten years with his father. After three months and ten days reigning alone, he is led away to Babylon with part of the people. Matthanias, or Sedecias, is appointed in his stead; but proving refractory, is also, after nine years, deprived of his sight, and conducted with 832 of his subjects to Babylon. Nabuchodonosor had already led away 3023, under Joachin. After the death of Godolias, who was left to govern the miserable remains of the people, A. 3417, he made 745 more captives, and thus an end was put to the kingdom of Juda. The scourge had been retarded for some time, by the repentance of Manasses, and the prayers of the prophets. C.

## Chapter 1

**1** *Rebelled:* lit. “prevaricated.” H.—The kings of Israel kept some of the nations, which David had conquered, in subjection, while the kings of Juda ruled over the others. In consequence of the late disaster, these people began to throw off the yoke. T.—Joram made war upon Moab. C. 3:5. God began to punish the house of Achab, by these means. C.—The Moabites refused to pay tribute, ( M.) as the Israelites would not acknowledge the divine authority. H.  
**2** *Lattices*, by a skylight, ( H.) or trap-door, designed to give light to the room below, into which the king fell. The roofs are generally flat in the East, and covered with earth mixed with straw, with the light at the top, to prevent the excessive heats.—*Of.* Heb. &c. “into.” C.—If the lattices be understood to mean the rails, which were ordered to be placed round the roof, (Deut. 22:8.) Ochozias might fall into the street. M.—Josephus thinks he fell from the staircase. At any rate, he was much hurt, ( H.) and thus was made to feel the indignation of God. T.—*God.* Sept. “Baal, the god-fly;” ( C.) the Jupiter of the Greeks, or their chief god; and *the prince of devils.* Mat. 12.—*Accaron* *.* Hence Pliny (viii. 29.) styles the god Achor, T. and Myiodis, (B. xxxvi.) which is the name given to him by Josephus, ix. 2. H.—He was supposed to free the people of the country from being infested with flies; or the many victims offered up to him, drew those insects together. Vatable.—Grotius supposes that the Phœnicians styled their god, *Beelsemen*, (Balssomin) “God of heaven;” and that the Hebrews called him, *Balzobub*, “god of flies,” out of contempt. But perhaps his is too favourable to the idolaters. D.—Selden is convinced that Ochozias gives the idol its real name. Scaliger rather thinks that *Balzobeim*, “the lord of victims,” was the original title. H.  
**4** *Away;* probably to his usual abode, at Carmel, where the king sent to seize him.  
**5** *Messengers.* They were perhaps citizens of Accaron, who had extolled the sagacity of their god, but were totally unacquainted with Elias. Yet as he shewed his knowledge of secret things, by telling them what they were going about, (Salien) and spoke with such assurance, ( H.) they thought proper to return, lest they should incur a similar punishment. M.  
**8** *Man.* Heb. ish bahal sehar, “a man lord of hair,” or all covered with it, having a long beard, like the ancient sages, (S. Jer. in Ezec. xxxv.) and clothed with a skin, (Bochart) as the first inhabitants of the earth, the heroes, prophets and S. John the Baptist, are described. Heb. 11:37. Matt. 3:4. So Statius (ii. and iv.) says:  
**9** *Under him;* his own guards. The captain was to request him to pray for the king’s recovery; ( C.) or rather, ( H.) to punish him for what he had said to the messengers. C.—*Of God.* Procopius and others think that he spoke contemptuously, and was therefore punished. M.—*Down.* The prophets are not bound to obey kings, in the exercise of their ministry. Grotius.—Elias complies as soon as he had orders from God. C.  
**10** *Let fire*, &c. Elias was inspired to call down fire from heaven upon these captains, who came to apprehend him; not out of a desire to gratify any private passion, but to punish the insult offered to religion, to confirm his mission, and to shew how vain are the efforts of men against God and his servants, whom he has a mind to protect. Ch.—The Roman laws authorized a person, in authority, to punish those who refuse to obey. Ulpian 1 D. *Si quis jus dicenti non obtemperaverit, omnibus concessum est suam jurisdictionem defendere pœnali judicio* *.* Elias acted as God’s envoy, and the insult reverted upon him. S. Tho. 2. 2. q. 108, a. 2.—The Manichees have blamed the conduct of the prophet: but the miracle justifies him, as God would never countenance the private revenge of any one; and the Holy Ghost places this transaction on a level with that when Elias shut up the heavens. Eccli. 48:3. S. Peter was moved with the like zeal. Acts 5:5. The sons of Zebedee gave way to some private indignation, when they wished our Saviour to call down fire from heaven upon a city of Samaria. Luke 9:54. But he reprimanded them for it; as the citizens might not be so well acquainted with him, as these soldiers must have been with Elias: and he came to display the spirit of mildness, ( C.) to attract all to his holy religion; while Elias had manifested the severity of the divine judgments, conformably to the law of terror, under which he lived. H.—In zeal of justice, Elias procured fire to burn these wicked men, as he had done for the holocaust. S. Aug. W.  
**11** *Another*, not knowing what was become of the first, or why he did not return; as Ochozias was eager to have the prophet in his power. M.—If he were acquainted with his fate, ( H.) this second captain was guilty of greater insolence. But there are such generally to be found at courts; men who are ready to execute the king’s orders, without considering whether they be contrary to God’s law or not.  
**13** *Again.* This third captain is commonly supposed to be Abdias, (3 K. 18:3) though without much reason. C.—John of Jerus, (c. 15) says he left the court, and became a disciple of Elias, and a prophet. M.—But he is very different from the prophet, whose writings are still extant. C.—The report of the two miracles had come to his ears, and filled him with fear. M.—*Despise not.* Heb. “let my life … be precious in thy sight.” 1 K. 26:21. Ps. 115:15.  
**17** *The second year of Joram*, &c. counted from the time that he was associated to the throne of his father Josaphat; ( Ch). so that it is said that he reigned also *in the 18th year of Josaphat.* C. 3:1. See also C. 8:16. To obviate there apparent contradictions, chronologists suppose that Joram reigned over Israel in the 18th of Josaphat, king of Juda, and in the second year after the latter had appointed his son Joram viceroy. He was associated with his father on the throne two years before his death, and in the 5th of Joram, king of Israel. Examples of this kind are frequent among the Hebrews, and particularly among the Persians, whose chronology is thus rendered very difficult. Why should we allow that the numbers are erroneous, when this explanation will suffice? C.—Grotius leaves the matter undecided. D.—Capel (Crit. p. 414.) maintains that the numbers have been ill transcribed; and so does Houbigant, who asserts that such a mode of writing whould not be tolerated in a profane author; thus the mention of different dates, without intimating how they are to be reconciled. If we should read, that Heraclius began to reign “in the 18th year of Chosroes,” and a little after, that he ascended the throne “in the second year of the son of Chosroes,” without ever specifying how Heraclius began his reign at two different periods, who would not suspect a mistake? Is it not more rational to throw the blame on the transcriber, than on the author? The modern chronologists seem to have invented the idea of viceroys and simultaneous kings, among the Hebrews, merely to get over difficulties; though the Scripture be entirely silent on this head. Houbigant would therefore read, “in the 22d year of Josaphat,” as the mention of Joram seems here improper, (*absurda*) his father reigning 25 years. Ochozias began to reign when Josaphat had almost completed his 17th year. See 3 K. 22:52. H.—*His brother* is not specified in Heb. Chal. Arab. and in some copies of the Sept. but it is in most others, as well as in the Syriac, ( C.) Josephus, &c. ( H.) and this is the common opinion. The Roman edition here inserts ( C.) after *Elias spoke*, (18) “And the, &c … and Joram,” &c. nearly as C. 3:1. 2. 3; only for *father*, it substitutes, “not like his brothers;” and adds, “the wrath of the Lord was enkindled against the house of Achab.” No mention is made of the second year of Joram, &c. ( H.) in any edition of the Sept. Capel.—In the mean time Josaphat, being returned from the unfortunate expedition with Achab, set his kingdom in order, purifying it from all the vestiges of idolatry, as much as he was able, and appointing proper judges. 2 Par. 19.

## Chapter 2

**1** *Heaven.* By *heaven* here is meant, the air, the lowest of the heavenly regions, ( Ch). through which he was carried by the ministry of angels, who directed the storm, ( H.) to the place designed for him.—It is generally supposed to be Paradise, ( C.) whither Henoch had been translated. H.—They are still living, ( C.) and must come again, to invite all to repent. After which they will die martyrs, in the persecution of Antichrist. H.—See S. Aug. de Gen. ad lit. ix. 6. et Apoc. 11. W.—Eccli. 48:10. M.—They are a proof of a future resurrection. C.—To decide where the paradise which they inhabit, ( H.) is situated. would be rash. S. Chrys. hom. 21. in Gen. &c. Some suppose it is still in some unknown region of the earth: others place it above the sky, ( M.) or in the bosom of Abraham. C.—The Jews (ap. Munster) assert that Elias penetrated the sphere of fire, where his body was consumed. Vat.—The earthly paradise is very probably no longer existing, in its ancient luxuriant state. H.—It may now be covered with the waters of the Persian Gulf. Worthington.  
**3** *The sons of the prophets.* That is, the disciples of the prophets; who seem to have had their schools, like colleges or communities, in Bethel, Jericho, and other places, in the days of Elias and Eliseus. Ch.—Many of these disciples might be also their children. Elias collected some fervent souls together even at Bethel, to preserve the true religion, as much as possible. He visited them before his departure. C.—*Peace:* let not Elias hear us.  
**5** *From thee.* Heb. “from thy head,” thy superior, and raise him into the air, v. 3. C.  
**6** *Thee.* Elias had tried the constancy of his disciple three times, as Christ required of S. Peter a triple confession of love. Jo. 21:17. H.—Humility might also prompt the prophet to desire to be alone. Salien.  
**8** *Mantle.* Sept. μηλωτην, “sheep skin,” ( M.) such as the prophets wore. The Syriac explains it of an ornament or bandage of the head; others, of a leathren mantle to keep off rain. *Ad subitas nunquam scortea diset aquas* *.* Martial xiv.  
**9** *Double spirit.* A *double* portion of thy *spirit*, as thy eldest son and heir: or thy *spirit*, which is *double*, in comparison of that which God usually imparteth to his prophets; ( Ch). or the power of working miracles, as well as of prophesying. W.—He wishes to excel his fellow disciples, rather than his master. T. Cajet. Amama.—*Double* often means, great and perfect. Jer. 17:18. If Eliseus even begged that he might perform more and greater wonders than his master, (as Christ enabled his disciples to surpass himself, in this particular. Jo. 14:12. H.) he might do it without pride, purely for the glory of God. He certainly shone forth with peculiar splendour; and some have enumerated sixteen or twenty-four of his miracles, while they can only find eight (Lyran.) or twelve recorded of Elias. See A. Lapide, in Eccli. xlviii. 13. C.—We read a similar expression in Pindar, (Olym. vi.) where Neptune gave his son Jamus (Θησαυρον διδυμον μαντοσυνας) “the double treasure of divination,” p. 50. Ed. Step. H.  
**10** *Hard thing.* Heb. lit. “thou art hardened to ask” a thing so difficult, and which I have not the power to grant. But I will pray that thou mayst receive it; ( C.) and I feel confident that thou wilt, if God shall grant thee the power to see me, at my departure. H.—This he did, v. 12. M.—Elias had perhaps imagined that his disciple would have desired some of his clothes, or some advice. C.—He left him his mantle, (v. 13. H.) and by prayer was enabled to communicate his spirit to him; as Moses and the apostles did to their assistants in the ministry. C.  
**11** *Horses.* Angels assumed these forms, (Grotius) or a cloud, resembling a fiery chariot and horses, was impelled by a strong wind, under their guidance. Tostat. M. Salien, A.C. 914.—As the name of Elias is very like Helios, “the sun,” some have supposed that hey have the same meaning: (Sedulius, pasc. 1.) but the Heb. term signifies, “He is my God.” The pagans have taken occasion from this history to represent the sun drawn in a fiery chariot, by horses composed of the same element.  
**12** *Thereof.* Thou alone wast equal to an army, in our defence. Chariots were then very common. C.—Chal. and Vatab. “Thou wast, by thy prayer, better to Israel than chariots and horses.” So we should call a person, a pillar of the state, &c. T.—In giving the character of Elias, the Holy Ghost dwells in a particular manner on his burning zeal. C.—*Elias stood up as a fire, and his word burnt like a torch … he brought down fire from heaven* *thrice*, on the holocaust, and on the captains. H.—*Who can glory like to thee?* Eccli. 38:14. See SS. Amb. and Chrys. on Elias. His resemblance with Christ is very striking. His name puts us in mind of Christ’s divinity; who burnt with zeal for God’s house, (Jo. 2:17) was persecuted, ( C.) raised the dead to life, rose again and ascended triumphant into heaven, having imparted his blessing ( H.) and his sacraments to his disciples. C.—*No more*, as he was taken from the company of men. H.—*Pieces*, to express his grief, at being deprived of so excellent a master. M.  
**13** *Mantle*, as an earnest of his affection. By the imposition of this mantle, he had been called to be a prophet. 3 K. 19:19.  
**14** *Not divided.* God thus prevented him from giving way to vanity, (Abul. q. 28.) or thinking that he could do any thing himself. H.—*Elias.* Heb. “where is he?” C.—The original and Sept. (Alex. and Vat.) do not specify that he struck the waters twice, or that they did not divide at first. H.—This is taken from other copies of the Sept. Amama.—The exclamation contains a most fervent prayer. Heb. “he smote the waters, and said: Where is the Lord God of Elias? and when he had stricken the,” &c. which removes the idea of presumption, which ( H.) some discover in the words of Eliseus. T. Sanctius.—*Now.* Heb. aph hu. Sept. αφφω, retaining the words which Theodotion renders “the hidden” god. H.—“Even he himself.” Aquila. C.—When I stand so much in need of his assistance, ( M.) having performed his important functions, which cannot be done without his spirit, nor without the confirmation of miracles, before an unbelieving people. H.  
**15** *They worshipped him;* viz. with an inferior, yet religious veneration, not for any temporal, but spiritual excellency. Ch. W.—They had stopped on a hill, ( M.) to see the event, v. 7. H.—Jericho itself is two hours’ journey from the Jordan. Adric.—The sons of the prophets had seen what had happened at the translation of Elias, and perceiving that Eliseus was invested with his mantle, and with the power of working miracles, they did not hesitate to acknowledge him for their superior, during the absence of Elias, who they expected would return. C.  
**16** *Valley.* It seems such translations were not uncommon. 3 K. 18:12. C.  
**17** *Send.* He acquiesces, lest they might think that he was afraid of losing his superiority. M.  
**19** *Barren*, owing to the salt or bituminous waters. Some think that they were muddy and of a loathsome smell. The fountain is still to be seen very abundant and excellent, watering the plain on the west of the city. Its source is about two miles distant on the road to Jerusalem. Maundrell, p. 134. C.—Other parts of the environs were very fertile. M.  
**20** *Put salt.* He removes ever suspicion of imposture: if the waters were already saline, the remedy would seem contrary to his design, but it would display the miracle in a stronger light; and if they were only fetid and muddy, ( C.) though ( H.) salt might rectify a small quantity, (Palladius tit. 9. Vales, &c.) it could never correct the bad qualities of such a fountain for a length of time, by the mere force of nature. H.—Josephus (Bel. iv. 8.) represents Eliseus acting like a magician, being desirous to please the pagan readers with various embellishments. C.  
**21** *Barrenness.* By the divine power they are become salubrious. H.  
**23** *Bald-head.* It is not know whether Eliseus was really bald, or only wore his hair short, like the priests of the Lord, and the monks at present. It may also be a term of reproach, of which the emperors Julius Cæsar, Domitian, and Otho, were very sensible. Cæsar wore a crown of laurel, and Otho a sort of false hair, to hide this deformity. Sueton.  
**24** *Cursed them.* This curse, which was followed by so visible a judgment of God, was not the effect of passion, or of a desire of revenging himself; but of zeal for religion, which was insulted by these boys, in the person of the prophet, and of a divine inspiration; God being determined to punish in this manner the inhabitants of Bethel, (the chief seat of the calf-worship) who had trained up their children in a prejudice against the true religion and its ministers. Ch.—The boys themselves were not so little as not to be aware of the insult they were offering to a minister of the God of Juda; and probably they acted thus out of hatred to him, at the instigation of their idolatrous parents. Sanc. C.—*Lord.* He called on him ( M.) to revenge his own cause, ( H.) “that the people might learn to take care of their souls, by the fear of death.” S. Aug. D.  
**25** *Carmel.* To avoid the indignation of the populace, and to instruct his disciples.—*Samaria.* That he might be ready to give advice to the two kings, who were meditating an expedition against Moab. M.  

---

## Chapter 3

**1** *Achab.* Joram succeeded his brother. C. 1:17.  
**2** *Baal.* This happened after his victory over Moab, v. 13. C.—Salien thinks rather that Josaphat refused to assist him, except he would destroy what had been lately introduced by his parents, as the league with Achab had been blamed. See 2 Par. 19:2. The golden calves were of an older standing, and could not be so easily taken from the people. M.—Joram was not so wicked as might have been expected. C.  
**4** *Nourished.* Hebrew noked, a term which the Sept. leave untranslated, means literally, “marked” with some colour by the master.  
**7** He entered cordially into this war, as he perceived that if Moab succeeded, Edom would follow the same plan. M.  
**8** Edom though more circuitous ( C.) than to cross over the Jordan at Galgal, as the enemy might this be taken unawares, ( M.) and fresh recruits might be procured from the tributary king of Edom, v. 9. H. Yet the want of water made this road more dangerous.  
**11** *Elias*, a proverbial expression to denote that he waited upon him, though the prophet’s rough manner of living would require but little attendance. So the Baptist speaks of untying our Saviour’s shoes, Mat. 3. C.—Providence had sent Eliseus to attend the army ( H.) contrary to his custom. C.  
**12** *With him* *.* I am content. H.—Others read with an interrogation, as if the reputation of Eliseus was not yet established. M.—*Him;* they go to his tent. No one ever supported the character of God’s envoy, or shewed his authority over the most haughty, better than Eliseus. C.  
**13** *Mother*, whom thou supportest. This is not an order, but a sarcasm ( H.) which the king deserved. C.—Christ said to Judas, *what th* *ou dost, do quickly*, John 13:27. H.—With what liberty does the prophet speak to an impious king! shewing himself worthy to succeed Elias, and actuated by the like zeal for God.  
**14** *Reverence*, (*er* *ubescerem*) “blush at,” may imply a degree of censure at Josaphat’s being again found in such bad company, v. 2. H.—Heb. “If I did not receive ( C.) or regard the face.” H.  
**15** *Minstrel.* The priests and Levites, who officiated in the temple, accompanied the army. Eliseus wants no profane music, ( C.) but, by this request, shews his respect for the true religion, ( H.) and by sounding forth the divine praises, in some of David’s psalms, wishes to obtain of God the favour which was desired. Theodoret. M.—He had felt some emotion at the sight of Joram, and was sensible that God required a calm. C.—He dwells not in a violent wind, &c. 3 K. 19:11. H.—The surprising effects of ancient music to calm the passions are well attested. 1 K. 16:17. By this means S. Francis was raised to the contemplation of heavenly things; and S. Augustine says of himself: “How I wept when I heard thy hymns and canticles, being greatly moved at the delightful harmony of thy church:” *suavesonantis Ecclesiæ tuæ voc* *ibus commotus acriter* *.* Conf. ix. 6. de C. xiv. 24.—*Upon him*, so that he experienced that enthusiasm which shewed that he was actuated by the divine spirit, to speak with all the authority requisite. The pagans strove to imitate the true prophets, but the difference was very evident; no less than the spirit with which they were filled; the former were agitated in a furious manner; the latter were composed and majestic. C.  
**16** *Ditches.* It was then quite dry; the water which should come in the night, would both refresh the army, and bring on the ruin of the Moabites.  
**19** *Tree.* This was an exception from the general law; (Deut. 20:19. C.) or it might only regard the land of Chanaan, which the Hebrews should occupy. M. W.—*Stones*, which had been gathered off into heaps. Isai. 5:1. Persius calls a field thus cleared, *Exossatus ager* *;* ( C.) as if the bones were taken out. H.  
**20** *Offered*, at sun-rise, Ex. 29:38.—*Water*, produced miraculously, without any rain being seen; (v. 17. C.) though it might fall at a distance in Idumea. H.  
**21** *Upon them.* Heb. “and upward,” both soldiers and those who were usually exempt from service.  
**22** *Blood.* The clouds have frequently a reddish colour at sun-rise, which would be reflected in the waters: the sand might also be red. As the Moabites knew that no water could be expected there at that season of the year, and as some examples had occurred of people turning their arms one against another in the night, (Judg. 7:11. 1 K. 14:20) they concluded that what they saw was blood. C.—God had also destined them for slaughter, (Abulens. q. 21.) and suffered their imagination and judgment to be deluded. H.  
**24** *Moab.* Heb. adds, “even in the country.”  
**25** *Brick walls.* It was the proper name of the city of the Moabites. In Hebrew, *Kir-Charaseth.* Ch.—Isai. 15 and 16:7. It was also called Ar, or Arcopolis.—*Remained.* Heb. adds, “with the stones unmolested.” They laid siege to it. H.—*Slingers.* Grotius would understand those who attended the machines designed to throw stones, &c. But the slingers kept off the enemy, while others undermined the walls. C.  
**26** Edom, hoping that he would favour their escape, or because that part seemed the weakest.  
**27** *Wall*, to Chamos, the idol of Moab; ( M.) or to Moloc, to appease the wrath of the gods. Horrible blindness! The pagans believed, that the most precious thing ought to be sacrificed in very imminent dangers. Philo Biblius. ap. Eus. præp. iv. 16.—The Phœnicians offered such victims to Saturn. Many devoted themselves to death for the safety of the Roman republic; and some were ready to do so, to preserve the lives of Caligula and Nero, before they had given proof of their evil dispositions. Seuton. xiv.—It s thought that Sennacherib intended to treat his two sons in this manner, if they had not prevented him. Abul. in 4 K. xix. 37.—Some imagine that Mesa sacrificed his son to the God of Israel, in imitation of Abraham; (Joseph. Grot.) others, that he slew the son of the king of Edom, out of revenge. Kimchi, in Amos ii. 1.—The Heb. is ambiguous. Amama.—But interpreters generally believe, that the heir of Mesa fell a victim ( C.) to his father’s mistaken zeal, or to his desire to make the enemy retire, when they saw him reduced to such a state of desperation. It had, at least, this effect. H.—*Indignation*, at such a cruel action. M.—Sept. “there was great repentance” and sorrow. The text may also imply, that God was displeased at Israel for pushing the king to such an extremity; or, they became an object of horror to the surrounding nations. C.—The first explanation seems the best; as the Israelites thought the king had been sufficiently punished, and therefore retired. They had no reason to suspect that he would have given way to such madness, nor were they to blame for it. H.

## Chapter 4

**1** *Prophets.* Josephus (ix. 4.) intimates that this man was Abdias; (3 K. 18:13) and the Rabbins pretend that Joram was the creditor. But these traditions are destitute of proof; and we know not that Abdias was a prophet. C.—*Serve him*, not as slaves, for the Hebrews were not thus to be sold, except they had commited some crime. Salien, A.C. 913. See Lev. 25:39.—But the condition of mercenaries was perhaps little different; ( H.) and we find that people were sold for debt. Ex. 21:7. Isai. 50:1. The same practice seems to have continued till our Saviour’s time. Matt. 18:25. Children were regarded as part of a person’s property. Halicar. ii. p. 96. Plut. in Solon et Luculls. The custom of selling children continued for a long time in our islands.  
**2** *Anoint me*, for delicacy or health. Matt. 6:17. M.—To abstain from this unction, in the East, was a great mortification. 2 K. 14:2. Deut. 28:40. Sanctius supposes, that the woman intended the oil to anoint her body for interment. Matt. 26:12. Heb. asuc, occurs no where else, and my signify *a pot*, or “skin of oil.” The woman had nothing else. The original does not say what she intended to do with it. C.—She might use it for food: (3 K. 17:12) but the Sept. agree with the Vulg. H.  
**6** *Stood.* The grace of God ceases to flow, when the soul is full of vanity. S. Bern.—Charity does not increase, when it bestows nothing. S. Aug. ser. 206. de Temp.  
**8** *Sunam*, the birth-place of the beautiful virgin Abisag, (3 K. 1:3) at the foot of Thabor, ( C.) and not above a mile from Carmel, v. 23. T.—*Great woman*, “renowned for piety” (Arab.) and riches, v. 13. T. M.—“Fearing sins.” Chal. This was true greatness! H.—Eliseus often passed by her house, when he went to visit the colleges at Bethel, Jericho, &c. M.  
**10** *Cham* *ber.* Heb. adds, “on the wall,” ( H.) or surrounded “with walls,” at the top of the house, where strangers usually lodged. C.—After being entertained the first day with the family, they might retire, and live, as if they were at home; some presents being sent to them daily, at least among the Greeks of rank. Vitruv. vi. 10.—The apartment of Eliseus might be separate from the house, that he might be less distracted in his meditations. M. Vatable.—*Candlestick*, on which many lamps, or even wood, might burn. Exod. 25:27. C.  
**13** *He said*, or “he had said;” (Junius and Piscator) so that we may include this and the following verse within a parenthesis, as alluding to what had passed before; ( C.) unless the woman, out of modesty, did not come into the chamber of the prophet, who addressed her by an interpreter, ( M.) or servant. H.—*Army.* Eliseus had acquired great influence with Joram, in the war with Moab. C.—The ancient canons exhort bishops to present the petitions of the poor to the prince. Grotius.—*People.* I have nothing to fear, ( H.) and am not in want. T.—I have no quarrel with any person. C.—I am of too mean a condition to have anything to do at court. Abul.  
**14** *No son.* The desire of one was very natural, particularly to people in good circumstances ( M.) and of the Hebrew nation. H.  
**16** *Womb.* Heb. “At this season, according to the time of life, ( H. *or* of a woman with child, M.) thou shalt embrace a son” in thy arms. H. See Gen. 18:10. C.—*If* is added by S. Jerom, agreeably to an usual form of speaking. M.—The prophet assures the woman, that she will not only live, but also bear a son, and nurse him.—*Lie*, deceive, (v. 28. H.) or flatter me with vain hopes. C. She might think that the prophet was not actually inspired. M.—Through joy, she could hardly believe. See Luke 24:41. H.  
**19** *Carry.* This interpretation suits with the occasion, and is conformable to the Sept. and Chal. M.—Lit. “conduct him,” but he was sick and little. H.  
**21** *Bed*, esteeming it as a relic, ( H.) or wishing to excite the man of God to pray for her child, and to conceal its death from her husband. M.  
**23** *Moon*, a day of devotion, (Num. 10:10. C.) or probably of obligation, like the *sabbath*, on which no long journey could be undertaken, ( T. v. 8.) unless for the sake of piety, (Ex. 26:8) as Sunam is a place six or seven leagues, ( C.) or eight hours’ walk from Carmel. Adrichom. M.—Piety was not so far decayed in Israel but many fervent souls still went to hear the prophets. C. It seems this woman had often made such journeys. M.—*Go.* Heb. “peace.” Prot. “*it shall be* well:” let me depart. She is unwilling to reveal the reason of her journey; but her husband was so well convinced of her virtue, that he placed no obstacle in her way. Perhaps he might partly guess what was the matter, as he had sent the child home sick, and saw his wife so desirous to visit the prophet. H.  
**24** *And do.* Heb. “unless I bid thee.” Some translate, “urge me not to get up, unless,” &c. Chal. Arab. &c. They suppose that she went on foot, and that the ass was designed for Eliseus. Vatab.  
**26** *Well.* She declines mentioning what she wanted to the servant, in order that she might speak to the prophet in person. M.—She might also rationally hope that the child was *well* in another world. H.  
**27** *Her.* Being aware of the extreme circumspection and modesty of his master.—*Told* *me.* Hence it appears that the prophets were not inspired at all times, 2 K. 7:3. “that they might be sensible that what they had was a gift of God.” S. Greg. hom. in 11 Ezech.  
**28** *A son.* Better had it been for me not to have become a mother, than to be so soon delivered of my child. M.  
**29** *Salute him not.* He that is sent to raise to life the sinner spiritually dead, must not suffer himself to be called off, or diverted from his enterprise, by the salutations or ceremonies of the world. Ch.—So must the preachers of the gospel diligently fulfil their important office. Luke 10:4. S. Greg. hom. 17. Urbanity is not reprehended; but no human transaction ought to impede what is divine. S. Amb. ib. In ancient comedies, slaves are always represented in a hurry. The Jews will not salute any person when they are going to their synagogues, for fear of being distracted in their devotions. C.—Eliseus requires the utmost expedition, that the favour might be the greater, *Qui cito dat, bis d* *at* *.* M.—He would also prevent his servant from telling any one what he was about, that he might not be touched with vanity, and thus hinder the miracle, which some think was nevertheless the case. R. Salomon. Theod. q. 17. T.  
**31** *The child is not risen.* By the staff of Eliseus is represented the rod of Moses, or the old law, which was incapable of restoring life to mankind, then dead by sin. It was necessary that Christ himself should come in our flesh, to restore us to life again. In this, Eliseus, as a figure of Christ, behoved to go in person to restore the dead child to life. Ch.—S. Aug. (c. Faust. xii. 35.) shews that many like things recorded in the Old Testament are figures of the New. W.—Many of the fathers observe, that this miracle was intended to shew the necessity of the Incarnation to redeem lost man. The staff did not therefore restore life. Some lay the blame on Giezi; others on the woman, who required the prophet to come in person; and others suppose that Eliseus followed herein his own spirit. But all this is destitute of proof. C.—He might alter his mind ( T.) at the request of the woman, and to imitate Elias; (3 K. 17:21) all by God’s direction. H.—He had before trusted that God would perform the miracle by means of the staff, as he did formerly by the rod of Moses, or by the mantle of Elias. M.  
**34** *Warm.* Arab. adds, “by his breath,” as when God breathed a soul into Adam. Theodor. q. 18.—Some Greek interpreters have, “he breathed upon him,” &c.  
**35** *Upon him.* Sept. “he breathed,” &c. C.—Other copies, (Alex. and Vat.) “he bent down upon the child seven times, and the child opened his eyes.”—*Gaped.* Prot. “sneezed;” ( H.) in which interpretation, Junius, Mont. &c. agree. Arab. “he turned his eyes about seven times.” Others, “he trembled,” ( C.) or sighed; ( M.) or Eliseus “clasped him in his arms,” &c. The child died of a headache; (v. 19.) and sneezing is accounted good for alleviating the pain. *Sternutamenta capitis gravedinem emendant* *.* Pliny xxviii. 6. C.  
**37** *Ground.* To honour the saint, who had done her such a kindness. M.  
**38** *Galgal*, where he had been often before.—*Dwelt.* Heb. “sat,” like disciples attending to the instructions of their master. Acts 22:3. C.—*To one*, &c. Heb. and Sept. “to his servant,” Giezi. M.—Eliseus provided for the temporal as well as for the spiritual wants of his followers. H.—The famine had been sent by God, to punish the idolatry of the people. C. 8:1. M.  
**39** *Wild herbs.* Heb. oroth. Sept. αριωθ, may denote any thing that could be “gathered.”—*Gourds: colocynthides.* They resembled cucumbers; but were so bitter, that they were styled, “the gall of the earth.” Vallesius, (Phil. c. 36.) who observes, that a small quantity may cause death, (c. 37.) and that the remedy used by the prophet was supernatural; though Lemnius (c. 7.) asserts, that the mixture of barley-flour would take away the bitterness. T.—It has, in effect, that tendency; but the hand of God must still be acknowledged. C.  
**40** *Death*, poison, &c. Matthiole accounts this fruit poisonous.  
**42** *Baalsalisa*, 15 miles south of Diospolis, and to the north of Jerusalem. C.—*His scrip.* Hebrew bctsiklono. Prot. “in the husk thereof.” *Carmel*, means a greenish ear of corn, ( H.) which might be rubbed in the hand, and so eaten. C.  
**43** *Men.* The disciples of Christ found the like difficulty. Jo. 6:9. M.—God multiplied the provisions for these 100 men, ( C.) living in the community at Galgal. H.

## Chapter 5

**1** *King*, Benadad, who had defeated Achab, and was slain by Hazael; (C. 8. T.) or, according to Salien, Hazael was already king. M.—Josephus passes over this history. It is not known for what reason, ( C.) unless he was staggered at the petition of Naaman, v. 18. 19. H.—*Syria.* The Rabbins say, by killing Achab. 3 K. 22:34. But their authority is very small; ( H.) and he might signalize himself on many other occasions.—*Leper.* This malady did not exclude him from court. The Hebrews allowed such to appear in public, till the priests had declared them unclean; and other nations viewed the leprosy with less horror.  
**2** *Robbers;* soldiers. T. 2 K. 4:2.—Such invaded the dominions of Joachin. C. 24:2. Irruptions of this nature were then very common, (see Judg. 11:3. Job 1:15) and regarded as noble military exploits. When the Greeks first became acquainted with navigation, they exercised themselves in this manner; (Thucyd. l.) and the Germans allowed their citizens to take from other people. *Juventutis exercendæ ac desidiæ minuendæ causâ* *.* Cæsar. Bel. Gal. vi. Those who had been plundered, were allowed to redeem their goods. Strabo xi.—The Arabs still maintain their right to live upon their neighbours. C.—The Christian religion has introduced more gentle manners.—*Maid.* It seems, however, she was well informed of the miraculous powers and goodness of Eliseus. H.  
**5** *Rai* *ment;* the tunic and the cloak, ( C.) of a finer sort. T.  
**7** *Leprosy.* The cure was deemed very difficult; as it generally kept gaining ground, and destroyed the constitution. See Num. 12:12. Isai. 53:4. C.—*Me.* The letter was, in effect, written in a haughty style, ( M.) and the king might naturally infer that war would be the consequence. H.  
**8** *Israel;* able to perform much greater wonders, by God’s assistance. M.  
**10** *Messenger.* Eliseus supports the dignity of God’s envoy, and shews the general that his cure was to be attributed, not to the presence of the prophet, but to the will and goodness of God.  
**12** *Pharphar* *.* Benjamin (p. 53) informs us that the former river serves to water the city, and the second the surrounding gardens. Maundrell could discover no vestiges of these names in Syria, but he describes the Barrady, which supplies Damascus with abundance of water. Stephanus calls it *Bardine;* and others, the Chrysorroas. The Orontes, which is supposed to be one of these rivers, flows by Antioch into the Mediterranean sea. C.  
**13** *Father;* a title given to masters, kings, &c. The Romans senators were styled, “conscript fathers;” and Homer calls kings “the fathers and shepherds of the people.” See Gen. 45:8. C.—Masters may often derive benefit from the observations of their servants, as Naaman did repeatedly, v. 2. This may serve to correct their pride. H.—*Cl* *ean.* The patient ought not to prescribe rules to his physician. M.—How justly might these words be addressed to delicate penitents! H.  
**14** *Clean.* If bathing seven times in the Jordan had been an infallible remedy, there would soon have been no lepers in the land; and our Saviour plainly intimates that the cure was miraculous. Luke 4:27. The leprosy of Naaman, though inveterate, was cured in an instant. To bathe in a rapid stream, is allowed to be very salutary for removing the diseases of the skin. C. Vales. 38.—The fathers discover in this miracle, a figure of the Gentiles called to the faith by the Synagogue, which is in servitude. Gal. 4:25. Baptism cleanses us from all the seven capital sins, (Tert. c. Marc. 4.) so that no vestiges remain. S. Amb. &c. C.  
**15** *A blessing.* A present, ( Ch.) accompanied with wishes of happiness, on both sides. We have seen that the prophets generally received such presents. But Eliseus acts with more reserve in regard of this stranger, as S. Paul did towards the new converts; though he received some sustenance from those, who would be less in danger of suspecting that he was actuated by selfish views in preaching the gospel. 2 Cor. 10:7 and 12:14. Matt. 10:8. C.—They abstained from every appearance of evil, ( H.) though they might lawfully have accepted such presents. Eliseus wished to convince Naaman that God’s grace was not to be purchased, and to leave a lesson of moderation to future teachers. M.  
**17** *Mule;* (*burdonum*,) the offspring of a horse and of an ass. M.—*Earth*, to make brick for an altar, or to inclose within a box of brass, as was done in the altar of holocausts in the desert; or, in fine, to sprinkle on some clean place, where an altar might be erected, in honour of the true God. He does not inquire what ceremonies were used in the land of Israel, ( C.) as he was not enrolled by circumcision, among the Hebrews, as an observer of their law; but intended to serve God, like Job, and many other righteous Gentiles, who kept themselves clear of idolatry, and observed the ancient patriarchal religion with a clean heart. H.—As God had sanctified the land by the observance of his true religion, Naaman rightly judged that it was fitter for an altar than the earth of his own country. W.—The Jews had a particular veneration for it. Ps. 101:15. They built a synagogue in Persia, with earth and stones taken from Jerusalem. Benjamin.—Christians sometimes carry away the same earth. S. Aug. de C. xxii. 8. Turon. i. 7.—The Donatists had a sovereign respect for it; (S. Aug. ep. 52.) and it is said that S. Helena brought a great quantity to the church of the Holy Cross of Jerusalem, at Rome. Mabillon, Itin. p. 187. C.—*Lord.* Out of Palestine, the Gentiles were not prohibited to offer sacrifice to the true God any where; nor were they under any obligation of following the law of Moses. Abulens. T.  
**18** *Remmon*, denotes “a pomegranate,” or something “elevated,” and is probably an epithet of the sun, the chief idol of the Syrians, which was also styled Adad, “one,” as both are united. Zach. 12:11.—*Rempham* is probably the same divinity. Acts 7:43. Sept. here read, Remman. Hesychius explains Ramas, “the highest god.” Selden thinks the *Elion* of the Phœnicians is understood; Grotius, that Saturn, the highest of the planets, is meant. Serarius declares for Venus, to whom pomegranates were sacred; and P. Martyr for Juno, who held one of these apples in her hand. Pausan. in Corinth.—Remmon occurs no where else.—*Hand.* This was an honour of the chief favourite. C. 7:2. C.—*Thing.* He does not ask leave to commit sin, which would be absurd; though Protestants are not ashamed to accuse the Catholic Church, as if her “indulgences” were pardons for sins to come; though they be in reality no pardon for sin at all, but only a remission of temporal punishment, after the sin has been remitted by penance. Why do they not manfully attack what we really profess to believe?—*When he.* Heb. “when I bow,” &c. H.  
**19** *Go in peace.* What the prophet here allowed, was not an outward conformity to an idolatrous worship, but only a service which by his office he cowed to his master; who, on all public occasions, leaned on him: so that his bowing down when his master bowed himself down, was not in effect adoring the idols; nor was it so understood by the standers by, (since he publicly professed himself a worshipper of the only true and living God) but it was no more than doing a civil office to the king, his master, whose leaning upon him obliged him to bow at the same time that he bowed. Ch.—Some assert that the prophet does not even authorize this civil assistance in the temple of idols, but simply tells Naaman to go in peace, and to think no more of his former religion; that he will beseech the Lord not to suffer him to be exposed to the danger. Jun. and Piscat. C.—Some formerly pleaded this example, to excuse their occasional conformity in going to the Protestant churches, as the law required. But the case was very different. Greater perfection is required in the new law. They had not to act in the capacity of Naaman; and their attendance was considered a profession of a false religion. Their directors loudly condemned the practice. They ought rather to have imitated Eleazar, &c. who refused to eat swine’s flesh. 2 Mac. 6 and 7. W.—Though the king intended to adore the idol, Naaman referred his worship, to God alone. Bristow, Mot. 23. Theodoret, q. 19 and a Greek interpreter.—The Heb. term signifies, either to adore mentally, or to bend down; which latter is the sense applicable to Naaman. Cajet. Amama.—His “request must certainly refer to the time past, and not to that to come; as if he begged an indulgence in idolatry, or of countenancing his master’s idol-worship, by his presence.” Button, Dict.—The Jews foolishly pretend ( C.) that “the proselyte of dwelling,” like Naaman, might return to the service of idols, in his own country, without its being imputed to him. Seld. Jur. ii. 11. Maimon.—The conduct of the Syrian convert, whether past or future, undoubtedly filled him with alarm. If he considered the danger of a merely civil attendance upon the king, in an idolatrous temple, we cannot condemn him for idle scrupulosity; ( H.) since many have found a difficulty in admitting the lawfulness of such a practice, and have even blamed both Naaman and the prophet. Greg. de Valentia, &c. ep. A. Lapide. C.—But if the practice was irreprehensible, as most interpreters assert, the answer of Eliseus might give this assurance to Naaman, and inform him that he need be under no farther apprehension on that account. *God in peace.* These words do not expressly solve the difficulty; but he mode in which they were uttered might intimate, either that the general would be no longer under that embarrassment, (as we do not read that he ever attended the king of Syria into the temple afterwards) or that God had forgiven his former offences, and particularly the scandalous idolatry which now gave him so much pain. The original, v. 18, which is generally translated in the present of future, ( H.) may be better rendered in the past tense, as the Chal. has it. “In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant. My master going into the temple of Remmon to worship there, and leaning upon my hand, and I worshipped in the temple of Remmon, when *I* did worship in the temple of Remmon, that the Lord pardon,” &c. S. Jerom and the Sept. seem to have read more correctly, *when he*, &c. We may also render it in the present tense, “and I worship,” or, “am wont to adore;” not that he meant to prevaricate any longer. The Syr. and Arab. read with an interrogation. “When I shall adore … ( C. or bow down, H.) wil the Lord pardon me?” But this rather increases the difficulty. C.—We may therefore conclude either that Naaman had no decision, or that he had leave to serve his master, ( H.) in a civil capacity even in the temple; ( M. T. Alex. 2. dis. 7. Santius, &c.) or, that he obtained pardon for his past transgressions. Bochart, C. &c.—*Earth*, as the expression is rendered Gen. 35:16, though here it is lit. “at the chosen season;” *electo*, not *verno* *.* The sense is the same. *Cibrath*, untranslated by the Sept. may denote a certain space, or village; ( H.) “a furrow,” of 240 feet long, and half that breadth; ( C.) “a mile;” (Chal. Pagnin) or a portion of time allowed by the law, about a quarter of an hour, during which a mile, or sabbath-day’s journey, might be performed. T.—Prot. “a little way.”  
**20** *Liveth.* How unnecessary was this oath! But the Simoniac has no regard for any thing but money. H.  
**23** *Him.* The weight must have been considerable, (6000 sicles, v. 26. Ex. 38:25. H.) otherwise Giezi would have preferred carrying them himself, that his master might not know. C.—He had pretended a reluctance to take more than one talent, not to swerve from his master’s injunctions. M.  
**24** *Evening.* Sept. Syr. &c. seems to have read *aupol*, instead of the present Heb. hopel, eminence,” ( C.) Prot. “tower,” ( H.) at or near Samaria; when Giezi thought proper to take the burden himself to prevent detection. Eliseus would hardly dismiss the Syrians, when the night was so near at hand. C.—It might however be found more eligible to travel in the evening, ( H.) as it was now the spring or summer season, ( T.) or at least warm, v. 10. H.  
**26** *Present* is not expressed in Heb. but must be understood. Prot. “Went not mine heart *with thee.*” H.—God has revealed the whole transaction to me. M.—*Heart* in Scripture, often denotes the spirit or soul. H.  
**27** *For ever.* Not perhaps to those who might be already born, unless they were accomplices in the crime. The leprosy is hereditary. Giezi was punished for simony, in selling the miracle, as well as for lying and disobedience. C.—He might also have given occasion to Naaman to judge ill of his master; as the false prophets were noted for such avarice. Mic. 3:11. But Eliseus would probably take care to give him better information. T.—He did not require his servant to give up what he had unjustly received, as the general had made over the property to him; and he thought proper to leave it in the hands of Giezi, to indemnity him for past services, and that he might have wherewith to support himself, as he now dismissed him from his company. Salien, A.C. 903.—*Snow*, and therefore more incurable. T.—See Lev. 13. C.—“All the covetous and misers, together with their riches, possess the leprosy of Giezi:” *thesaurum criminum congregarunt* *.* S. Amb. Giezi prefigured Judas, the false apostles of Christ, and all those who buy or sell spiritual things. By their avarice, they procure infamy in this world, and damnation in the next. S. Aug. ep. 208, de Temp. W.

## Chapter 6

**2** *Timber.* Heb. and Sept. “a beam.” Salien supposes that these prophets resided at Galgal. M.  
**5** *Borrowed.* He was grieved because he could not repair the loss. W.  
**6** *Swam.* So; *Demersam fluvio relevavit virga securim* *.* (Tert. c. Marc.) The Fathers here remark a figure of the cross of Jesus Christ; the virtue of which, in baptism, reclaims the hardened sinner from the ways of vanity. Tert. c. Judæos xiii. C.—Those who would explain the reason of every miracle, may here inform the infidel why recourse was had to a supernatural interference, in a matter apparently of such a trifling nature. They ask why God should cause the eyes of various pictures in Italy to *move* on a late occasion; and because they cannot assign a satisfactory reason, they boldly assert that all was an imposture. But this mode of argumentation is very delusive, if not impious. “*Who hat been his* (*God’s*) *counsellor?*” Rom. 11:34. All that we have to do is to believe, when the proofs are of such a nature as to require our rational assent.  
**8** *And such*, which the king would mention. M.—The causes of this war are not known; but an ambitious prince always finds pretexts to cover his injustice. C.  
**10** *Twice*, but very frequently: so that the Syrian feared some treachery. H.  
**12** *Chamber.* It is difficult therefore for the saints in heaven to hear our prayers? though they have not such long ears as Calvin ridicules. H.  
**13** *Take him.* Foolish attempt! as if the prophet could not foresee his own danger. Salien.—*Dothan* or *Dothain*, (Gen. 37:17) twelve miles north of Samaria. (Eus. C.) Andrichomius says, in the tribe of Zabulon. M.  
**14** *Of an*, or, “of *the* army.” To take one man was judged of such consequence; and Benadad feared lest the Israelites should rise up in his defence. H.  
**15** *Servant*, Giezi; as his leprosy is placed too soon. Salien. M.  
**17** *Of fire.* The angels assumed such a glorious and terrible appearance. One of them would have sufficed to destroy all the army of Syria; and thus the servant might be convinced how vain were all attempts against God’s servants, Psalm 144:19. Salien, A.C. Christ 907. Jacob beheld such camps of angels, (Gen. 32:1, 2.) and our Saviour speaks of the legions which he could have brought forward, Mat. 26:53. C.  
**18** *Blindness.* The blindness here spoken of was of a particular kind, which hindered them from seeing the objects that were really before them; and represented other different object to their imagination; so that they no longer perceived the city of Dothan, nor were able to know the person of Eliseus; but were easily led by him, whom they took to be another man, to Samaria. Sot that he truly told them; *this is not the way, neither is this the city*, &c. because he spoke with relation to *the way*, and to *the city* which was represented to them. Ch.—Stratagems in war are lawful. S. Chrys, &c. Grot. Jur. iii. 1. 17. The words of the prophet might be merely ironical.—*Blindness*, Sept. αορασια, “not seeing” certain objects, while they could perceive others; as was the case of the men who sought Lot’s door at Sodom; (Gen. 19:11. C.) and the eyes of the disciples were held, that they might not know our Saviour. Eliseus had left his house, going towards Samaria to meet the soldiers; and when they asked him where the prophet dwelt, he answered truly, *This*, &c. For he was then near the royal city, and is above was at Dothan. Salien. H.—The reprobate will thus acknowledge their error, when it is too late, at the last day.  
**22** *For thou.* Heb. “Dost thou kill, &c.?” If those who have surrendered themselves in battle be often spared, though they might be slain by the strict laws of war, how much less ought these men to be treated with such severity? C.—*Sicut bellanti & resistenti violentia re* *dditur: ita victo vel capto misericorida jam debetur* *.* S. Aug. ep. 1. ad Bonif. Grot.—*And water*, all necessary provisions. W.—These men were suffered to live that they might relate the wonders of God. Theod. q. 20.  
**23** *Meats.* So the apostle orders us to treat our enemies, Rom. 12:20.—*The robbers*, these soldiers, who were dismissed. H.—*No more*, (*ultra*) or, “no farther.” ( H.) during this war, or in small troops; but, a little later, Benadad came with all his forces to besiege Samaria. T.—He was enraged at Eliseus and Joram, as if they despised his power. Salien.  
**25** *In Samaria.* It had raged in all the country above three years, (Salien) and continued other four, C. 8:1. The continuance of the siege added fresh horrors.—*Pieces* is not expressed in Heb.: a sicle is understood. H.—Lyran supposes that the whole ass was sold for about 38 crowns, ( H.) or 130 livres; as we say commonly, “so much a head.” But interpreters generally assert that the price of the head alone is given; which shews more forcibly the greatness of the famine. On other occasions the animal could not be eaten by the Jews. Artaxerxes was forced to kill his beasts of burden; and an ass’s head was then sold for 60 drachms, or 25 livres. When Hannibal besieged Casilinum, a mouse (or rat) was sold for above 70, or for 200 denari. Plin. viii. 57. V. Max. vii. 6, 3.—*Cabe.* Sufficient measure of corn for a man’s daily sustenance. M.—The fourth part would be about a gill. H.—*Dung.* Bochart maintains that “chick-peas” are designated. The Arab. usnen and kali, “pigeon *or* sparrows’ dung,” are real eatables. Those who suppose that the Samaritans bought the dung of pigeons to use as salt or for food, or to burn, or to manure the earth, &c. produce not satisfactory reasons; no more than the Rabbins, who pretend that the corn which they had picked up was taken from their crop. Tr. Megil. 3. and the Schol. History. Junius and Fuller would translate “belly,” which is refuted by Bochart, Anim. T. ii. B. i. 7. Very disgusting things have often been used through extreme hunger, (Grot.) and some sort of birds’ dung is said to fatten oxen and swine, Varro 38. Pliny xvii. 9.—But what nutriment can there be in that of pigeons, that people should go to buy it? C.—Houbigant understands a sort of peas is meant. H.—The Hebrews called them kali when they were parched; and such food was very common. 2 K. 17:28. Bellon. ii. 53, and 99. C.  
**27** *Save* (*salvat* *.*) Many ancient MSS. read *salvet*, conformably to the Heb. and Sept. as if the king cursed the woman: “Let not the Lord save thee,” Joseph. ix. 4. Others place the stops differently: “He said, no: the Lord save thee.” C.—He is the author of life. M.  
**29** *Eat him.* Strange cruelty! foretold Deut. 28:53, and again verified at Jerusalem. Ezec. 5:10.  
**30** *Passed by*, without punishing such a horrid crime, as he esteemed his own sins the occasion of it. M.—*Flesh.* Behold the advantage to be derived from afflictions! They make the most hardened enter into sentiments of humility and penance. C.—Abulensis thinks that God was pleased to cause the siege to be raised, to reward this act; as a similar one of Joram’s father had merited a delay and mitigation of punishment, ( H.) 3 K. 21:27. Salien.  
**31** *Day.* This was said in a fit of sudden passion, which may give us reason to conclude that the repentance was insincere, or of short duration. H.—The king supposed that he Eliseus could remedy the evil: but God was not moved by his prayers to grant such a favour, till all were convinced that human aid was fruitless. C.—The prophet might have answered Joram in the words of Elias, 3 K. 18:18. M.—Probably he had dissuaded the king from making peace. T.  
**32** *Murderer.* Achab had slain Naboth, and Jezabel had destroyed the prophets. C.  
**33** *And* *he*, Joram, ( M. &c.) after ( H.) his messenger. E. Pisc.—*What*, &c. All is desperate; ( C.) our miseries cannot increase. M.—I have nothing now to fear or to hope for. Salien.

## Chapter 7

**1** *A stater.* It is the same as a sicle or shekel. Ch.—As it is in Heb. and Sept.—*Bushel*, or “measure,” H. above 9 pints.—*Gate*, where the market place commonly was. C.  
**2** *Lords.* Heb. shalish, “an officer” of the first rank, Ex. 14:7. Sept. τριστατης, which Josephus explains of one who “commands a third part of the army.” C.—*Flood-gates.* If corn should fall with the same abundance as water does from the cataracts of the Nile; or, Heb. “if the Lord should make windows,” &c. to pour it down, ( C.) could it possibly be so cheap? M.—*Thereof.* Thus his incredulity was punished, v. 17. Salien.—Reason must not pretend to reach the power of God, but ought to believe what he says. W.  
**3** *Lepers.* They were excluded from society, though the laws of religion were ill observed in Israel. The Rabbins say, these four were Giezi and his three sons. C.—But this is without foundation, ( H.) as Giezi was not yet a leper. C. 8:5.—Salien places that judgment two years later. H.  
**5** *E* *vening.* Heb. “twilight.”—*First part*, where the advanced guard should be, or the nearest tents.  
**6** *Hethites.* Sept. “Chetteans.” Joseph. “the islands” of Cyprus, &c. He seems to have read *Cethim* in the text, as they peopled Cyprus. C.—See Jer. 2:10. M.—These Hethites seem to have dwelt in the stony Arabia, (Judg. 1:26) or in Syria. H.—Solomon had connexions with them, 3 K. 10:29. C.—Angels made *the noise* of a mighty army, and probably appeared, as they had done to Giezi. C. 6:17. T.  
**9** *Crime*, and punished. Heb. “iniquity shall find us.” Citizens are bound to give notice of what may tend to the common good. C.—*Court.* Not in person, but by means of others. M.  
**10** *Tied* to the mangers, or rather by the hind-legs, as it is still the custom in the East. Xenop. Anab. iii. Martyr legat. Babyl.  
**13** *Consumed*, for food. M.—Sept. “Let them take five of the horses left. Those which are left here, behold they are to all the remaining multitude of Israel, and let us send them.” They have read in a different manner from the present Heb. which has, “Let them take five of the horses there remaining; behold they are like all the multitude of Israel who are lost; let us send them.” Arab. “Let us send thither five horsemen who remain; if they escape, we shall look upon them as those Israelites who continue alive; if they perish, they well be numbered with the other Israelites who are dead.” Both horses and horsemen were dreadfully lean, and they could not expect a better fate than those already consumed by famine. C.—The truth of the report ought at least to be fully ascertained. By following the timid advice of the king no prospect of redress appeared. At last the king consented to send two horsemen. H. Sept. v. 14. Jun. &c.  
**14** *Horses.* Heb. “chariot horses,” or two chariots with (each) two horses, as it was customary to go to war, and to travel on chariots. C.  
**17** *Gate*, to prevent confusion and accidents, (Josephus) or to guard against any return of the enemy. M.

## Chapter 8

**1** *Famine.* God disposes of all things. C.—Famine, &c. are his executioners. D.—This dreadful visitation took place before the siege of Samaria, (Salien) and had even commenced when Eliseus raise the child to life; (C. 4:38) so that we might translate, “Eliseus had spoken,” &c. C.  
**3** *Lands*, which others had seized. D.  
**4** *Giezi* was not yet infected; (Salien. M.) or if he was, ( H.) the king spoke to him at a distance, overcoming his natural repugnance, in order to know some particulars of the life of Eliseus. C.—This he would more readily do, if Giezi had brought the glad tidings of plenty. T.—Providence ordered that he should be present at this time, that he might bear witness to the woman. C.  
**6** *Restore.* “*Restituere est possessorem facere fructusque reddere* *.*” Caius.—Some think that the lands had been confiscated to the king, as being abandoned; or his authority was requisite, at least, to make the present occupiers give them up.  
**7** *Damascus*, the territory, (v. 8.) to announce the king’s death, and to anoint Hazael, as God had ordered Elias, 3 K. 19:15. C.—*Sick*, at the ill success of his late expedition. Josephus. T.  
**9** *Camels.* It does not appear that Eliseus rejected these presents. M.—*Thy son.* The kings of Israel and Juda styled the prophet father, and this title was given by Christians of antiquity to bishops and priests.  
**10** *Tell h* *im: Thou shalt recover.* By these words the prophet signified that the king’s disease was not mortal: and that he would recover, if no violence were used. Or he might only express himself in this manner, by way of giving Hazael to understand that he knew both what he would say and do; that he would indeed tell the king he should recover, but would be himself the instrument of his death. Ch.—The imperative is often used for the future tense. Gloss iii. 3. Jo. 2:19. The present Heb. reads, “Thou shalt not live: for,” &c. which removes the difficulty. But the Chal. Sept. Syr. &c. agree with the Vulgate, ( C.) as the Prot. version also does. “Thou mayst certainly recover, howbeit the Lord,” &c. H.—Lo, “not,” in the Heb. text, seems however preferable to the marginal reading, lu, “to him.” This mistake has been sometimes made elsewhere, and ought to be carefully examined. Kennicott 1 Par. 11:20.  
**11** *Blush.* This may be referred either to Hazael, who was astonished at the words and looks of the prophet, ( H.) or to Eliseus. M.—Sept. Complut. “and Hazael stood before his face, and he displayed the presents before him, till he blushed, and the,” &c. Though this has the appearance of a gloss, it is perhaps more conformable to the Heb. and to an ancient Greek version. C.—Prot. “he settled his countenance steadfastly, until he was ashamed.”  
**13** *A dog.* He speaks with indignation, as if he could not be so brutal; ( T.) or he could not yet think that he should be king. C.—He afterwards proved as cruel as the prophet had signified. C. 10:32. Amos 1:3. C.  
**15** *Blanket.* Heb. macber, a word which the Sept. retain. H.—It denotes a hairy coverlet, pillow, &c. Tiberius and Frederic II. met with the like fate. C.—Some think that Hazael was only guilty of imprudence; ( M.) or that Benadad killed himself; as the Heb. might be rendered, if the sequel did not evince that his death was caused by Hazael’s malice. C.—He might pretend that the wet cloth would give Benadad refreshment. H.—But it would bring on present death, with most exquisite torture. T.—The names of both these kings were in great veneration among the Syrians, who paid them divine honours. Joseph. ix. 4.—Perhaps they might not know that the latter had been guilty of such a base murder. H.  
**16** *Fifth.* Houbigant would read “third,” p. 100. See C. 1:17. H.—*Josaphat.* That is, Josaphat being yet alive, who some time before his death made his son Joram king; as David had done before by his son Solomon. Ch.—The words are omitted in some copies of the Sept. ( D.) and are perhaps inserted from the end of the verse. H.—Prot. “Jehosaphat *being* then king,” in his 22d year. H.—Joram had been appointed viceroy in the sixteenth year of his father’s reign, and was now raised to sit on the throne with him. Thus the Scripture may be reconciled. C.  
**18** *Achab*, Athalia. She led her husband into all wickedness. T. 2 Par. 21.  
**19** *Light*, or lamp, posterity and regal power, 3 K. 11:36. H.  
**20** *King.* The one under Josaphat was dependant, C. 3:9. 3 K. 22:48. Thus the prediction of Jacob was verified, (Gen. 27:40. C.) and Joram punished. H.  
**21** *Seira*, or Idumea. Gen. 14:6.—*Defeated.* The Syriac and Arab. explain it in a contrary sense, as the Heb. may well signify, and the sequel seems to prove, as the Edomites became independent. Heb. “He rose … and attacked Edom that surrounded him, (with superior numbers) and the princes … and the people (of Israel) fled.” But the text will also bear the sense of the Vulg. which is conformable to 2 Par. 21:9, which does not say *the people*, &c. though these words may be understood of the Edomites. Joram could not derive such advantage from his victory, as to reduce the nation under his obedience. C.  
**22** *Day*, when Jeremias, the author lived. Tostat.—*Lo* *bna*, a frontier town bordering on Idumea. It was a strong place assigned to priests; but strangers had probably again taken possession of it, and caused it now to revolt. The kings of Juda had retaken it when Sennacherib laid siege to the place. See C. 19:8. Josue 10:30 and 21:13.  
**24** *Slept*, after a lingering and painful illness of two years’ continuance. Joram was not buried in the tomb of the other kings, nor were perfumes burnt over his corpse; ( C.) as his memory was abhorred. 2 Par. 21.  
**25** *Twelfth*, more correctly than “the eleventh.” C. 9:29. Houbigant.  
**26** *Twenty.* In 2 Paral. 22:2, we read *forty*, by mistake of the transcribers, as Ochozias, (Joachaz, or Azarias, 2 Par. 21:17) would thus be older than his father, who died at the age of forty. 2 Par. 21:20. All the original versions, and many copies of the Sept. read “twenty-two” in both passages; and those who would admit no mistake, are forced to have recourse to explanations which can give no satisfaction. De Dieu would include in the reign of Ochozias the six years of Athalia’s usurpation, and the thirteen of Joas, during his minority. Others would date from the separation of the two kingdoms, &c. But would the Holy Ghost cause the same fact to be recorded in two places in such a different manner? The best chronologists acknowledge a mistake in the Hebrew text of Paral. (Cajet. Salien, Petau, T. &c. C.) as the letters which denote these numbers are not unlike (Mariana:) *c* (20) might easily be exchanged for *m* (40.) H.—*Daughter.* That is, grand-daughter; for she was daughter of Achab, son of Amri, v. 18. ( Ch.) unless she was only adopted by Achab. W.  
**28** *Galaad.* The same city had proved fatal to Achab, 3 K. 22. Joram took it, but received ( C.) many wounds; so that he left Jehu to attack the citadel. The latter was anointed king, and acknowledged by the army. He immediately proceeded to Jezrahel, and put his master to death. H.

## Chapter 9

**1** *One.* The Rabbins say Jonas; who at this rate, must have been very young, as he prophesied 50 years afterwards, under Jeroboam II. C.—Eliseus did not go himself, to avoid giving umbrage, and in obedience to God’s order. M.  
**2** *Brethren.* The captains, v. 5.  
**3** *Bottle.* See 1 K. 10:1. Elias had received orders to anoint Jehu, 3 K. 19:16. C.—*There.* The utmost expedition was necessary, that Joram might be surprised, as well as Ochozias, and their devoted families. M.  
**7** *Jezabel*, who had persecuted the prophets unto death, 3 K. 18:4.  
**8** *Israel.* See Deut. 32:36 and 3 K. 14:10 for an explanation of these expressions. C.  
**10** *Field*, between the inner and the outer wall. Her body shall be left exposed to be eaten by the dogs.  
**11** *Madman.* The extravagant motions of the false prophets caused even the true ones to be treated with contempt. Warriors are but too apt to give way to sentiments of irreligion, ( M.) and to despise men who lead a retired and penitential life. H.—How often were Ezechiel and Jeremias treated as fools, (Ezec. 33:30. Jeremias 29:26. C.) as well as our divine Saviour? The pagans looked upon those who were inspired by Apollo in the same light. H.—*Ut primum cessit furor & rabida ora quierunt*, Virg. Æneid vi. “What authority has this fury, which you call divine, that the insane should behold what escapes the observation of the wise, and that he who has lost common (human) sense should possess divine?” *ea videat insanus, & is qui humanos sensus amiserit, divinos assecutus sit?* Cicero Divin. ii.  
**12** *False.* We know not who he was, or what he said; though, from his conduct, we judge that he was one of the prophets. Hence they so readily acquiesced in saluting Jehu king. H.  
**13** *Garment*, out of respect, as the multitude honoured Jesus Christ, Mat. 21:7. The pagans sometimes did the like when they carried their idols in procession. Plut. in Alcib. The king of Persia walked on carpets in the court of the guards, who were styled immortal. Athen. 12.—*Trumpet*, according to custom, 3 K. 1:40. C.  
**14** *Conspired*, with the captains. M.—Besieged, as it is observed above. C. 25:29. Heb. “had kept ( H.) or observed;” watching the motions of Hazael, lest he should return, or succour the citadel.  
**17** *Watchman.* Such were very common, (2 K. 18:24. 1 Mac. 12:26) and as the army was at Ramoth, the attention of the people would be drawn that way. C.—*Troop.* Sept. “the dust of the,” &c. M.  
**18** *Peace?* As this expression sufficiently vindicated the designs of Jehu, he would not suffer the messenger to return before him. H.  
**20** *Furiously.* The Chal. and Arab. say, “he marcheth slowly.” But the whole conduct of Jehu was marked with eagerness and severity, like that of Cato of Utica, (Grotius) and the utmost expedition was requisite.  
**22** *Jehu?* The king supposed that he had meet with some defeat, ( C.) of that he wished to announce the good tidings in person. M. Salien, A.C. 902.—*Vigour?* How can Israel prosper? H.  
**23** *Hand.* Or ordered his charioteer to flee with all speed. M.  
**25** *Sitting.* Heb. “rode together after,” as if they were two abreast. C.—*Burden*, or dreadful misfortune. M.  
**26** **Ver** **.** **26** **.** *Children.* We do not read these words before, or that the children of Naboth were slain; but it is very usual to supply in one place what has been omitted in another, and Achab was not required to make restitution, ( C.) as there were no heirs probably left. M. W.  
**27** *House.* Sept. retain “Baithgan,” the original term, as if it were the name of that road. M.—Ochozias wanted to reach the palace by the garden, which was the source of the miseries of Achab’s family.—*There.* Being brought back from *Samaria*, 2 Par. 22:9. ( C.) or lurking in that *kingdom*, ( M.) and slain by Jehu as being the grandson of Jezabel. Great troubles took place in Juda, in consequence of his death. C.  
**29** *Eleventh*, or rather the *twelfth*, (C. 8:25. Houbigant) unless he had been associated with his father on the throne a year before his death. C. D.  
**30** *Stone*, or antimony, to make the eyes look black and large. If ( C.) Jezabel thought that she would thus command respect or love, (Abulensis) she was extremely imprudent and rash, in her present condition. Pride might suggest that she ought not to appear unadorned. C. T.—The women of the Eastern countries delight much in painting, (Pliny xi. 37. and xxxiii. 6.) and some men have not been ashamed to follow their example. S. Cyp.—Sardanapalus had his eyes and his eye-lids painted. Athen. xii. The Arabs, &c. think that this black colour protects the eyes against the sun-beams. Valle ii. Ep. 17. To express the affection of Jezabel, Heb. has, “she placed her eyes in antimony,” (*fuc*, or *puc*, whence the Latin *fucus* is visibly derived) as if she plunged them in it. C.  
**31** *Master.* Being convinced that she could not gain the affections of Jehu, ( H.) and thinking that he would not lay hands on a woman, ( M.) she insolently, or in despair, ( H.) upbraids him as a new Zambri, who might expect a similar fate, 3 K. 16. C.—The name of *Zambri* was used proverbially to denote an ungrateful rebel; as with us Judas is used for a traitor. T.  
**32** *Thi* *s.* “Who dares address me with such provoking language?” Heb. “Who with me, who?” will punish the wretch? The *eunuchs*, who had hitherto waited upon Jezabel, immediately shewed their readiness to take part with her enemy: so little dependence can be placed on servants in the hour of adversity, when they have long been witnesses of their masters’ crimes.—*Hoofs.* Heb. “and the horses, and he trod her under foot.” H.—Jehu shewed the example. M.  
**34** *Bury.* He had forgotten the prediction of Elias, v. 36. Salien.—*Daughter* of Ethbaal, wife of Achab, mother of Joram king of Israel, and mother-in-law of Joram king of Juda, and grandmother of his son Ochozias. C.—Her great connexions seemed to entitle her to the rights of sepulture. H.  
**35** *Hands.* All the rest had been presently devoured, or carried off by dogs. H.—Her precious jewels had been plundered by the soldiers. M.  
**36** *Field*, or space between the walls, 3 K. 21:23. C.  
**37** *Jezabel?* So fallen ( M.) and degraded, though once possessed of so much power and beauty! *sic transit gloria mundi* *.* Heb. and Sept. “that they shall not say, This *is* Jezabel!” H.—No monument shall recall her to the remembrance of men. C.—Her body cannot be recognized. This will be the fate of the greatest mortal beauties, a few days after their departure. S. Francis Borgia durst not take an oath that the corpse which he had to attend, was that of the late beautiful empress Isabella: so much was it already disfigured. This sight was the beginning of his conversion, and of that eminent sanctity to which he attained, by despising all that the world can give or take away. H.—The Spanish interpreters call Achab’s widow, Isabella: and she seems to have been the sister, or relation, of Dido, who founded Carthage about this time; ( T.) Salien says in the 16th year of Jehu. A.C. 887. H.

## Chapter 10

**1** *Seventy sons*, as he had many wives. Gedeon had 70. C.—Grand-children might also be included. D.—But this is not necessary. C.—*City*, Heb. “of Jezrahel,” a word which has probably been substituted instead of “Israel,” which is more conformable to the Sept. and Vulg. Those who adhere to the Heb. pretend that the princes had all fled from Jezrahel.—*Children.* This is the sense generally given to *Nutritios Achab*, which literally signifies, “nursing-fathers (preceptors, counsellors, &c.) of Achab,” v. 5. The king’s children were perhaps educated in the most noble families, (v. 6.) and in the best cities, 2 Par. 11:23. Isaias (49:23) foretelling the happiness of the Israelites after the captivity, says, that kings and queens will nurse them.  
**3** *Master.* Jehu would lead them into a snare, and insultingly challenges them to battle, shewing how little he feared their power. C.—He speaks ironically. D.  
**8** *Morning*, that all the people might see them. C.—Jehu did not choose to admit the Samaritans into the city during the night. M.  
**9** *Just* executioners of the divine wrath. D.—You know what is right. M.—You are now in the same predicament with myself. H.—All the chief men had thus rendered themselves odious to the people, who could not choose them for leaders. He captiously infers, from his astonishing success, ( C.) that his conduct is pleasing to God. M.—All the people seeing that so many had armed ( T.) against the house of Achab, might conclude that what they did was just. H.  
**11** *Chief men*, probably including those perfidious wretches, who had so basely betrayed their trust, and slain the 70 sons of Achab, “the nobles of the kingdom, his kinsmen, and friends.” Chal. Arab.—*Friends.* Some copies of the Sept. have *connoisseurs*, of magicians. Lev. 19:31.—*Priests*, princes of the court (2 K. 8:18) and those who offered sacrifice to idols, ( C.) being of Achab’s descendants. M.—He afterwards inveigled all the priests of Baal, to their entire ruin, v. 19. H.  
**12** *Cabin.* Heb. Beth-heked, ( H.) a term which the Sept. do not translate. It means, “house of tying,” as the sheep were tied to be shorn. M.—Eusebius places it in the great plain, 15 miles from Legion. C.—It was not a despicable hut, ( H.) but like the houses where Nabal and Absalom shore their sheep, 1 K. 25. &c. T.  
**13** *Brethren.* The Arabs had destroyed all his brothers by the same mother; (2 Par. 22:1) but these were near relations, and they durst not deny the fact. M.—In 2 Par. 22:8, they are styled *princes of Juda, and sons of the brethren of Ochozias.* Jehu must have used surprising diligence ( C.) and secrecy ( H.) to prevent the many important transactions and changes which had lately taken place from being known at Jerusalem, or even at Bethheked, v. 12 which was so little distant from Samaria. C.—*Queen.* The wife of Joram, or the children of Jezabel, ( M.) with whom they were connected by affinity and friendship, to their great detriment. H.  
**14** *Alive.* That they might not attempt to defend themselves, ( M.) as they might hope that Jehu would, at least, spare their lives. H.—*Of them*, as they were in some degree related to Achab, ( M.) or might endeavour to obstruct his dominion. T.  
**15** *Jonadab*, a holy personage. Jer. 35:6. The Rechabites were a sort of religious, descended from Jethro and the Cinites. C.—They dwelt in the country, and fed sheep, &c. Num. 10:29. T.—John of Jerus. (c. 25.) says that Jonadab was a disciple of Eliseus, and followed his institute in all things, except continency. M.—*Blessed him*, wishing his peace and prosperity. M.—It is not clear whether Jehu or Jonadab pronounced this blessing. H.—*Heart.* Art thou friendly to my cause?—*Thy hand*, in sign of concord, and to help him up into his chariot. C.—It was of great consequence to obtain the approbation of a man H. who must have been so revered by the people. M.—Jehu acted with the utmost policy. H.  
**18** *I will worship him more.* Jehu sinned in thus pretending to worship Baal, and causing sacrifices to be offered to him: because evil in not to be done, that good may come of it. Rom. 3:8. Ch. W.—S. Jerom, &c. excuse him from mortal sin, as his intention was good. T.—If he had not thus dissembled, he could not have so effectually destroyed the adorers of Baal, who would have concealed themselves. But God rewarded his zeal, and not his falsehood. C.—He might speak ironically; though Theodoret, &c. admit a lie. M.  
**19** *Servants.* The number had greatly decreased under Joram. M.  
**20** *Proclaim.* Lit. “sanctify (Heb.) a prohibition” to work, or to be absent, ( C.) “and they proclaimed *it.*”  
**21** *Other.* Lit. “from top to top.” Heb. “from mouth to mouth,” H. like a vessel brimfull. C.—Every corner was filled. All the priests and prophets made their appearance, through zeal to re-establish the honour of their idol, and for fear of death. M.  
**22** *Wardrobe*, of vestments used in the service of Baal. The worship chiefly consisted in such outward pomp. The priests were probably adorned like those at the pillars of Hercules, who were from the same country. Sil. Ital. iii. *velantur corpora lino, &c.*  
**24** *Life.* These 80 were stationed at the doors, while the rest slaughtered the unhappy idolaters, ( M.) who were all by themselves, like the reprobate separated from the elect, at the last day. H.  
**25** *Soldiers.* Heb. “runners, (or foot-guards, 3 K. 1:5,) and chief officers.” Ex. 14:7.—*Out.* Heb. “cast out” their carcasses, or “rushed out (themselves) into the city,” which was styled “the temple of Baal;” or “penetrated into the fortress” and inmost recesses of that structure. Osiander.—We read of such a fortress. Judg. 9:46. H.—In every city where there was a temple of Baal, the fabric and idols were demolished. Salien.  
**27** *A jakes*, or necessary. H.—See 1 Esd. 6:11. Dan. 2:5.  
**29** *Dan.* This wicked policy, which was designed to prevent his subjects from submitting again to the kings of Juda, proved his ruin.  
**30** *Generat* *ion.* So Joachaz, Joas, Jeroboam II. and Zacharias, succeeded to the throne. This small temporal reward he obtained for the little good which he had done; while, on the other hand, he was punished for his manifold transgressions. Osee (1:4,) reproaches him even for the blood which he had spilt in Jezrahel; for, though Achab and Joram were guilty, was Jehu innocent? Can this murder of Ochozias be justified? C.—“What advantage was it to him that he received some little transitory reward of a temporal kingdom, for his obedience in exterminating the house of Achab; which he indeed exhibited to gratify his own lust of dominion?” S. Aug. c. mend. ii. c. 2. This holy doctor observes, that *moral good works* are thus rewarded. W.  
**32** *Weary.* Heb. “to retrench or destroy.” Hazael took occasion, from the absence of Jehu ( C.) from Galaad, and the disturbances on the west of the Jordan, to dismember the provinces on the east, and to commit the horrid ravages foretold by Eliseus. C. 8:12. H.  
**33** *Aroer.* See Jos. 13:25. This was a most severe scourge, ( M.) as all the eastern tribes were lost to Israel. H.

## Chapter 11

**1** *Seed.* What cruelties are occasioned by ambition! W.—This is one of the most extraordinary proofs recorded in history. Agrippina was but a faint copy of the unnatural Athalia, ( C.) who knew that she was destined for slaughter, if she should fall into the hands of Jehu. M.—Her impiety might also prompt her to destroy all the posterity of David, that she might introduce the worship of idols more easily. Theodoret.  
**2** *Sister.* She had probably a different mother, as she consented to the death of Athalia. C.—But the crimes of the latter require such a punishment; and even a daughter would have done wrong to screen her. H.—Josabeth, as she is called in 2 Par. 22:11, was married to Joiada the high priest, *ibid.*—*Out of.* Heb. and Paral. “hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bed-chamber” of the priest, in the temple; (Salien) different from that bed-chamber in which he had hitherto been nursed. Thus the passage may be reconciled. M. C.—Some maintain that Joas was not the son of Ochozias, in whom the line of Solomon ended, but a descendant of David by Nathan. But he is always styled the king’s son, and the authority of the false Philo of Annius is of no weight. C.—Joiada is called Barachias, “blessed of the Lord,” on account of his justice, (S. Jer.) in Mat. 23.  
**3** *Lord.* The case was so extraordinary, that he high priest dispensed with a woman lodging in those apartments.—*Land*, for six years, by usurpation. Women were commonly excluded, and she was not of the race of David, 4 K. 8:26. C.  
**4** *Year*, of the age of Joas, v. 21. M.—*Centurions.* Five in number of the tribe of Levi, ( M.) commanding each 100 men. Heb adds “the rams,” ( C.) to denote “the captains (Prot.) and the runners,” or guards. H.—Joiada was a man of great authority, virtue and discretion; so that he was able to manage this delicate affair, and no one gave information to Athalia, as she was detested. The Levites and principal men of Juda were admonished, underhand, to be present on the day appointed. The quality of high priest, and the known probity and zeal for the public good, which were conspicuous in Joiada, as well as his being so nearly related to the lawful heir to the crown, made the people readily come forward. C.  
**6** *Sabbath.* On this day the Levites replaced each other; so that many might assemble without suspicion. They guarded the king’s apartments in the temple.—*The gate of Sur*, or *of the foundation*, (2 Par. 23:5) and the western gate leading to the palace. C.—*Sur*, or “the gate of the lords,” (Chal.) is generally supposed to be on the opposite side. M.—But this is uncertain, as well as the situation of *Messa*, which is perhaps the Musach. C. 16:18. This was probably some building or covert adjoining the temple, ( C.) either belonging to some private person, ( M.) or designed to contain the ashes, &c. taken from the temple; (Villalp. ii. 32.) or a tribune for the king in the temple. H.—The Chaldee seems to have explained it as an adverb, *sollicite*, “with diligence,” ( M.) as well as the Sept. ( D.) which is consonant to Vatable; you shall guard the house “from desertion.” Let no one quit his post. M.  
**7** *Of you.* Levites, who waited on the king’s person alternately. C.—They were divided into three parts, being in actual service, v. 6. Those who went out of office were twice the number, and are here told what to do. Sa thinks that those who entered upon duty, and those who went out, formed two thirds of the Levites, v. 9 and 2 Par. 23:8. M.  
**8** *Temple*, to cause confusion, Syr. &c. The court of the priests, (Ezec. 41:9) and that of Israel, (Josep. viii. 4.) were separated by walls, beyond which strangers were not allowed to pass. C.—*Slain*, being first cast out, v. 15. M.—Great respect is due to holy places, and hence comes the privilege of sanctuaries. W.  
**10** *David.* There was a sort of arsenal in the temple, containing arms consecrated to the Lord by David and his valiant men, in memory of their victories, 2 K. 8:11. 1 Par. 18:11. The usual band of Levites had proper arms, but more were employed on this occasion. C.  
**11** *Right*, or south, leading to the palace, ( M.) whence the greatest danger was feared. C.—*Altar* of holocausts, that it might not impede the sight of the king. M.  
**12** *The testimony.* The book of the law. Ch.—So Job (31:35, 36) wished to have the sentence pronounced by God as a crown upon his head. The Orientals still lift to their heads the letters which they have received from people whom they wish to honour. Thevenot, 46.—Some think that the diadem was adorned with phylacteries, or scrolls, containing parts of the law, (Grot.) particularly what related to the king; ( H.) or that Joas held in his hand a roll of vellum, containing those instructions, (Deut. 17:18. 2 Par. 23:11) instead of a sceptre.—*Anointed him*, by the hands of Joiada; as this ceremony was requisite on account of the usurpation of Athalia. In peaceable times the unction was not given, ( C.) according to the Jews, ( H.) whose sentiment is elsewhere shewn to be unsatisfactory. C.  
**13** *Going in.* She must have been attended by a strong guard, to force the passage through the Levites at the door. H.  
**14** *A tr* *ibunal.* A tribune, or place elevated above the rest. Ch.—Heb. “on a pillar.” Solomon had stood upon one of brass, three cubits high and five broad. See C. 23:3. and 2 Par. 6:13.  
**15** *Precinct.* Heb. sederoth, (untranslated by the Sept. and ( H.) improperly supposed by Josephus to be the torrent Cedron) means, “the ranks” of the guards, ( C.) or, “ranges” of the sacred buildings, which her impure blood must not defile. H.—*Follow her*, as an accomplice. M.  
**16** *Thrust.* Heb. “and she went by the way by which the horses enter the king’s house. When she was come within the horse-gate of the palace, they killed her there.” 2 Par. 23:15. Such was the ignominious end of this true daughter of Jezabel! H.  
**17** *People.* Joiada, as mediator ( C.) between God, the king, and the people, engaged the two latter to be faithful to their common Lord, and to each other. They promised mutually to observe the laws, and, on that condition, the high priest gave them an assurance that God would protect them. H.—The covenant entered into by their fathers (Ex. 19:5) was renewed. C.  
**18** *Altar.* Many of the sacred ornaments belonging to the temple had been transported to the house of Baal, probably on Mount Olivet, where Solomon had formerly erected such buildings. 3 K. 11:5. 2 Par. 24:7. The reform of the state justly, therefore, began with the destruction of this profane and sacrilegious place.—*Lord*, according to the former regulations, which had been lately ill observed, to prevent any thing unclean from coming in. 2 Par. 23:19. C.—Sept. “the priest placed overseers (επισκοπονς) in the house of the Lord. H.  
**19** *Phelethi* *.* In the Heb. of the books of Kings we read nothing of these bands after the reign of David. The same expressions occur here as v. 4. “the centurions, the rams, (or captains) and the runners,” ( C.) or guards. Prot. H.—*Gate*, on the west. Athalia had probably entered by the south.—*Kings.* It was made of ivory, &c. 3 K. 10:18. C.

## Chapter 12

**2** *Taught him.* Joiada lived, at least, till the 23d year of the reign of Joas, (v. 6.) and the king seems to have persevered some time longer in virtue.  
**3** *Places*, to the true God, but contrary to his law. The king was deterred from overturning these altars, through human policy; which did not meet with the divine approbation. C. See 3 K. 22:24. Deut. 12:8.  
**4** *Sanctified.* That is, dedicated to God’s service. Ch.—Lit. “of the holy” *sanctorum* *.* H.—For the use of the sanctuary.—*Pass*, as strangers, (3 K. 8:41) desiring sacrifice to be offered, (Grotius) or who pass in the roll of those who have attained their 20th year, and are obliged to pay half a sicle. Ex. 20:13, 14. This was the first fund which had been turned to a different purpose by the priests, ( C.) under the wicked kings. H.—*Soul.* that is, the ordinary oblation, which every soul was to offer by the law. Exod. 30. Ch.—Or, this was a second *fund* arising from the redemption of vows. Lev. 21:2.—*Lord.* Voluntary contributions, like that of the widow, (Luke 21:2) were also recommended; and Joas sent Levites throughout the land, every year, to collect what they could, for the reparation of the temple. 2 Par. 24:5.  
**5** *Order.* Heb. “acquaintance.” Let them receive the contributions on the spot where they reside; or, let those who are on duty in the temple take them. C.—*Thing.* Heb. “breach,” badek, a term which the Sept. retain. H.  
**6** *Temple.* It is not known when the king gave his orders; but they were executed with negligence, as they seemed to interfere ( C.) with the emoluments assigned by the law to the Levites. 2 Par. 24:5. H.—The latter Jews were obliged to pay half a sicle towards the repairs of the temple. T.  
**8** *Forbidden.* Heb. Sept. &c. “And the priests consented to take no,” &c. They were also obliged to restore what they had already received. C.  
**9** *By the altar*, yet *without* the enclosure, that any person might freely put in what he thought proper. 2 Par. 24:8. Priests were still appointed to watch, that no fraud was committed: and they counted the money which the law ordained to be paid. Josephus (Bel. vi. 5.) speaks of many coffers; one might be near the *altar*, and another *out* of the *door.* M.  
**10** *Priest*, or his deputy. Paral. C.—*Out.* Prot. “put it up in bags,” ( H.) or tied and afterwards weighed it.  
**11** *And they.* The king and the high priest conjointly. Paral.  
**13** *Bowls.* Chal. “silver chalices.” The precise import of the Heb. term is not well known. M.—*Lord.* After the repairs were finished, the remaining money, which was very considerable, was however employed for these purposes, 2 Par. 24:14. C. M.  
**15** *Faithfully*, and corresponded with the trust reposed in them. H.  
**16** *Sins.* These terms seem to be synonymous, though they may be distinguished. Lev. 4:2 and 5:15. If any one forgot to pay tithes, he was bound to make full reparation to the priests; (Tostat.) and the money which was given to them by strangers, to offer sacrifice, was not taken from them. C.  
**17** *Then.* After the death of Joiada, the king gave way to the greatest excesses of idolatry, and even murdered the son of his greatest benefactor. Hereupon the justice of God fell heavy upon him; *Geth* was taken, Jerusalem only saved by giving up all the sacred treasures, &c.: yea, the very next year, Hazael returned, routed the forces of Juda, and wounded the king, who on his return to the palace was murdered by conspirators, ( C.) to revenge the death of Zacharias. 2 Par. 24:25. Joseph. ix. 8.  
**18** *Joram*, &c. These are accused of plundering the temple, 2 Par. 24:7. But they might make some presents, through ostentation. How many rob the poor, while they erect magnificent altars to the God of the poor! C.  
**20** *Sella.* A flight of steps leading to the temple. H.—The palace was at the bottom of it, and had been built by Solomon. Here Joas was slain in his *bed.* Paral.  
**21** *Josachar*, or *Zabad, the son of Semmaath, an Ammonitess, and Jozabad,* *the son of Semarith, a Moabitess.* Par. Both their mothers were of foreign extraction. C.—People have frequently two names.—*Somer* is the father of Jozabad. M.—*David.* Achaz was treated in like manner. The fear of this infamy might tend to keep the kings in awe. After death, the kings of Egypt might be accused, and deprived of sepulture, if their crimes deserved it: as many of them were. Diod. i. p. 46. C.—Thus Joas was covered with eternal infamy, after he had begun so well. *Finis coronat opus* *.* H.

## Chapter 13

**1** *Years.* Two with his son Joas, (Usher) or three. Capell. D. See v. 10.  
**3** *Days*, while Joachaz lived, v. 22. M.—Yet Benadad only molested his son. C.—Hazael proved a dreadful scourge in the hand of God, to punish his people, C. 8:12. H.  
**5** *Saviour*, in the person of Joas, (v. 23. Tostat.) after the death of Joachaz, whose repentance preserved him, at least, in this world. H.  
**6** *A grove*, dedicated to the worship of idols. Ch.—Heb. “and the Ascera (grove of Astarte) was standing even in Samaria.” That impure worship had gained ground again, after Jehu was dead.  
**7** **Ver** **.** **7** **.** *Floor.* Amos (1:3) informs us, that Hazael had crushed the inhabitants of Galaad to death with iron chariots.  
**8** *Valour*, or personal courage, ( C.) though he gained no complete victory. The most valiant are not always successful. T.—*Fortiter ille facit qui miser esse potest* *.* Mart. H.—Joachaz did not quite sink under his troubles. T.  
**10** *Seven.* To complete the number seventeen, (v. 1.) it ought to be “nine” ending. Houbigant, p. 109. See C. 14:23.—*Years.* If Jeroboam reigned in the 15th year of Amasias, and his father in the 37th of Joas, and not in the 39th almost complete, this king would have held dominion eighteen years. Ibid.  
**12** *Juda*, who was the aggressor. See 2 Par. 25:23.  
**13** *Throne*, for ten years, along with his father. From this period the reign of Azarias must be dated. C. 15:1. Usher. C.  
**14** *The illness.* Heb. Sept. and Chal. “of his sickness whereof he also died;” insinuating that he had been before afflicted with this infirmity.—*To him*, probably in the same city of Samaria.—*Wept. See how he loved him!* He was concerned for the welfare of his kingdom. M.—*Thereof.* Eliseus had addressed Elias in the same terms. C. 2:12. C.  
**17** *East*, looking towards Galgaad, ( H.) which the Syrians occupied. M.—These actions were all significative and prophetical. The throwing of a dart was formerly the mode of declaring war. Virg. Æneid ix. Justin (ii.) says, “Alexander first threw a javelin, as against a hostile country.” Thus also the ancients took possession. Varro. V. Max. iii. &c. The people of Andros and Chalicis, sent each a deputy to seize Acanthos, when it had been abandoned by its inhabitants. The man from Andros, perceiving the other before him, threw his dart at the gate, and it was decided that he had thus lawfully obtained possession. Plutarch, q. Græc. Selden, Mare. Claus. iv.—The action of Joas may be considered in both lights.—*Them.* We do not read the particulars of this battle: but it must have been very bloody. One of the three victories (v. 25.) of Joas was probably obtained at *Aphec*, ( C.) a place memorable for the victory of Achab, over the same Syrians. 3 K. 20:26. M.  
**18** *Still.* This shewed a degree of remission. H.—It was natural for the king to conclude, that the more he struck the earth, the greater would be his success; ( C.) and the prophet had, perhaps, insinuated as much. M.  
**19** *Angry.* Sept. “grieved.” H.—*Or seven* is omitted in Heb. and Sept. This text proves that God knows what would take place conditionally. T.—*If*, &c. By this it appears, that God had revealed to the prophet that the king should overcome the Syrians, as many times as he should then strike on the ground; but, as he had not, at the same time, revealed to him how often the king would strike, the prophet was concerned to see that he struck but thrice. Ch.—Joas was assured that he should *consume* the Syrians. But this was to be understood, provided he performed this part, ( M. T.) and that destruction was not said to be entire. H.  
**20** *Buried him*, near Samaria. M.—He had been chosen by Elias sixty-eight years before, and had lived eleven with him. His perfect character is given, Eccli. 48:13. His double spirit represents the plentitude of grace in Jesus Christ; as his raising the child to life, in such a wonderful manner, denotes his incarnation. The waters of Jericho made sweet, and the healing of Naaman, set before us the virtue of baptism: as the widow’s oil shews the great graces which are bestowed by Christ upon his Church. The children devoured, and the Syrians struck blind, remind us of the perversity and blindness of infidels, who will not acknowledge the truth. Matt. 13:14. We must now see how the bones of Eliseus *prophesied:* 1. By raising the dead to life, as a confirmation of all his former predictions; 2. as proof of a future resurrection, of the virtue of relics, and of the influence of the saints in heaven, whose souls were formerly united to their bodies, and were filled with the Holy Spirit; (S. Cyr. of Jer. cat. xviii. Illum.) 3. in as much as this miracle was a figure of Christ’s resurrection, who raised himself to life, and those who believe in him: ( C.) while Eliseus, in the like state of death, had only raised another. H. S. Max. hom. i. de pasc.—*Same.* Sept. Heb. and Syr. “at the coming in of the year;” ( H.) or, “the next year.” Pagnin.  
**21** *Eliseus* *.* His tomb was not in the city, but in a spacious cave, the entrance of which was secured with a stone, according to custom. This was removed in the hurry, and the corpse thrown into the same recess, which had been prepared for the remains of the prophet. Josephus (ix. 8.) relates the history in a different manner, and pretends that robbers having slain a person, threw his corpse accidentally into the tomb of Eliseus. The Rabbins tell us his name was Sellum, and that he died again immediately, because he was a wicked man, which would render the miracle, in a manner, useless. C.—By it God honoured his servant, and convinced the Israelites that what he had so lately foretold, respecting the Syrians, would undoubtedly take place. M.  
**23** *Time.* Long before the captivity of Babylon, the Israelites had been led captives, to return no more in a body. Some stragglers mixed with the Jews, and inhabited the country under that appellation. It would seem that this was written before the overturning of the kingdom of Israel. H.  
**25** *Israel*, on the east side of the Jordan; (C. 10:33. C.) at least ( H.) those which had been taken from his *father.* Jeroboam retook what had been lost by Jehu. M.—Hence both these kings are styled saviours, v. 5. C. 14:27. Salien.

**1** *Second*, from his being associated in the empire. It was the first of his reigning alone.  
**3** *David. Yet not with a perfect heart.* 2 Par. 25:2.—*Father.* He imitated his early piety, as well as his miserable end. C.  
**4** *But*, &c. All that Amasias did, at first, *was right*, (v. 3.) *but this only.* See 3 K. 22:24. H.—Joas had also left such high places. C. 12:3.  
**6** *Sin.* This is the rule of human tribunals, to which God is not restrained. Salien. Ezec. 18:20. M.—The action of Amasias is commended as something unusual ( C.) among princes, who are but too apt to exceed the bounds of moderation ( H.) to revenge their murdered parents. C.  
**7** Edom, who had rebelled under Joram. C. 8:20. The particulars of this war are given, 2 Par. 25:5. Josephus (ix. 9.) says, Amasias designed also to attack Amalec and Gebal in the same country.—*Pits.* Called the *woody vale*, Gen. 14:8. ( M.) south-west of the Dead Sea, (Adric.) or rather to the south of Palmyra, towards Bosra, 3 K. 9:18.—*Rock.* Petra, the capital of the country, formerly called Rekem Arke, or Hagor. Most of the houses are hewn out of the rock. Heb. Sela signifies “a rock;” and many think that this was some other place, whence the Idumeans were hurled down, after the victory. Amasias gave it the name of Jectehel, “obedience of God,” in memory of his having obtained this success, in consequence of his having obeyed the prophet, and sent away 100,000, for whom he had paid 100 talents to the king of Israel.  
**8** *Let us see one another.* This was a challenge to fight. Ch. W.—The interviews of ambitious kings are often baneful. H.—Abner said in the same sense, “Let the young men rise and play,” 2 K. 2:14; and Virg. Æneid xii. *Inter se coiisse viros & cernere ferro* *.* Amasias had many reasons to be displeased with the king of Israel. He might justly redemand part of the money, ( C.) as he had not employed the soldiers. H.—They had also committed depredations in Juda. Paral. Jehu had slain Ochozias, and many of his relations. C.—Josephus also observes that he now required Israel to return to his obedience, and acknowledge the power of the lawful descendants of David. Sanctius.  
**9** *Thistle.* Heb. choach, something prickly; ( H.) “a thorn.” Syr. and Arab. “a plum-tree.” Nothing could be more cutting ( C.) than this answer of Joas, to shew the king of Juda how much he despised his power. H.—The ancients were much pleased with such ingenious similes. See Judg. 9:7.  
**10** *Home*, to boast of thy victory, ( H.) but do not offer to molest others. C.—God permitted that Amasias should pay no attention to this advice, nor to the prophet who reproached him for adoring the idols which he had brought from Edom, 2 Par. 25:14.  
**11** *Saw*, or fought, v. 8. C. 23:29. Bethsames was in the tribe of Dan, ( C.) but belonging to the king of *Juda.*  
**13** *Cubits.* Josephus says 300, and that he led Amasias in triumph through the ruins, (Ant. ix. 10.) on the west side, ( C.) or on the north. Villalp. M.  
**14** *Hostages*, as he left Amasias, on condition he should pay tribute, ( M.) and took “the children of the nobles” (Chal.) to secure his fidelity. H.  
**15** *Valour.* Hence it appears that Juda made a stout resistance, though Josephus would insinuate the contrary.  
**19** *Lachis*, in the tribe of Dan. Some say that the kings resided there twelve years, in a kind of exile. Malvenda.—But the conspiracy only took place in the last year of his reign. Usher, A. 3194.—Some powerful men rose up against him, and the people were displeased with his conduct. M.—But the majority did not approve of his death, so that they granted him the funeral honours, and appointed his son to succeed. C.  
**21** *Azarias.* Heb. Hazarya. Sometimes printed more correctly *Azieu*, at others *Azrien*, ( H.) by the blundering of transcribers, who have confounded the name of the king Ozihu (Azieu or Ozias) with that of the priest Ozrichu. (Azrien.) Carpzovius maintains that Azarias and Usias are two names of the same person. Crit. p. 789. But if he should find Carpzovius, Carpzorvius, and Carpzoviu, in the same book, would he not think them the same name erroneously printed? Kennicott, (Dis. i. p. 478.) who observes that the Syr. and Arab. versions have here, as in the sequel, Uzia, and S. Mat. (1:8) calls the king Ozias, conformably to 2 Par. 26:1. &c. The MSS. also vary. Kennicott.  
**22** *Built*, or rebuilt *Elath;* which gives its name to the eastern branch of the Red Sea. David had possession of all Idumea. Amasias had reconquered a great part, and his son pushed his conquests still further.  
**25** *Wildernes* *s*, or the Dead Sea, to which place the dominion of Israel originally extended, under Jeroboam I. C.—*Opher*, in the tribe of Zabulon. Ch.—Prot. “which *was* of Gath-hepher.” H.—We have not all the works of the prophets, nor did they write all their predictions. C.—Here we learn at what time Jonas lived. M.  
**26** *In prison* is not expressed in the original, ( C.) which has, “not any shut up, nor last.” Neither those who had strong castles, nor the poorest people, were exempt from suffering. H.—None durst appear. 3 K. 14:10. M.  
**27** *Israel*, like Amalec. 1 K. 15:3. M.  
**28** *To Juda*, or “of Juda;” *Judæ* *;* ( H.) as those strong cities had been conquered by David. The Syr. and Arab. omit this word entirely, and suppose, with many others, that Jeroboam kept possession of these cities. C. T.—*In I* *srael*, or “to Israel,” over which he reigned. H.  
**29** *Slept*, dying a natural death; though the idolatrous priests of Bethel falsely asserted, that Amos had foretold he should fall by the sword. Amos 7:11.

## Chapter 15

**1** *Twentieth.* Houbigant endeavours to shew it should be, “the 14th;” Capellus says, the 17th; ( H.) and others have suspected that the number is incorrectly printed. Grot. &c.—But this expedient ought only to be adopted when no other can give satisfaction; and this difficulty may be obviated by saying, that Jeroboam’s reign with his father continued six years, and that after he had held the septre nineteen years alone, Azarias commenced; ( C. Usher) or, that there was an interregnum of eleven years, which is not probable. Capel.—*Azarias;* otherwise called Ozias; ( Ch.) and this was his real name. Grot. See C. 14:21. H.  
**3** *Lord.* Many laudable actions are specified, 2 Par. 26:4. But at last, forgetting the instructions of the prophet Zacharias, he opened his heart to pride, the bane of great souls, and would arrogate to himself the rights of the priesthood, which brought on his leprosy. C.  
**4** *But.* In this he was not different from his father. C. 14:4.  
**5** *A lepe* *r.* In punishment of his usurping the priestly functions. 2 Par. 26:19. Ch. W.—The priests boldly remonstrated with him, but to no effect; till the king perceived himself stricken with the leprosy. Josephus (ix. 10.) says, a dreadful earthquake was felt at the same time, which is supposed to be that mentioned Amos 1:1 and Zac. 14:5; (S. Jerom, &c.) though Usher produces some chronological difficulties against this opinion: but they are founded on error. C.—*Free.* Par. *apart;* at a distance from all. H.—The like rules were observed in cities, as in the camp. Lev. 13:46. M.—Ozias was in a manner *de* *ad* to all civil transactions; and Isaias (6:1) probably refers to this event. Syr. and Arab. “he remained hidden.” Josephus (ibid.) says, “leading a private life.” Thus aiming at too much, he lost all! H.  
**7** *David:* or, *Oziaas slept … and they buried him in the field of the royal sepulchre, because he was a leper, and Joatham*, &c. 2 Par. 26:23. H.—Such an aversion had people for lepers, that they would not even bury them with others. C.—Yet he was treated with some honour. W.  
**8** *Thirtieth.* Usher would place an interregnum of eleven years and a half, after the death of Jeroboam, to make the first year of Zacharias correspond with the 38th of Azarias, during which, he supposes, the troubles mentioned Amos 7 and 8 happened. But this interregnum has no foundation, v. 5. C.—Capellus says it would have lasted above 22 years. He and Houbigant would read, 28th: the latter adds ten years to the reign of Zacharias. The transcriber might easily omit the years, as they end in the same manner as months. Arab. has “six years;” whence we may infer, that the copies formerly varied. The exploits of Zacharias require a longer space than *six months.* Chron. sac. p. 107. 110.  
**10** *Place*, having before taken his measures with the conspirators; (v. 15.) so that he had not to fear the resentment of the people. He cut off the last king of the family of Jehu; ( H.) probably at Jezrahel. Osee 1:5. C.  
**14** *Manahem*, general of Zacharias, revenged his death, and then returning to Tharsa, treated it and the neighbouring city, *Thapsa*, with the utmost fury. So Josephus, ix. 11. But his conjectures are to be received with caution.  
**17** *Ten years.* Dating from the time that he was enabled to enjoy the throne in peace, after a struggle of eleven months. Usher, A. 3233.—Phul rendered him this service, having received presents, and one of the golden calves, (Osee 10:6 and 13) besides 1000 talents, v. 19.  
**18** *Days.* During which Jeroboam or Manahem swayed the sceptre. C.—The Sept. refer *all his days* to the following verse, ( H.) which seems to intimate that the tribute was required annually, as may be gathered from the Vulg. *veniebat* *.* M.—But Phul probably received the talents only once, to indemnify him for his trouble. He was perhaps the father of Sardanapalus, who joined his name, Phul, to his own, Sardan; as Merodach assumed that of Baladan. Isai. 39:1. Profane authors style the father of Sardanapalus, Anacindaraxes, &c. Phul was the first of the Assyrian monarchs who came into the land of Israel, where we shall find them too often in the sequel. He probably repented on the preaching of Jonas, and averted the scourge ( C.) which fell upon the city during the reign of his son. H.  
**20** *Rich.* The lower classes were not perhaps entirely exempted.  
**25** *Near.* Heb. “may be along with Argob, &c.” who were in the conspiracy. Chal. Sept. &c. C.  
**26** *Israel.* This book is lost. H.—The Paral. takes no notice of these kings; but relates only the transactions of the kings of Juda after Joas gained the victory; which greatly abridged their power. C. 14:14.  
**27** *Romelia.* S. Jerom (ep. 142.) places the birth of Romulus in this year, which preceded the famous Olympiads. But Salien differs that event 14 years. A.C. 769. H.  
**29** *Assyria*, at the invitation of Achaz. C. 16:7.—*Theglathphalasar* is probably the same who is called Ninus the younger, or Thilgam, (Ælian. animal. xii. 21.) by profane writers. He re-established the kingdom of Nineve in part, after the city had been taken, under his father Sardanapalus, by Arbaces, founder of the empire of the Medes, and by Belesus, narbonassar, or Baladan, who reigned at Babylon. Such was the state of the eastern empires at this time. C.—*Aion*, or Ahion, (3 K. 15:20) perhaps the Enan of Ezechiel 48:1. H.—*Mo* *acha*, whither Seba had retreatd, 2 K. 20:14. Heb. Abel-beth-maacha.—*Galaad*, comprising all the east of the Jordan. C.—*Nephthali*, to the north-west. H.—Thus the Galileans and Nephthali were transported into Assyria, to repeople it after the late ravages. The tribe in Galaad were fixed on the river Gozan, 1 Par. 5:26.  
**30** *In the twentieth year of Joatham.* That is, in the twentieth year from the beginning of Joatham’s reign. The sacred writer chooses rather to follow here this date, tan to speak of the years of Achaz, who had not yet been mentioned. Ch.—But Joatham reigned only 16 years, (v. 33) so that this was the fourth year of Achaz. H.—Usher says that Osee did not ascend the throne till nine years after the death of Phacee, as he is asserted to have commenced his reign in the twelfth year of Achaz. C. 17:1. But another difficulty arises from the mention of this 20th year, as Phacee would have reigned 22, instead of 20; (v. 27.) for Joatham only commenced in the second year of Phacee. To reconcile these passages, we may conclude that Osee conspired against the king of Israel in the 18th year of Joatham, gained possession of part of the kingdom in the 20th of the same prince, and of the whole in the 12th of Achaz. C.—The pretended interregnum ought to be rejected, as the murderer of the late king would not delay to ascend the throne. Houbigant adds 10 years to the reign of Phacee, as well as to that of Zacharias: the dates assigned to the kings of Israel being otherwise so much deficient, p. 113.  
**34** *Did he.* Yet he did not imitate his presumption. God gave great success to his enterprises, 2 Paral. 27:2.  
**35** *Gate*, repairing that on the east. Jeremias (26:10) mentions the *new gate.* Joatham also made great additions to the walls of Jerusalem. Paral.  
**37** *Began.* Achaz was much more infested by these princes.

## Chapter 16

**2** *When he*, Joatham, “had begun,” *cœpisset* *.* H.—Thus Junius evades the following difficulty. D.—*Sixteen*, consequently he died when he was 36 years old. As Ezechias was 25 when he came to the throne, Achab must have been a father at 11 ( C.) or 12 year of age. Bochart, Dissert. xxiii.—S. Jerom asserts the same of Solomon, and observes, that “many things which seem incredible in Scripture, are nevertheless true.” ep. ad Vital. He, with some others, has recourse to a miracle. Others suppose that Ezechias was an adopted son, or kinsman, or that the numbers are incorrect, &c. But we are assured by respectable authors, ( H.) that people have children very soon in the hotter climates. Busbeque (Ep. 3.) says, in Colchis many are mothers at ten years of age; and to convince the incredulous, produce their infants “not much bigger than a large frog.” Albert the Great says he knew one who had a child at 10, and Navarre (ap. Sanchez. Mat. 7:2, 5 disp. 104.) was credibly informed that a similar fact was seen at Naples. Mandesle observes that this is common in India. He says one had lately a child at six year of age, which was there thought remarkable. S. Jerom mentions a boy who became a father at 10, and Sanchez relates that the same happened in Spain. A boy under 12 had a child by a girl of 10, in Provence. Scaliger Elenc. The Romans laws fix upon the age of 14 for males, and 12 for females’ lawfully marrying; ( H.) though many examples of people having children before that age are produced by Tiraqueau, 6. conn. 36. Yet physicians require 13 in males, and 14 years complete in females before they are capable of this effect. Genebrard. S. Aug. (de Civ. xv. 11. and xvi. c. ult. and in ps. civ.) maintains that a person of 10 years of age is unfit for generation. C.—*Malitia* *supplet ætatem* *.* Achaz was a monster of wickedness. H.—In the first year of his reign, and in the fifth Olympiad, the Ephori were appointed at Sparta under Theopompus, nephew of Lycurgus. Salien, A.C. 759.  
**3** *Fire*, to purify him (or them, Paral. *filios*, all were treated thus. H.) according to the superstitions of the pagans: *omnia purgat edax ignis* *.* Ovid, Fast. Theod. q. 16. M.—Others believe that the child was burnt to death in honour of Moloch, and in imitation of the Chanaanites. Ps. 105:37. Deut. 18:10. The Carthaginians were required by Gelon, king of Syracuse, to lay aside this most barbarous custom. Phil. apoph. Yet, “infants were publicly immolated to Saturn, in Africa, till the proconsulate of Tiberius, who ordered the priests to be exposed on those same trees which shaded their crimes, as on votive crosses. This the soldiers, my countrymen, who executed the proconsul’s orders, can testify; and still the sacred crime is perpetrated in secret.” Tert. Apol. viii.—How tenacious are people of old errors! H.  
**5** *Then.* In punishment of such enormous crimes, God first delivered Achaz into the hands of Rasin, (2 Par. 28. S. Jer. in Isai. vii.) and afterwards Phacee destroyed 120,000 in one battle, and took 200,000 prisoners, whom the prophet Oded persuaded him to release. Ibid. v. 8. 11. Salien (A.C. 759.) observes that the two kings then joined their forces, and besieged Jerusalem the following year, but to no purpose. H.—Isaias was sent before the siege to encourage Achaz, and to promise the miraculous birth of the Messias, as a sign that he should be delivered: and to convince him of it the more, he foretold that the two kings should be destroyed before his own son should be able to say *father.* Isai. 7:8, &c. Yet as Achaz did not still amend his life, God sent the same kings the following year ( M. 3263.) to lay waste the country. C.  
**6** *Juda.* Lit. “Jews,” Judæos, ( H.) which is the first time we find this appellation. D.—*Aila*, or Elath, which had been taken by Ozias. C. 14:22. M.—It seems never to have belonged to *Syria*, as it was too far from Damascus. Instead of *Aram*, we should therefore probably read Edom, which words in Heb. are extremely similar, and have been often mistaken, (Judg. 11:17. C.) particularly as we find that the *Edomites* took possession of the city. This latter word is indeed *Syrians* in Heb. &c. H.—Josephus and others maintain that the Syrians seized and kept the place. But they were most likely only invited by the Idumeans to come to their assistance. C.  
**7** *Son*, vassal, or under thy protection. C.—*Save me.* Achaz sinned by this placing his confidence in man, after the prophet had given him such assurance from the Lord. M.—He has soon reason to repent of having brought this proud ally into his dominions, as he proved a great scourge; (2 Par. 28:20) no less than the Saxons did to the ancient Britons.  
**9** *Cyrene*, not in Egypt, where he had no power, but near the river Cyrus, ( C.) in higher Media. Josephus.—Heb. “and took it and carried *the inhabitants* captives to Kir,” ( H.) whence the Syrians had come originally. Amos 9:7. Arbaces, who had dismembered Media from the Assyrians empire, was now dead, and the king of Nineve had retaken several cities, occupying Rages, &c. (Tob. 1:16. &c.) before Dejoces mounted the throne, and extended the empire of the Medes. Usher.—The people of Sepharvaim lived also on the borders of Media. C. 18:11.  
**10** *To meet*, and congratulate the king on his victory, and perhaps to divert him from proceeding any father. C.—But it was too late, v. 7. H.—The same year Phacee hastened to defend his dominions, but was slain by Osee. Salien, A.C. 757.  
**11** *Priest*, or pontiff, as no other would have dared to make this innovation. Salien.—He was guilty of a great weakness; as the altar of Solomon had been so solemnly consecrated by God’s presence. All changes in religion are dangerous. The Machabees behaved with far greater respect, with regard to the altar which had been profaned. 1 Mac. 4:45. C.—Isaias (8:2) calls this priest a *faithful*, or competent *witness*, ( H.) on account of his dignity, not approving his conduct. Salien.—But he had not erected this altar when the prophet spoke thus to him. D.  
**12** *And worshipped.* Heb. simply, “and the king approached to the altar, and offered on it (13) his holocaust and his meat (or flour) offering, and poured hid drink-offering, and the blood of his peace-offerings, upon the altar.” H.—He dedicated it with all sorts of sacrifices, forbidding any other to be used in the temple. But shortly after he shut up the temple entirely. 2 Par. 28:24 and 29:3. He offered sacrifice to idols upon this altar, (Abul.) while the priests made use of the same altar to sacrifice to the true God, (v. 15. M.) unlawfully.  
**14** *And from.* Heb. “from between the *new* altar and the house of,” &c. H.—Achaz had placed his altar before that of Solomon: but he afterwards removed the latter from the right-hand of the sanctuary, to a corner of the court, on the *north* side. C.—In the midst of his distress, he despised God; sacrificed to the gods of the Syrians, as more powerful and victorious than the Lord; pillaged the temple, which he shut up during the remainder of his reign, ( H.) and erected altars for himself in all the corners of Jerusalem. 2 Par. 28:24.  
**15** *Morning*, as prescribed in the law. Ex. 29:38.—*King’s* ordained for sin: (Lev. 4:22) or instituted by Solomon, who left a fund. H. 2 Par. 8:12. M.—The law says nothing about the king’s daily holocaust and *sacrifice* of flour. H.—But it probably was offered after the morning and evening sacrifices. This Achaz calls *his own*, (v. 12. C.) as he had not yet laid aside the practice.—*Pleasure.* Heb. “to inquire about.” H.—I shall do what I think proper with it. M.  
**17** *Stone*, all out of avarice, ( H.) and contempt of the Lord, who chastized him. M.—He took away the plates of brass, &c. from the doors, ( C.) which Ezechias was forced to replace, ( H.) afterwards to take down for the Assyrians. C. 18:16. C.  
**18** *Musach* *.* The covert, or pavilion, or tribune for the king. Ch.—Achaz would not have his ally to be in the court, but placed his throne in the temple. D.—Sept. “and the foundation of the chair he built in the house of the Lord.” H.—Heb. “and the (musac) covert, *or* tribune of the sabbath, which they had built in the temple, and the king’s entry without, the turned ( H.) round ( M.) from the temple, for the king of Assur.” He despoiled these rich ornaments, to gratify the Assyrian. H.—Solomon had built a most magnificent tribune. 2 Par. 6:13. See C. 11:6. The *musach of Juda*, was the pulpit; from which the law was read. Isai. 22:8. The king’s tribune was near the eastern gate, which was only opened on the sabbath. Ezec. 46:1. Some believe that the *musach* was a large curtain, suspended over the court, to keep off the sun’s beams. Eupolemus speaks of some very magnificent ones, (Euseb. præp. ix. 34. as does also Josephus; such as those which covered the Roman theatres. Others think it was a tent for the priests to take a little rest, or for the door-keepers, or a chest designed to receive the contributions for the repairs of the temple, or for the king to distribute his alms, or a covered throne for him to sit down on. C.  
**19** *Book.* Heb. “in the chronicles;” or, “in the book of the annals.” H.  
**20** *With them;* but not in the same sepulchre, on account of his impiety. 2 Par. 28:27. C.—In the 5th year of his reign, the Idumeans harassed the country, and in the 6th, the Philistines took several towns; (Salien) so that he fell a prey to enemies on all sides, and was memorable for nothing but impiety and disasters. H.—Rome was built, and Numa born, on the 21st of April, in the 9th year of Achaz, and the first of the 7th Olympiad. Salien, A.C. Christ 751.

## Chapter 17

**1** *Twelfth.* Houbigant would substitute 14th, to make the dates agree, p. 113. See C. 15:30. H.—Till this time, Osee had been tributary to the Assyrian monarch. Grotius.—Heb. may be, “in the 12th year … Osee … had reigned … nine years; which his true. C.—He reigned so long afterwards, v. 6. H.  
**2** *Him.* The Jews say, that he did not hinder his subjects from going to Jerusalem to adore. One of the golden calves had been sent away by Manahem. Osee 10:5. C.—Yet under the less wicked king the nation is destroyed, as their crimes were come to the height; and Osee had not sufficient virtue to suspend the stroke of divine justice any longer. H.  
**3** *Salmanasar*, who is called Salman, or Salomo; (Osee 10:14) and Enemassar, in the Greek of Toby. The Tyrians relate that he took many of their towns, but that Tyre sustained a siege of five years. Joseph. ix. 14.  
**4** *Sua* *;* probably Sabachon, king of Ethiopia, who made himself master of Egypt, and burnt king Bocchoris alive. Herodotus (ii. 137.) calls him Abacus. Jocquelot thinks that Sethon is meant, and that he was invaded by Sennacherib on account of this league with Osee. C.—*Prison*, after he had taken the city, ( H.) which held out three years. This great city was then reduced to a heap of ruins, and so continued till after the captivity of the Jews, (1 Esd. 4:17) when it began to be peopled again. The inhabitants revolted against Alexander the Great, who placed Macedonians in their city, and gave the territory to the Jews. It was afterwards seized by the kings of Egypt and of Syria. But Hyrcan retook it, and levelled it with the ground. Gabinius built another town here, which bore his name till Herod greatly enlarged it, and called it Sebaste. C.—The prophets describe the distress of Samaria. Osee 10:4 and 14:1. Mic. 1:6. Jer. 31:5.  
**6** *Medes.* See C. 16:9. The great maxim and policy of these nations, was to transport the conquered nations to a distant country, in order to prevent any revolts. C.  
**9** **Ver** **.** **9** **.** *Offended.* Heb. “They concealed (or spoke secretly, H.) words, which were not right before the Lord:” ( C.) being guilty of hypocrisy or of blasphemy. H.—*Watchmen:* the meanest huts. T.—All was contaminated. C.—Towers were erected to guard the flocks from thieves. 2 Par. 26:10. M.  
**10** *Groves.* Heb. Asherim, Astarte or Venus, to whom “the groves” were consecrated. C. 21:7. and 23:4. C.  
**11** **1** **.** *Removed* by the sword, ( M.) or by flight. H.  
**12** *Abominations.* Heb. gillulim, “idols of dung.”—*Thing.* Lit. “word.”  
**13** *Seers.* See 1 K. 9:9. M.—God never ceased to admonish the rebels. H.—Jer. 25:5. M.  
**15** *Testimonies.* The ceremonial law was in memory of some great transactions, as the sabbath was of the creation; and the whole law was given with great solemnity, in the presence of witnesses. C.  
**16** *Heaven:* sun and mood; and the stars, which were like the soldiers of the two former. This expression is very common in Scripture.  
**17** *Fire.* See C. 16:3.—*Delivered.* Heb. “sold,” 3 K. 21:20. 1 Mac. 1:16. C.—*To provoke.* This was the consequence of their wickedness. W.  
**18** *Sight*, as objects of horror, cast away from the temple, and from the promised land.—*Tribe*, or kingdom. See 3 K. 12:20. Israel began to be rejected by God, when the schism took place. H.—It was entirely lost, when Salmanasar took the people into captivity. Some few were left; and these formed a part of the kingdom of Josias, on their returning to the service of the true God, (2 Par. 24:6) while others fled into Egypt. Osee 8:13 and 9:3. C.  
**23** *Day.* If Esdras was the author of this book, as it is very probable, this observation would tend to show how much more favourably the Jews were treated than the kingdom of Israel, which was still, for the most part, in captivity. C.  
**24** *Kin* *g*, Assaraddon, who led away the remnants of Israel, and fulfilled the prediction, Isai. 7:8. D.—*Babylon*, or the territory. These people had been lately conquered from the Babylonian empire, from Syria, &c.—*Cutha:* the greatest part were from this city; so that the Samaritans were afterwards called Cutheans.—Emath, on the Orontes.—*Sepharvaim;* or the Saspires, near Media. C.—We find several other places mentioned, 1 Esd. 4:9. H.  
**25** *Lions.* The Sam. Chronicle says the fruits, though beautiful to the eye, were of a poisonous quality; and Josephus, as usual, (ix. 14.) alters the text, saying that the people were afflicted with pestilence, and the oracle being consulted, told them to worship the High God; on which account, they desired the king to send them a priest. C.—These nations had not been accustomed *to fear the Lord* in their own country; but God was more offended when they exercised their idolatrous worship in that land, which he had chosen in a particular manner for himself. M.—He suffers wickedness and infidelity to prevail to a certain point; but when his patience is exhausted, ( C.) all nature fights for him against the wicked. H.  
**26** *King;* Assar-adon. 1 Esd. 4:2. They did not send as soon as they came into the country.—*Land.* They reason according to their false notions, as if a plurality of gods were not incompatible: and all would go on well, if each were served according to his will. On the same principle, they united the worship of the true God with that of idols, ( C.) as had been done before by the Israelites. M.—Yet God having shewn that he could have forced them to comply, (Tostat.) was pleased to remove the scourge; as if he preferred that imperfect worship rather than to suffer pure idolatry to reign. Genebrard.  
**27** *Let him.* Heb. Chal. Sept. “them go.” Probably more went; but *one* was of superior dignity. He might have been priest of the golden calves, as none of the priests of Jerusalem had yet been taken. Hence he taught the Cutheans to join the worship of God with that of idols. Some think that no part of the Scripture was used among them, till the building of the temple by Sanballat, on Mount Garizim: (Le Quien, Antiquite. v. 13.) but this is extremely improbable. How should he pretend to teach the law without the books of Moses? H.—The Samaritans have retained the Pentateuch in the Phœnician character, while the Jews have insensibly adopted the Chaldee, during their captivity. On some occasions, these people have boasted of their descent from the patriarchs. Jo. 4:12 and 20. But in times of danger, they have confessed their true origin. Joseph. ix. fin. and xii. 5.  
**28** *Bethel.* Garizim was not then honoured with the temple, as the Samaritans would pretend. Chron. They wished to join in building that at Jerusalem, under Esdras. C.—*Lord.* Collins would make us believe, that the Samaritans continued “for a long time” without the Pentateuch, and all “heathens for many ages.” But the first supposition “is to me incredible,” says Kennicott; and Hottinger himself allows, that the priests did bring back a copy of the law “exactly corresponding with the autograph of Moses.” Exert. p. 8. And as for the Samaritans being heathens, Prideaux, whom this infidel writer quotes, ( H.) says, “consistently with his Bible, that they continued in that gross idolatry of worshipping other gods *in conjunction with the True;* which last words are very unfairly omitted.” Kennicott, Diss. ii. p. 115.—This was the true origin and state of this mixture of nations, who were sent to cultivate the lands of Samaria. H.  
**29** *Dwelt.* This impure service did not deserve a mitigation of the late chastisement. But God often punishes in this world ( H.) to manifest his glory, (Jo. 9:3) and spares to display his power ( C.) and goodness. H.—He had sufficiently convinced these nations of his dominion over all.  
**30** *Socoth-benoth*, “the tents of young women,” who prostituted themselves once in their lives at Babylon, in honour of Mylitta. Herod. ii. 199.—*Nergel*, “light.” C.—The Pyreia ( H.) of the Persians are famous in history. Strabo xv. Selden, Synt. ii. 8.—*Asima*, like an ape, goat, &c. C.  
**31** *Hevites*, who came from Ava.—*Nebahaz.* “Nebo the seeing, *or* living and possessing.” Nebo was a famous idol of Babylon.—*Tharthac* *;* perhaps Sar, (prince) Sak, or Sesac, (Jer. 25:26 and 51:41) the sun, &c.—*Adramelech*, “the magnificent king,” and *Anamelech*, “the king of clemency,” may denote the sun and moon; as these were the divinities commonly adored in the East, under various names. The same victims were offered to these as to Moloc and Saturn; whence we may infer, that they were the same idols. S. Jerom translates the work of Eusebius on the Heb. ( C.) and places without any disapprobation of his opinion, that Socoth-benoth, &c. were the names of towns, which the people built in Samaria. H.  
**32** *Worshipped*, or appeared to worship: for true religion admits of no false god. W.—*Lowest.* This expression sometimes means the most noble. H.—But the priests were chosen from the midst of the people, without examination. They employed the priest, whom the king had sent for the worship of the true God, whilst others were appointed to serve the idols. C.  
**34** *His ceremonies.* Heb. “they fear not the Lord, neither do they after their statutes.” Prot. H.—This involves a sort of contradiction, unless we explain it of the Israelites; thought hey had not been mentioned before. There is a confusion in the original text; and v. 41 seems to require that we should understand it in this manner, as the Cutheans could hardly be blamed for neglecting a thing of which they had before no knowledge. The Israelites are justly blamed for obstinately continuing in their prevarication, even in the midst of their captivity. The Syr. and Arab. translate, “The Israelites have been forced to leave their country, because they have abandoned the Lord; and they have not obeyed his laws, his precepts, and his ordinances, which he gave to,” &c. Many adopt this explanation. Jun. Vatab. &c. C.—Sept. make these people unite the true and the false worship, as v. 41. “They did according to their judgment. These fear, and do according to their justifications (δικαιωματα) and decision; and according to the law,” &c. H.

## Chapter 18

**1** *Third*, far advanced, as he was associated by his father in the last year of his reign, ( C.) or three years before its termination. D.  
**3** *Good;* opening the temple, celebrating the Passover with extraordinary magnificence, &c. He had invited people from all Israel, and at their return they broke many statues. Ezechias provided for the subsistence of the Levitical tribe, by ordering the laws to be put in execution in their favour. 2 Paral. 29 and 30.  
**4** *Groves.* The people were now more obedient, being terrified at the chastisement of Israel, ( C.) though Samaria was not taken till the sixth year of this good king; who carried his reform rather than most of his predecessors, ( H.) in destroying the high places which had been unlawfully ( C.) retained, as consecrated to the true God. See v. 22. H.—Yet Josias had still some to remove. M.—*Nohestan* *;* that is, *their brass*, or *a little brass.* So he called it in comtempt, because they had made a god of it. Ch.—Before, this image had been treated with due respect. When any relic or image becomes the occasion of abuse in the Catholic Church, it is thus taken away, or the error is otherwise corrected. See S. Aug. de C. x. 8. Ser. 14. de Verb. Ap. &c. W.—Some of the ancients assert, that Ezechias suppressed many books of Solomon, on account of similar abuses. But this seems not to be well attested. We know that he made a collection of some of some of his sentences. Prov. 25:1.  
**5** *Like him.* Ezechias was remarkable for many excellent qualities. Yet we must not push these comparisons too far, contrary to the intention of the sacred writers. The same eulogium is given to Josias, (C. 23:25) and David seems to be preferred. C. 19:34. These three are particularly commended. Eccli. 49:5. C.—Their virtues were certainly different in some respects. T.  
**7** *Wisely.* Heb. “with success.” Syr. &c. “he was victorious wherever he went.”—*Rebelled.* The Assyrian assumed an undue authority in consequence of the words of Achaz, (C. 16:7) and arrogated to himself the authority of doing what he pleased with the people, v. 32. Ezechias having formed various alliances, judged it necessary to make some resistance. Yet the prophet Isaias (30:1) complains of his applying to the Egyptians. C.  
**8** *City.* Thus he punished them for their late invasion. 2 Par. 28:18.  
**9** *Samaria.* The same history is given, C. 17:3. C.  
**11** *By the rivers.* Gozan was the name of the river, as above; ( H.) so that Salien suspects it should be *fluvii*, “of the river.” M.  
**13** Sennacherib’s expedition in Egypt and Asia are mentioned by Herodotus (ii. 141.) and Berosus, (Joseph. x. 1.) but they do not say that he passed farther then Pelusium, ( C.) the frontier on the Egyptian side of Palestine. H.—These expeditions might have been performed in less than eight months, during the 14th year of Ezechias, who fell sick, perhaps soon after the ruin of Sennacherib’s army. C. 20:1. Isaias (10:28) represents the Assyrian proceeding from Gabaa towards Egypt, and thence he *ascended* to attack the cities of Juda, (v. 25.) Manresa, (Mic. 1:15.) &c. While he was before Lachis, Ezechias, dreading the horrors of war, purchased a peace: but the tyrant soon after sent to require him to surrender at discretion; and in the mean time he went to besiege Lebna, where his envoys found him, having received no answer from the king of Juda. The haughty Assyrian being obliged to go to meet the king of Chus, sent insolent letters to Ezechias; but the latter was assured that all his menaces were to be despised, and on the same night that Sennacherib left Lebna, the angel destroyed 185,000 of his men. It is thought that the siege of Lachis did not take place till three years after Sennacherib had come into Palestine, and after he had spent that time in attacking Egypt, C. 19:24. Joseph. x. 2. and 3.—He attempted afterwards to take the southern cities of Juda, in order to cut off all communication with Egypt; as Nabuchodonosor, Holofernes, and Eupator probably intended to do. Jer. 24:7. Judith 6 and 7. 1 Mac. 6:31. C.—*Offended*, and been imprudent. M.—*Gold*, so that the value of each was equal. D.—Josephus reads, “or thirty,” as if that quantity of gold would suffice. H.—The *talent* contains 3000 sicles. M.—The heart of Ezechias fainted at the approach of so great an army, though he had before made the greatest preparations. C. 20:2. 2 Par. 32:5. Eccli. 48:19. T.  
**16** *On them.* All must go to meet the exigencies of the state. Grot. Jur. ii. 5.—The doors of temples and palaces were frequently adorned with the most precious metals, as Homer describes the palace of Alcinous; (Odys. H.) and Tavernier (vii. 12.) speaks of some mosques in Persia, the doors of which are covered with plates of silver. See Joseph. Bel. vi. 6.  
**17** **V** **er.** **17** **.** *Tharthan*, or *Thathania*, (1 Esd. 5:3) and in the Greek of Isa. 20:1 means “the president of tributes,” or presents. The two other names denote “the chief eunuch,” and “the chief butler,” and are not proper names. These officers were sent at the head of a *strong army* to Jerusalem.—*Field*, by the torrent Cedron, to the east. There they defied the king, or perhaps endeavoured to persuade him to come out, that they might seize his person. C. They came in a military capacity, rather than as ambassadors.  
**18** *House.* Josephus says, “procurator of the palace *or* kingdom.” H.—The house often refers to the temple, when placed without any explanation. Isai. 22:15. C.—Eliacim was prefect of the prætorium, (Salien) or grand master of the palace. He was richly dressed, and possessed a great authority over the people.—*Scribe.* See Judg. 8:14. This Sobna, according to S. Jerom, is different from the one who was over the house in the days of Manasses, before Eliacim was restored to his office, ( C.) unless he also was a different person. T.—The Jews say Sobna was deprived of his dignity, on account of his having betrayed the lower city to Sennacherib. See Isai. 22:21.—*Recorder*, or chancellor, &c. 2 K. 8:16. C.  
**20** *Counsel.* Heb. “Thou sayest (*but they are but* vain words) I have counsel and strength for the war.” Prot. H.—You have vainly boasted. C.—Isai. 26:5. C.  
**21** *Pierce it.* He alludes to the reeds which grow on the Nile. See Delrio, adag. 210. Egypt had been already greatly harassed in the expedition of Sennacherib, so that no succour could be expected thence. C.  
**22** *Jerusalem.* Many were perhaps displeased at this injunction, and Rabsaces endeavoured to excite them to revolt, and insinuates ( C.) that the king had made God his enemy, ( H.) and must expect punishment from him. Theod. in Isai. xxxvi. 5. He perhaps was ignorant that these altars were contrary to his law. M.—Yet the Jews say that Rabsaces was son of Isaias, (ap. S. Jer. bib.) or a Samaritan.  
**23** *Over.* Josephus insinuates that it is a challenge to fight, and that Rabsaces was so confident of victory, that he made this contemptuous proposal, ( H.) knowing that the subjects of Ezechias were not good horsemen, ( C.) or that they were comparatively ( H.) so few in number. M.—Heb. “agree, *or* give pledges to my master.”  
**25** *Destroy.* Prosperity renders a man insolent, and the passions blind him. Rabsaces interprets success to be a sure proof of the divine approbation, and thus attempts to justify all the excesses of his master. C.—God only used Sennacherib as a rod to chastise his people. M.—The most wicked often represent themselves as the executioners of God’s will, and attribute their ambition to his decrees. H.—God did not order the Assyrians to destroy the land: he rather threatened to destroy them. Isai. 37. 2 Par. 32. W.  
**26** *Syriac*, or Chaldee language, which was spoken at the Assyrian court, 1 Esd. 4:7. Dan. 2:4. Rabsaces was acquainted with both the languages; as the Jews say he was an apostate, which they infer from this passage, and from the legates tearing their clothes when they heard him blaspheme; as t hey pretend this was only done when blasphemy came from the mouth of an Israelite. Grotius.—But these reasons are very weak. C.—The like was practised when any thing terrifying was heard, v. 37. H.—The reasons why the legates desire Rabsaces not to speak in a language which the common soldiers understood, was to prevent them from shewing their indignation by shooting at him, or out of fear, lest they should be induced to cause some sedition. M.  
**27** *With you.* Insolent bravado! whence some have inferred the probability of pigeons’ dung being really eaten. (C. 6:25.) C.—Rabsaces threatens them with all the horrors of famine, so that they shall eat such things, if they refuse to give up the city. M.  
**29** *My.* Heb. and Vat. Sept. “his (Sennacherib’s) hand.” But the other reading of the Syriac, &c. is more natural. These words do not occur Isai. 36:14.  
**31** *Advantage.* Heb. “make a blessing,” or present. C.—Chal. and Syr. “peace.”  
**32** *Till.* Sennacherib will remove you to another country, but it will be as good as this. He requires you to surrender at discretion. C.—*Deliver us.* This will not be in his power, no more than it was in that of the other tutelary gods. M.—Infidels and heretics are very foolish thus to compare their delusions with God, and his holy religion. W.  
**34** Emath, Emesa.—*Arphad*, or Arad, an island and city on the continent, ( C.) near Tyre.—*Of Ana*, &c., “of,” is not expressed in the Vulg. ( H.) and it may be explained as if Ana and Ava were idols of Sepharvaim. M.—But they are commonly supposed to be cities. H.—Ana is probably a city ( D.) built on both sides of the Euphrates, four days’ journey from Bagdat. Isaias does not specify these cities in the parallel passage, but they are found in the letter addressed to Ezechias, Isai. 37:13.—*Samaria*, or the inhabitants who had come from distant parts, and had perhaps revolted. We do not however find the Sennacherib had conquered them, nor does the pretend that all these conquests were made by himself. C.—He gives part of the honour to his ancestors. C. 19:12. 2 Par. 32:13. But he asserts that all the gods of the respective countries of Samaria, &c. had yielded to his superior force. H.—Strange infatuation in a man who looked upon the idols as gods! They are in effect nothing. 1 Cor. 8:4. But as their votaries were of a different persuasion, ought they not to have acted and spoken consistently? Yet Suetonius (Caius, c. 5.) informs us, that “on the day when Germanicus died, the temples were stoned, the altars of the gods overturned, the domestic lares thrown out by some into the open air;” all to express their grief and indignation at the gods, for not preserving his life. H.  
**36** *The people.* The three legates, ( C.) Isai. 36:21. *And they held their peace.* H.  
**37** *Rent*, as was customary on such dismal occasions. Joakim is reprehended for not shewing this mark of consternation, when he heard the dreadful predictions of Jeremias, 36:24. C.

## Chapter 19

**3** *Blasphemy.* The enemy insults over us ( C.) and over God. H.—*Birth.* Heb. “the mouth of the womb.” Vatab.—This comparison shews the utmost distress to which the people of Jerusalem were reduced. Any great anguish is denoted by a *woman in travail.* Deut. 2:25. Ps. 47:7. Homer (Iliad *A*) thus describes the uneasiness of Agamemnon. C.—Ezechias found himself unable to contend with the Assyrian, though he wished to do it. M.—Without courage, all hope of escaping is lost. D.  
**4** *It may.* Lit. “if perhaps the Lord hear.” H.—*Found.* After such devastation has been made in the country, particularly by carrying away the ten tribes, ( C.) Ezechias recommends the kingdom to the prayers of the prophet; as we are exhorted to have recourse to the intercession of the saints. H.  
**7** *Upon* *him*, so that he shall be eager enough to return, ( C.) being filled with consternation at the approach of Tharaca, ( M.) and at the destruction of his men by an angel, v. 35. H.—Lachis and Lobna were both in the mountains of Juda, to the south of Jerusalem. Jos. 10:31. C.  
**9** *When he*, Sennacherib, though it would seem to refer to Rabsaces. H.—*Tharaca*, called by Thearchon by Strabo, (i. and xv. p. 653.) extended his conquests as far as the pillars of Hercules. Megasthenes.—The Egyptians seem to have called him Sethon, and assert that the god (Vulcan) appeared to him on the approach of Sennacherib, assuring him of his protection. He encamped near Pelusium, where the enemy’s army on its arrival was infested with rats, which destroyed their armour, and made them an easy prey. Herodot. ii. 141. It is probable that Taphnes, near Pelusium, was the capital city of Tharaca. Isai. 18 and 30:4. He does not appear to have joined battle with Sennacherib, whose army was destroyed on its march (ib. 10:24) the very night that the prophet promised Ezechias a deliverance.  
**12** *Gozan*, in Less Armenia; *Haran* and *Reseph* in Palmerene Syria. *Thelassar*, or Syria. They were nations not very remote. See C. 18:34. C.  
**14** *Before the Lord*, to move him to revenge his own cause, ( H.) and to shew that he looked upon the Lord, as a father, with the utmost confidence ( M.) and resignation. He spreads the blasphemous letter ( H.) before the ark, which was the special place for prayer. W.  
**15** *Earth.* He attempts to make some reparation for the blasphemies which had been uttered ( C.) and written. H.  
**16** *Unto us* is not in Heb. or Sept. D.—*God*, as if he were not able to deliver us. M.  
**21** *Virgin.* The few who adhere to the Lord despise all idols and their votaries. W.—*Of Sion* and *of Je* *rusalem* may denote those places. Towns and provinces are often represented as women: the daughter of Babylon, the daughter of the sea, mean Babylon and a maritime town. Perhaps this comparison is used through tenderness and affection for a place. C.—Even the most timid female would shortly despise the fallen tyrant. H.—*Wagged*, out of contempt, or in a threatening manner. Ps. 21:8. Mat. 27:39. M.  
**22** **V** **er.** **22** **.** *Of Israel.* This title is often found in Isaias; 45:11. and 47:4. &c.  
**23** *Carmel.* A pleasant fruitful hill in the forest. These expressions are figurative, signifying, under the names of mountains and forests, the kings and provinces whom the Assyrians had triumphed over. Ch.—He must have passed by Libanus, and might boast of this exploit. Other proud words to the same purpose are mentioned Isai. 10:9 and 33:9. He had made himself master of Mount Carmel, as well as of Libanus. C.  
**24** *Strange waters*, which did not run in my original dominions, ( H.) or which were found by opening springs before unknown.—*Shut-up*, with mounds of earth, or in the banks of rivers. The army of Xerxes is said to have drunk whole rivers dry. We might also translate, “I have dried up the waters, which served as ramparts for cities.” Thus Cyrus diverted the streams of the Gnidus, and of the Euphrates. Heb. also, perhaps most literally, “I will dry up the rivulets of Egypt.” See Isai. 19:6 and 37:25. C.—Prot. “all the rivers of besieged places.” H.  
**25** *I have formed it*, &c. All thy exploits, in which thou takest pride, are no more than what I have decreed; and are not to be ascribed to thy wisdom or strength, but to my will and ordinance: who have give to thee to take and destroy so many fenced cities, and to carry terror wherever thou comest.—*Ruins.* Literally, “ruin of hills.” Ch.—Prot. “Now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.” H.  
**26** *Of hand.* Heb. “short, ( C.) *or* contracted in hand,” or power. This does not add to the glory of Sennacherib; and if the enemy had been less valiant, the victory was still to be attributed to God. H.—The Assyrian found but little resistance. C. 18:13.  
**27** *In.* All thy actions. M.—*I knew*, or disposed of, for wise purposes. Nothing shews more forcibly the dominion of God, even over the most impious. They cannot frustrate the divine decrees.  
**28** *Ring*, or hook, like that with which fishes are taken. C.—*Bit.* Prot. “bridle,” ( H.) or a sort of muzzle. M.—I will treat thee like a furious beast.—*Camest*, without having effected what thou hadst designed. H.  
**29** *O Ezechias* is not in Heb. or Sept.; but they shew the sense. H.—*Second*, which was a sabbatical year. Usher. T.—We elsewhere find signs given as a proof of past events, and that they were from God, who enabled his prophet to foretell both. Ex. 3:12. Isai. 8:4. Thus three things are proved. 1. That the prophet is truly animated with the divine spirit. 2. That God is the author of the miracle. 3. As also of the sign which follows it, particularly if the sign be likewise miraculous. It was of the utmost importance that the people should be convinced that all proceeded from the hand of Providence, in the overthrow of Sennacherib. C.—*Such things.* Isaias (37:30) specifies *apples*, as they also supplied the people with food. M.  
**30** *Upward*, like a fruitful tree. H.  
**31** *Sion.* These shall repeople the land. In a higher sense, the Christian Church was propagated by the few Jews who believed. C.—*Zeal*, or ardent love. M.—*Of hosts*, is added in the Prot. version, as being deficient in the Heb. H.—It is found in several MSS. Kennicott.  
**32** *About it*, as was then the custom in besieging cities. Josephus and others suppose that Sennacherib’s army was destroyed before Jerusalem. But it seems more probable it fell on the road to Egypt, v. 7. The camp, which is still shewn, might be that of Rabsaces. C. 18:17. C.  
**33** *Return.* Sennacherib’s life was spared for a time, that he might be covered with ignominy the longer, and suffer a more disgraceful death. H.  
**34** *Own sake*, who have chosen this city for my sanctuary. M.—*David.* Here again we behold the influence of the saints with God.  
**35** *Night* following the prediction of Isaias, ( C.) or that memorable night which would be so terrible to the Assyrians after three years, v. 29. Thus we read, *in that day*, &c. Isai. 27. M.—*The* exterminating *angel*, (Ex. 11:4. C.) an evil spirit, (Ps. 77:49) or the guardian of the synagogue. Abulensis.—*When he*, Sennacherib. Heb. &c. “when they,” his few attendants who were spared to announce this judgment; (Isai. 37:36. C.) or when the inhabitants of Jerusalem *arose.* H. It seems the carnage was effected without much noise, ( C.) by fire (Rabbins) or by pestilence. Josephus. M.  
**37** *Nesr* *och.* Jospehus calls both the idol and the temple Araskes. Sennacherib persecuted the Israelites for 45 (Greek 55) days. Toby. 1:21.—*Sons*, as the Jews suppose they were destined for victims by their father, and got beforehand with him. S. Jer. in Isai. x. C.—*Armenia.* So the Prot. translate Ararath, ( H.) where Noe’s ark rested. This nation has been esteemed very warlike, and has always asserted its liberty.—*Asarhaddon.* His two elder brothers were excluded, on account of their parricide. Joseph.—This prince is called *Sargon* in Isai. 20:1 and *Achirdon* in Toby 1:24.

## Chapter 20

**1** *Days*, before the destruction of Sennacherib’s army; (v. 6. M.) though some suppose that Ezechias was afflicted with sickness, because he had not shewn sufficient gratitude for his deliverance. 2 Par. 32:24. Euseb. and S. Jerom in Isai. xxxix. C.—But it might be sent only to purify him the more, &c. M.—He fell ill the same year that the Assyrian invaded his dominions, v. 6, and C. 18:13. The nature of his disorder in not fully known. It was probably an abscess, ( C.) brought on by a fever; or an ulcer, for which the things which promote suppuration, are always proper. Thus God teaches us to make use of natural remedies, yet so as to place our whole confidence in him. H.—Others think it was a pleurisy, (John 21. Thesaur. 26.) or a quinsey, (Barthol.) or the pestilence, &c. C.—*Unto death*, of an illness, which would naturally have proved mortal; as that of Benadad was the reverse. C. 8:10.—*Not live*, very shortly; though he does not express the time. We should always bear in mind this awful warning. H.—The prediction was conditional, like that of Jonas; (3:4. C.) otherwise it would have been sinful to strive to render it ineffectual. E.  
**2** *Wall*, towards the temple; (Chal. &c.) or that he might be less distracted, and indulge his grief without restraint.  
**3** *Before thee.* The saints of the old law frequently mention their good works, (Ps. 7:9. &c. 2 Esd. 13:14) which is less common in those of the new. When God rewards our good works, he only crowns his own gifts. C.—Ezechias had sincerely desired to please God, though he might have given way to some imperfections, v. 1. H.—*Weeping;* because he thought that the Messias would not be one of his posterity, as he had yet no children. C. 21:1. S. Jerom.—The saints of the Old Testament could only be received into Abraham’s bosom. We may *be with Christ* immediately after death; so that it is far less terrible. Phil. 1:23. H.  
**4** *Court.* Heb. her, “city:” but in the margin, ( C.) *etsor.* Sept. αυλη, “hall,” or *court*, is retained, and followed by the Chal. C.—Prot. “the middle court.” H.  
**5** *Day*, dating from the time when Isaias spoke. Tostat.—This shewed that the cure was miraculous, and not effected by natural remedies only. T.  
**6** *Assyrians.* It is commonly supposed that this alludes to Sennacherib. But it might refer to his son, who was sending an army. Isai. 20:1. We ought not to alter the scriptural order of the transactions, without cogent reasons.  
**7** *Figs;* dried. They are very serviceable in various disorders of the throat, to mullify, &c. Pliny xxiii. 3. Aldrov. ii.—S. Jerom (in Isai. xxxviii.) acknowledges that they might help to removed the disorder. Grotius is of a contrary opinion; ( C.) and this would enhance the miracle. See Vales. xxxix. M.—At any rate, the discovery of this remedy to the prophet, and its sudden efficacy, were miraculous. C.  
**8** *Signs.* He is not incredulous, but gives the prophet an occasion of declaring by what authority he spoke thus.  
**10** *Lines*, according to the usual course of the sun. An instantaneous motion of this kind would, in reality, be as difficult, as the retrogradation. But it might not strike the people so much. H.—Some take the lines to designate hours. But the sun is never up twenty hours in that country; and it must have been at such a height, as that it might appear visibly to recede, or to go forward, ten lines. We may therefore suppose, that they consisted only of half hours, ( T.) or less. C.—If the retrograde motion were instantaneous, as Cajetan believes, the day would only be five hours longer than usual; ( M.) but if otherwise, it would be ten; as the sun would occupy five hours in going back, and as many to regain its former station. T.—Usher supposes that the night was as much shortened, that so astronomical observations may still be verified without any confusion. But that would introduce a fresh miracle. Some assert that only the shadow went back, without any derangement in the heavenly bodies. Spinosa laughs at the ignorance of those people, who mistook the effects of a parhelion for a miracle. This author may boast of his superior knowledge. But how came the sages of Babylon (v. 12.) to be unacquainted with such a natural cause? How came it so opportunely ( C.) at the time appointed by the prophet? What improbable explanations are not those forced to admit, who deny to the Almighty the power of changing his own works! H.—The silence of profane historians respecting this miracle, is of little consequence. Herodotus (ii. 142.) seems to hint at it, as well as at that under Josue; (x.) being informed “by the Egyptians, that during 10340 years, the sun had risen four times in an extraordinary manner. It had risen twice where it ought naturally to set, and had set as often where it should rise.” He might have said more simply, that the sun had twice gone back. See Solin, 45. C.—S. Dion. Areop. ep. 7. ad Polycarp.—This last author thinks that this day was twenty hours longer than usual, supposing that the lines designate so many hours, and that the sun kept going back for ten hours. W.  
**11** *Dial.* Heb. also, “steps.” S. Jerom confesses that he followed Sym. in Isai. 38:7. Whether this dial resembled one of ours, (Grotius) or was made in the form of steps, (S. Cyr. hom. 3, in Isaias, &c.) or rather of a half globe, ( C.) after the Babylonian fashion, (Vitruv. ix. 9.) is not clear. Some have asserted that hours were not known to the Hebrews, before the captivity. Usher, A. 3291.—But Toby, (12:22) who wrote at Nineve, under the reign of Manasses, clearly speaks of them. The Egyptians pretend that they invented water hour-glasses. But the invention of dials is attributed to the Chaldees, from whom Anaximander introduced them among the Greeks, under the reign of Cyrus. He died A. 3457.—*Achaz* had much to do with Theglathphalasar; (C. 17:8) and probably obtained this curiosity from the same country. In more ancient times, people measured time by the length of their shadow, and were invited to a feast at such a foot, in the same manner as we should invite for such an hour. Palladius, Rustic. xii. C.—Till the year of Rome 595, when Nasica dedicated the first water hour-glass, the Romans knew not how the time passed on cloudy days. Pliny vii. 60. Vitruvius ix. 9.—Grotius supposes that the dial of Achaz was a concave semicircular gnomon, in which a globe was placed, the shadow of which fell on twenty-eight lines. D.  
**12** *Berodach*, or *Merodac Baladan.* Isai. 39:1. C.—The latter was his father; the famous Nabonassar. D.—*Letters*, or *books.* Isai.—*Sic* *k.* They came to congratulate him on his recovery, and also ( M.) *to inquire of the wonder that had happened upon the earth. God left him that he might be tempted, and all things might be made known tha* *t were in his heart.* 2 Par. 32:31. H.—If this embassage took place after the fall of Sennacherib, the king of Babylon might thank Ezechias for having stopped the career of that ambitious monarch, from whom the former had every thing to fear. C.  
**13** *Rejoiced*, at being honoured by so great a prince, ( M.) who afterwards defeated Asarhaddon. T.—Heb. “hearkened unto them.” But the sense of the Vulg. is preferable, and the construction of the original seems to require it, as it is also understood by the Sept. and Syriac, and by Isaias, 39:2.—*Spices.* Heb. “precious things,” (Mont.) “treasures,” (Chal. Syr.) “cabinet” of jewels, &c. Vatable.—*Vessels*, or armour, and all this fine furniture. S. Jerom says, that Ezechias also displayed before them the treasures of the temple, which chiefly drew upon him God’s displeasure. C.—He might be guilty only of a venial sin of vanity and of ingratitude: ( M.) and God took occasion, from this offence to admonish the king of the impending ruin. D.  
**17** **7** **.** *Babylon*, under the last kings of Juda. It cannot be explained of Sennacherib. C. 18:15.  
**18** *Eunuchs;* servants. Dan. 1:3. We only read of Manasses, who was taken to *Babylon.* C.—But he might have many brothers, who might be reduced to a menial condition; (Salien) as the text seems to refer to the immediate sons of Ezechias. H.—It may, however, be explained of his descendants. M. C. 24:12.  
**19** **Ve** **r.** **19** **.** *Let.* Heb. “and he added, let,” &c. C.—Prot. “he said, *is it* not *good*, if peace and truth (or a solid and desirable peace) be in my days?” He is not indifferent about his family, as the Jews would insinuate (Eus. and S. Jer. in Isai. xxxix. 7. 8) from the prophet’s adding, *Be comforted … my people;* (C. 40:1. H.) but he submits with resignation to God’s decrees, (S. Ambrose) and begs that God would be pleased to suffer him to die in peace, as the sentence did not seem to affect his person. H.—Josephus insinuates that he was exceedingly grieved at the distress which hung over his posterity, (Ant. x. 3.) and we are assured the Ezechias and the people entered into sentiments of humility and penance, which for a time averted the wrath of God. 2 Par. 32:26.  
**20** *City.* Probably before it was besieged by Sennacherib. 2 Par. 32:4.—*Juda*, and in the works of Isaias. Ibid. 32:32. Isaias 37 and 38 and 39. The prophet gives us the canticle of this pious king, who shone with so great splendour, and did so much for the good of his people. C. 18:4. 5. Eccli. 48:19. C.—He generously opposed the reign of vice, and though threatened with the most imminent dangers, came off with victory. Thus Jesus Christ declared war against idolatry and all vice, and established his Church in the midst of persecution. H.—Ezechias was conducted to the gates of death, and brought back; Christ rose victorious from the grave, as the holy king seems to have foreseen. Isai. 38:19. C.

## Chapter 21

**1** *Twelve.* Being born three years after his father’s recovery.—*Fifty.* Including the years of captivity.  
**2** *Idols.* Heb. “abominations,” ( C.) as their worship was attended with the greatest infamy and dissolution, and was in itself the source of God’s chastisements. H.  
**3** *Groves.* Heb. Ashera, “the grove,” or the idol of Astarte, ( C.) as both were worshipped. H.—*Achab*, whom he imitated also in spilling the blood of the saints. M.  
**4** *Altars*, in honour of the sun, moon, and stars, ( H.) in the *courts* of the priests and of the people. 2 Par. 33:4.  
**6** *Fire*, for purification, or as a holocaust to Moloch. See C. 16:3.—*Divination*, or, “he observed times,” Arab. Mont.—*Omens.* Prot. “used enchantments,” ( H.) by means of brass or of serpents, &c. C.—Sept. agrees with the Vulg. “he took notice of birds.” H.—*Pythons.* That is, diviners by spirits ( Ch). particularly by Apollo. He authorized and encouraged such ventriloquists, &c. Lev. 19:31.—*Soothsayers*, who inspected the entrails of victims, to foretell future things. C.—Prot. “He dealt with familiar spirits and wizards.” H.  
**7** *Of the grove.* Heb. “a graven thing of Ashera,” the grove or Astarte, ( H.) v. 3. This was an engraving in sculpture of a sacred grove. Sa. C. 23:6. T.—*My name.* I alone will be adored, and there allow an altar to be erected. H.  
**9** *More*, because they had received more favours and instructions from above. W.  
**10** *Prophets*, Joel, Osee, Amos, Nahum, Jonas, Abdias, Micheas, and particularly by Isaias, who was related to the king. T.—Tradition informs us, that Manasses was so irritated, that he ordered Isaias to be slain with a wooden saw, (S. Aug. de C. D. xviii. 24.) for greater torment; ( C.) and his companions were daily executed, Joseph. x. 3.—Isaias (22:13) seems to pronounce his sin irremissible, ( C.) or that he should not, at least, escape the punishment of it, as long as he lived. But we are assured that the eyes of Manasses were at last opened by adversity, and that he performed many laudable things after his return from captivity; (2 Par. 33) so that the latter part of his reign resembled that of his father; though the beginning had been like that of the impious Achab. His coming to the throne so soon, before his pious father could have time to impress upon his mind the truths of salvation, had nearly proved his ruin. *The sins of my youth, and my igno* *rances, remember not, O Lord*, Ps. 24:7. H.  
**11** *Doings.* Heb. “idols,” v. 2. See C. 17:12. H.  
**12** *Tingle*, through astonishment, as if he had been stunned with too loud a sound. 1 K. 3:11. C.  
**13** **V** **er.** **13** **.** *The line*, or rope, to pull down the walls, Lament. 2:8. ( C.) 2 K. 17:13. Jerusalem, which has imitated Samaria in sinning, shall experience the same fate; the same *weight* of punishment shall fall upon the royal family, as upon the *house of Achab.* H.—The prophets frequently entitle their menaces a weight, or burden. Isai. 13:1. M.—Sept. have, “the balance of the house, &c.” as if God had weighed all the good and evil, and would now reward the people accordingly, ( H.) with judgment. D.—*Table*, or board, covered with wax. The ancients were accustomed to write in this manner with a style which was sharp at one end and blunt at the other. *Altera pars revocat quicquid pars altera fecit* *.* Ænig. Symponii. When the wax was rendered smooth, no *vestige* of the former writing could appear, and God threatened to destroy Jerusalem, in like manner. Heb. is variously translated. C.—Sept. “I will wipe out Jerusalem as an alabaster vase is wiped, and turned downwards.” Prot. “as *a man* wipeth a dish, wiping *it* and turning *it* upside down.” H.—*Often.* 1. Under Manasses; 2. under Josias and Joachaz; 3. under the last kings of Juda. 2 Par. 23. &c. T.  
**14** *Leave.* Sept. “with horror,” απεασομαι ( H.) “I will cast off.” So Chal. Syr. &c.—*Remnants.* Juda, &c. who shall be treated like the ten tribes. C.—All shared in the punishment, though some preserved the true religion. Ps. 88:35. W.  
**16** *Mo* *uth.* Chal. “extremity.” All was full of blood, and impure idols, v. 11.—*Besides*, (*absque*) “without” mentioning his other scandalous sins of idolatry.  
**17** *Sinned.* It is rather wonderful that his repentance is not here noticed; but we find it mentioned 2 Par. 33:12. H.—He was probably taken prisoner by Thartan, general of Sargon, or Asarhaddon, who had reunited the two kingdoms of Assyria and Babylon. Isai. 20:1. In prison Manasses composed a penitential prayer, which is not absolutely rejected by the Church, but left in the rank of Apocryphal writings; ( C.) the authority of which is not clearly ascertained. H.—The Greek church admits this prayer into her Euchologium, ( C.) or Office-book. H.—Being liberated, probably by Saosduchin, Manasses did all things well, only he left the high places, where the people had been accustomed to sacrifice to the Lord. Hozai wrote his history. 2 Par. 33:19.  
**18** *Oza*, a private man, to whom it had belonged; ( M.) or the place where the Levite had been punished for touching the ark; (1 K. 6:8) or, in fine, the garden to which king Ozias had retired after he became a leper. C.—It is said, that Manasses chose this place for his tomb out of humility. Grotius.  
**20** *Done*, in his youth, flattering himself that he should also repent, when he had gratified his passions (Glycas) but God presently chastised this presumption, after suffering him to reign only two years. T.

**1** *Eight years.* After he had reigned other eight, being still but a boy, he began more seriously to seek the Lord, and purified his dominions, and the neighbouring country, from all the vestiges of idolatry. 2 Par. 33:3. He was one of the three most excellent kings of Juda, ( H.) and might be said to be the last; as those who followed were displaced at pleasure by Egypt, &c. D.  
**3** *Scribe of.* Heb. “to the temple.” Chal. Syr. &c. It is not certain that there was such an officer as scribe of the temple; but the king’s secretary was ordered by Joas to take an account of the money contributed, C. 12:10. C.—Josias followed the same plan. T.  
**4** *Together*, so as to be reduced into a mass, and refined by fire. Pagnin.—Sept. “seal up the money.” Prot. “that he may sum the silver which,” &c. H.—Let him make all be paid up that is due, (Piscat.) and cease to demand any more.—*Door-keepers.* Their office was of some consequence. 1 Par. 9:26. 29. C.  
**5** *Overseers*, or undertakers. Grotius.—People of the great respectability were selected, so that no reckoning with them was requisite, v. 7. H.—They were thus encouraged to do the work with greater perfection. C.  
**8** *Th* *e book of the law*, (that is, Deuteronomy. Ch.—S. Chrys. hom. 9. in Mat.) or the Pentateuch. Joseph.—Achaz, Manasses, and Amon, had burnt (R. Solomon) as many copies as they could, ( H.) but some zealous priests had concealed this copy, in a box, in the wall of the temple, (Lyran) or in the treasury adjoining it. The very hand writing of Moses, containing the record of the covenant, (or the 28, 29, 30, and 31st chapters of Deuteronomy) which was placed in ( C.) or beside the ark, was now happily discovered. H.—It seems it had been misplaced, as the ark itself had been removed, 2 Par. 24:14 and 35:3. This venerable monument, and the dreadful menaces which it denounced, made the deepest impression upon all, as we should read the autographs of S. Matthew, &c. with far greater respect and emotion than we do the printed copies. It is not at all probably that all the books of Scripture had been destroyed, as there were always some religious souls in both kingdoms; and if some kings had already made the impious attempt, ( H.) of which, however, they are never accused in Scripture, they would not have been able to carry their malicious designs into effect. Josias had, before his 18th year, made many excellent regulations, conformably to the law, which was well understood, and carefully preserved by the priests and prophets. C. 2 Par. 17:9.—*Read it.* Scribes were generally chosen from among the Levites. C.  
**11** *Garments*, through zeal for God’s honour, and fear of his indignation. M.  
**14** *Holda.* She is known only by this honourable embassy. It is rather wonderful that Jeremias was not consulted, as he had began to prophesy five years before. But he probably resided at Anathoth. Sophonias appeared, perhaps, only towards the end of the reign of Josias. C.—*The Second*, a street, or part of the city so called; in Hebrew, Massem. Ch.—The Sept. retain this word, ( M.) or rather, “in Masena;” Heb. mishne. H.—Manasses inclosed Jerusalem with a second wall, (2 Par. 33:14. C.) unless this was done by his father, ib. 32:5. T.—Here Holda is said to have kept a school. C.—Chal. “the house of doctrine,” a lace next in importance to the temple. Vatab.—S. Jerom speaks of this *Second*, as of a gate, or part of Jerusalem, between the inner and the outer wall. C. Pelag, 2 Irad. in 2 Par. and in Sophon. i. 10. M.  
**20** *Peace*, before these horrors overtake the city. Josias was interred with all the usual honours, have fallen in battle. C. 23:29. C.—Instead of peace, the Alex. Sept. reads, “in Jerusalem,” to which city Josias was brought from Mageddo, where he had perhaps rashly attacked the king of Egypt, with whom he had not been engaged in war. H.—This last good king was given to Juda, that he people might not pretend that they were forced to embrace idolatry by the royal power. S. Jer. D.

## Chapter 23

**2** *Prophets.* Chal. “scribes.” But there were many prophets at this time, who were ordered to come and renew the covenant with God.—*He read*, in person, acting as a mediator, in imitation of Moses, Josue, Samuel, Joiada, and Ezechias. C.  
**3** *The step.* His tribune or tribunal, a more eminent place, from whence he might be seen and heard by the people. Ch.—This brazen tribune is described C. 11:14. 2 Par. 6:12.—*To the covenant*, but with much less exactitude than the king. C.  
**4** *Order*, who presided over the 24 classes of inferior priests. M.—Jonathas understands it of those who supplied the place of the high priest when he could not attend. Grotius.—*Baal*, the sun: ( C.) in Heb. “for.”—*The grove*, Astarte, or the moon. H.—*Cedron*, to the east and south of Jerusalem, where Topheth and the sepulchres of the poor, and all unclean things, were placed. Here the pagans burnt their children in honour of Moloch. See 3 K. 15:13. 2 Par. 29:16 and 30:14.—*Bethel*, out of contempt for the golden calf, ( H.) and to remove those impurities to a greater distance. C.  
**5** *Soothsayers.* Prot. “the idolatrous priests.” Grotius thinks that camilli, or “ministers of the gods,” (Serv. and Varro. vi.) may be derived from the Heb. hacemarim, “the black-vested,” or cryers. The Rabbins give this title in derision to the religious of the Christian Church. There were some melanophori, or people “in black,” who honoured Isis, or the moon, by this dress; as if to condole with her on the absence of the sun. Plutarch Apuleius describes a shining black veil, which was carried in the procession of her statue.—*Baal.* Heb. “to Baal the son;” ( C.) or rather, “to Baal, to the son.” H.—The Heb. mazatoth, ( C.) Sept. *Mazouroth* ( H.) is not better understood. S. Jerom translates *signs* of the zodiac; others have, influences, planets, Lucifer, Venus, &c. Job (38:32) designates some stars by the name of Mozruth, and Mozrim. C.  
**6** *Grove.* The idol of Astarte, or the representation of a grove in sculpture. H.—*People*, who were not rich enough to have a sepulchre. Jeremias (19:11) threatens the people of Jerusalem with such a burial. C.—The *common people* here means the idolaters. 2 Par. 34:4. H.  
**7** *Effeminate.* Heb. “consecrated” ( C.) or “initiated” (Mont.) in the obscene mysteries of idols. See Deut. 23:18 and 3 K. 15:12 and 2 Mac. 6:4. These men prostituted themselves ( M.) even in that sacred place. C.—Prot. “he broke down the houses of the Sodomites, that were by the house of the Lord, where the women wove hangings for the grove.” These hangings, tents, or dwellings, ( H.) were destined for the idol; (Syr. &c.) or they were intended to hid the abominations which were committed. They were called “tents of the daughters,” C. 17:30. C.—*For.* Lit. “of the grove:” *luci.* But the other translation is conformable to the Sept. Vatable, &c. H.  
**8** *Bersabee;* to which the Israelites went in pilgrimages, Amos 5:5. This place was situated at the southern extremity of the dominions of Juda, as Gabaa was at the northern. The *priests* being unable to offer sacrifice in the temple, and desirous to gain a livelihood, had been so weak as to conform to the illegal practices of the country; though they seem to have intended to worship *God.* Deut. 12:11.—*Altars.* These might also be consecrated to the true God, but they were forbidden. There were others, placed in similar situations, in honour of Trivia, or the moon. Isai. 57:8 and 65:11. C.—*City*, to a person entering. Chal. Josue was the chief lay-judge, or magistrate. M.  
**9** *Brethren.* Thus people are degraded in the Christian Church, that they may suffer some confusion ( C.) in this world, and repent. H.—The priests, who had offered sacrifice unlawfully, where only permitted to perform the minor offices; but provision was made for their support, that they might not be tempted to relapse. Lev. 21:17. 22. Ezec. 44:10. C.—They were reduced to the rank of Levites. M.  
**10** *Defiled*, or declared it unlawful. M.—Topheth may signify “a drum;” which the Jews say the idolaters beat, to prevent their childrens’ cries from being heard, when they were burning in the arms of Moloch. S. Jerom interprets it “latitude,” as the vale was very wide, and beautifully adorned with gardens and springs. It formed a part of the vale of Josaphat and of Cedron; ( C.) or the same valley went by these different names, as well as ( H.) by that of Geh-hinnon, “the vale of Ennom,” whence Gehenna is formed, and applied to hell. Matt. 5:22. Mark 9:44. &c. C.—Yet some think that the term denotes a place of torment on earth, which those deserve who say, *thou fool.* H.  
**11** *Nathan-melech.* Sept. “to the treasury (room. Pagnin) of Nathan, the king’s eunuch,” or chamberlain. H.—*Pharurim*, “the suburbs.” Vatable. M. Chal.—It perhaps denotes the guard-house. See 1 Par. 26:18.—*Chariots.* The aforesaid horses were designed to draw them in honour of the sun. Some nations used to ride in this manner with all expedition, at its rising; and the Rabbins pretend that the king, or some other by his order, had been accustomed to ride from the eastern gate of the temple to the house of the governor, Nathan-melech. The horse was consecrated to the sun, on account of its agility.  
**12** *Upper chamber*, to be nearer the *host of heaven*, which they adored. H.—We are assured that the Arabs also adored the sun, and offered incense to it on the tops of their houses. The prophets often upbraid the people with this practice. Jer. 19:13. Soph. 1:5. C.—It is wonderful that Ezechias had not before removed these remnants of his father’s infidelity; and still more that *Manasses*, after his repentance, had not destroyed what he had unlawfully erected in the *courts* of the priests and of the people. But Amon might have restored them.—*Ran.* This shews the zeal of the king. Heb. and Sept. “and thence he broke *or* tore them.”  
**13** *Offence;* Olivet. H.—In the original, the terms are very much alike; and the Jews take a pleasure in deforming names, for which they had a horror. Solomon had erected temples here to various idols, (3 K. 11:7) which had probably been demolished by Ezechias, but had been rebuilt under Amon, &c. and subsisted during the minority of Josias; ( C.) or they had been neglected by the pious kings of Juda, as no longer dangerous. But Josias, in the fervour of his zeal, thought proper to remove every thing that had been the occasion of *offence:* Heb. “of corruption.”—*Idol*, and *scandal*, and *abomination*, are the same in Heb.  
**14** *Statues* is more proper than the Prot. “images,” which would rather be torn.—*Dead* is not expressed in the Heb. or Sept. but must be understood. H.—The pagans had the same idea of their impurity: *incestat funere classem* *.* Virgil, Æneid vi.  
**15** *Bethel* had perhaps fallen into the hands of Juda, after the Israelites had been led away. C.—Josias exercised the like authority throughout all Samaria, (v. 19.) as the country properly belonged to the house of David, and was God’s peculiar inheritance. H.—We may, therefore conclude that He authorized Josias to act in this manner; and the new inhabitants had no interest in maintaining the superstition of those who had lived there before them. The priest sent by Asarhaddon, had taken up his residence at Bethel; whence it is inferred that the town, at that time, was in the hands of the Samaritans, ( C.) as it might be still, though Josias might exercise dominion in it as lord paramount. H.  
**16** *Spoke.* Sept. subjoin some words, which seem to be lost in the original: [“when Jeroboam was standing, on the festival day, upon the altar. And turning, he lifted up his eyes towards the tomb of the man of God,] who spoke these words.” H.—“The copies, from which this version was made, read differently from the modern copies,” and often better. Kennicott, diss. ii. p. 335.  
**17** *Monument.* Heb. tsiun, “an eminence” of “dry” earth, (Ezec. 39:15) heaped upon a corpse; whence the Latin *tumulus* *.* Servius. C.—It seems some inscription was still to be seen on the tomb. M.—*Thou*, &c. Sept. “which he proclaimed against the altar.” H.  
**18** *Samaria.* It seems this word has been inserted instead of Juda, as it is certain the prophet came thence, v. 17 and 3 K. 13:32. C.—But thus both prophets would be identified. It would rather appear that the seducing *prophet*, who resided at Bethel, is here said to have *come out of Samaria*, though that place was not raised to the dignity of a royal city ( H.) till 50 years afterwards. C.—There might be a town there long before; and, at any rate, he belonged to the kingdom to Jeroboam, or of Samaria. H.—His faith in the prophet’s prediction was, perhaps, thus rewarded, ( M.) as his bones were left unmolested, on account of their being buried in the same sepulchre with the man of God. H.  
**20** *Slew.* Most of the Israelites who had been left, ( H.) embraced the true religion, after the captivity of their brethren, ( C.) and adhered to the kings of Juda, (v. 15. H.) who had taken possession of the whole country ( D.) after the fall of the Assyrian empire; ( T.) unless the emperors of Chaldea had given it to them as to their vassels. See v. 29. C.  
**21** *Covenant*, in Deuteronomy, C. 22:8. M.  
**22** *No* *such*, is all respects. H.—The number of paschal lambs was certainly greater when all Israel was assembled; but the other victims presented by the king and his officers during the octave is here noticed, (2 Par. 35:7. M.) as they are also styled the Phase; ( H.) and this explains Jo. 18:28. T.—Neither ought we to push these expressions too far, as they only mean, that this solemnity was very great. See v. 25. C. 18:5. C.  
**24** *Spirits.* Lit. “the pythons.” Deut. 18:11; Num. 22:5.—*Idols.* Heb. Teraphim*;* Prot. “images,” Gen. 21:19.—*Uncleannesses.* Heb. &c. “idols.”  
**25** *Like him.* Every person has some peculiarity, which distinguishes him from every other. H.—Thus we say of many saints: *There was none found like unto him.* Eccli. 44:20. T.  
**26** *Had provoked him.* The impiety of this king must have been extreme, since his repentance did not avert the scourge. H.—Besides, many of the people were corrupt at heart, though they were afraid of shewing it, as we learn from the prophets Jeremias and Sophonias. God therefore withdrew the good Josias, who was their bulwark, that they might feel the effects of his just indignation. C.  
**29** *Nechao*, six years (Usher, A. 3394.) after he had succeeded his father Psammetichus, with whose ambitious views hew as animated to attempt the conquest of Asia. Marsham sæc. 18. Pharao pretends that God had sent him to attack the Assyrians. 2 Par. 35:21. But Josias thought he was only imposing on him, or speaking through fear. The Jews assert that Jeremias also opposed the king’s design. 3 Esd. 1:28. S. Jer. ad Ctesip. But this does not appear from the canonical Scripture. C.—*Meet him*, in order to hinder him from passing through his dominions without leave; as this might prove dangerous. H.—*Seen him*, and fought. M.—He received a *mortal* wound at Mageddo, but did at Jerusalem. 2 Par. 35:23. Joseph. x. 6.—Mageddo lay to the south of Cison, where Barak had fought before. Judg. 5:19. Herodotus (ii. 159.) says, that Nechos gained a victory over the Syrians at Magdolum, and took Cadytis, which is probably Cades, a strong city of Galilee, though some take it to be Jerusalem, as it may be interpreted “the holy city.” C.—Mageddo is called Magdala in the Greek, and Magedan in other copies, and in the Vulg. Mat. 15:39.  
**30** *Sepulchre.* Par. 35. *in the monument* (or mausoleum) *of his fathers.* Such was the end of Josias: he fell gloriously in defence of his country, as he had spent his life in promoting religion. God therefore withdrew him from the sight of the miseries which were shortly to fall on his devoted people. C. 22:20. H.—He was a prince of most excellent disposition, and receives the highest encomium, v. 25 and Eccli. 49:1. Jeremias composed his funeral canticle, which was sung on his anniversary for many years. 2 Par. 35:24. The mourning for this pious king became proverbial, and resembled that which should be made for the Messias. Zac. 12:11. The life and death of Josias prefigured those of Jesus Christ; who should be long expected as the restorer of the true religion, the teacher of a more excellent law, and the most innocent victim for the sins of the people. The glorious Phase under Josias, was but a faint representation of the eucharistic sacrifice. C.  
**31** *Old.* Eliacim his brother was 25. H.—Perhaps Joachaz was esteemed more by the people, as fitter to defend them against the king of Egypt, who had proceeded on his journey to attack Charchamis on the Euphrates. C.—Having placed a garrison in it, he was met by Joachaz, and gained a victory over him at Rebla, ( H.) as Sanctius gathers from Ezec. 19:4. Hence he treated the captive king with such severity, and sent him into Egypt to die in chains. Jer. 22:11. Joachaz is called Sellum (in Jer.) and Jechonias, 3 Esd. 1:34. C.—He was a lion only against his own subjects. T.  
**33** Rebla*.* Syr. and Arab. “Deblat;” probably ( C.) Apamea on the Orontes. Chal. on Num. xxxiv. 11.  
**34** *Joakim.* Thus he asserted his dominion over him, as Nabuchodonosor did afterwards over Matthanias. C. 24:17. Daniel 1:6. C.—Eliacim means nearly the same as Joakim, “the Lord’s strength,” or “appointment.” M.  
**36** *Old*, of course Josias had him at 15. Some suspect we ought to read 15 here. D.  
**37** *Fathers*, or ancestors, not his immediate father Josias, v. 32. H.—Joakim chose to imitate the wicked, and was not deterred by the chastisement of his brother. C.—His character was marked with avarice and cruelty. He slew the prophet Urias. Jer. 22:13 and 26:23. H.—S. Matthew 1:11. calls him Jechonias. ( M.) 1 Par. 3:15.

## Chapter 24

**1** *Days.* At the end of the third year. Dan. 1:1. Jer. 25:1. *Nabuchadonosor*, in the first year of his reign, (Jer. ib.) being associated in the empire by his aged father Nabopolassar, *c* *ame up* to attack Carchemis, (Jer. 46:1) and the other dominions of Egypt, (v. 7.) and their ally or vassal *Joakim.* He took the city of Jerusalem, and carried off many of the sacred vessels, and captives, (Dan. 1. C.) conducting the king himself to prison, for a short time, when he set him at liberty, on condition that he should pay tribute. 2 Par. 36:6. T.—Joakim obeyed for 3 *years.*—*Then again.* Heb. “he turned and rebelled.” This was the first time, as he had before been subject to Egypt, and was attacked no that account. He probably took advantage of the absence of Nabuchodonosor, who was gone with haste to secure all the dominions of his deceased father. In the 7th year of his reign, he sent *rovers* to punish Joakim. When the latter had reigned near 11 years, they reduced the kingdom, and treated the king’s corpse with the utmost indignity. Jer. 22:19. T.  
**2** *The rovers. Latrunculos* *.* Bands or parties of men, who pillaged and plundered wherever they came. Ch. See C. 5:2. and Judg. 11:3.—Nabuchodonosor could not come in person.—*Prophets.* Holda, sup. C. 22:16. Isaias C. 21:17. Jeremias 14. 15. 16. &c.  
**5** *Did.* Paral. *And his abominations which he wrought, and the things which* *were found in him.* This S. Jerom, (Trad.) explains of certain diabolical marks on his body, shewing him to be devoted to the fiend Codonasar. Suchar are often found on magicians. M.—Thus the priests of Baal cut themselves. 3 K. 18:28. H.  
**6** *Joachin*, who is styled Jechonias, Mat. 1 and Conias Jer. 22:24. The prophet counts his reign as nothing, because it was so limited by the Chaldees, and continued only three months. Jer. 36:30.  
**7** *Egypt*, at least from the eastern mouth of the Nile, at Damietta, to the Euphrates. Nechao had conquered all those countries: but now he was driven into his ancient territories. After *some time* he attempted to relieve Sedecias, but war repulsed by Nabuchodonosor, who soon after took Jerusalem, Jer. 37:6. C.—*Again*, during the reign of Joachin. D.  
**8** *Eighteen.* One Heb. MS. reads “thirteen,” ( H.) or 3 instead of 8. Kennicott.—The number seems also ( H.) to be incorrect in Paral. where we find that Joachin was only *eight* years old, as the Syr. and Arab. have 18 in both places, and it could not well be said, that he *did evil*, &c. (v. 9.) at the age of 8, much less that he had *wives* so soon, v. 15. C.—Some attempt to reconcile both places, by saying that the eight years refer to the commencement of his father’s reign; (Jun.) which is very unusual: ( C.) or to the servitude of Babylon, when Jerusalem was taken under Joakim. Hardouin.—Sanctius conjectures that Joachin was associated with his father when he was 10 years old, and after 8 years became sole king. Kimchi, &c. D.  
**9** *Done.* Ezechiel 19:5 and Jeremias 22:24 speak of this king under the name of ( H.) Jechonias. C.  
**10** *Came.* Heb. “servants … he came.” But several MSS. are more accurate and grammatical, “they came.” Kennicott. H.  
**12** *Went out.* Josephus (Bel. vi. 8.) insinuates, to save the vessels of the temple.—Jeremias had persuaded him to desist from making resistance. T.—Nabuchodonosor did not comply with his promise, ( M.) but took the king and all the artificers (v. 14.) to Babylon, that the former might not attempt to revenge the injuries done to his father, nor the latter contribute to fortify the towns. The Philistines had deprived the Israelites of blacksmiths, with the same design. 1 K. 7 and 13. Angelomus. T.—*Eighth;* commencing, or at the end of the *seventh.* Jer. 52. D.  
**13** *All*, or a great part; for some were still left. 1 Esd. 1.—*Which:* or like unto those which *Solomon had made.* The identical vessels had been perhaps ( D.) plundered. M.—Nabuchodonosor took away the sacred vessels at three different times: 1. under Joakim. These he placed in the temple of his god; and they were afterwards profaned by Baltassar, and restored by Cyrus. Dan. 1:2 and 5:2 and 1 Esd. 1:7. 2. Many he now broke in pieces. 3. Under Sedecias, he took probably what that prince had made. C. 25:13. Bar. 1:7—*Lord*, by Isaias (39:6. Sup. C. 20:17) and Jeremias, 15:13.  
**14** *All;* the chief men. C. 25:18. Ezechiel and Mardocheus were in the number.—*Engraver.* The first term means a workman in wood, stone, &c.; the latter seems to designate a mason, smith, or garrison-soldier; ( C.) or one expert in making camps; (Sa.) an engineer. T.—S. Jerom explains it of one who enchases jewels in gold. M.—Hecateus and Demetrius (ap. Jos. and Clem. Alex.) mention this transportation. D.  
**15** *Judges.* Heb. “the rams.” Chal. “the grandees.” These are not included in the 10,000, (v. 14.) nor more than ( C.) the 8,000 who were taken from the country (v. 16. C.;) or 3,000 were taken from Jerusalem, and 7,000 from other places. D.  
**17** *Uncle*, the third son of Josias, who was placed on the throne. H.—The eldest, ( M.) called Johanan, seems to have died in his youth. C.—*Sedecias* means, “the justice of God,” ( T.) as Nabuchodonosor had adjured him, or *made him swear* *by God;* (2 Par. 36:15. H.) and thus insinuated, that, if he proved faithless, he should feel the effects of God’s justice, as it happened. T.  
**19** *Done.* He was not deterred by his punishment, nor by the admonition of Jeremias, 37:2. and 2 Par. 36:12. The prophet informs us, that the priests and people defiled the temple of God. See Ezechiel 8. &c. C.  
**20** *Revolted.* Lit. “departed;” ( H.) “broke his covenant;” (Sept.) acting contrary to his oath, (Par.) and to the dictates of prudence. God permitted this to take place, in the 8th year of Sedecias. C.

## Chapter 25

**1** *Day*, the 30th of January, A. 3414. Usher.—Some time after Nabuchodonosor left the siege, to attack the Egyptians; (Jer. 37:3) and the people of Jerusalem, ( H.) supposing that he would return no more, took back their slaves, whom Jeremias had prevailed on them to liberate, according to the law, during the sabbatical year. Jer. 34:8. Usher.—The prophet reproached them for it; and announced the destruction of the city so plainly, that he was thrown into prison. Jer. 21 and 34 and 38.—*It.* The Babylonians had already taken all the towns of Juda, except Azeca and Lachis. Jer. 34:7. C.  
**3** *Of the.* Prot. supply, “*fourth* month,” as it is in the parallel passage. Jer. 52:6. *And in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month.* In C. 39:2, we read, *in the fourth month, the fifth* *day of the month, the city was broken up*, or a breach was made in the outer wall. In the course of a few days, the *princes* of Babylon seized *the middle gate;* and the famine became so intolerable, that, on the 9th, it was judged expedient to abandon the city. H.—During this siege it is thought, ( C.) that mothers eat their children, (Lam. 4:10. Bar. 2:3) and children their parents. Ezechiel 5:10. M.  
**4** *Walls*, by a subterraneous passage, to the plains of Jericho; (Rabbins) or by the horse gate, which was the most private, and, it seems, had been walled up. Ezec. 12:12. M.  
**6** *Rablatha*, the Antioch of Syria, (S. Jer.) which was styled also Ephiphania, ( T.) or more probably Apamea, where Nabuchodonosor was, when Jerusalem was taken.—*Upon him*, by the advice of his council. Jer. 39:3. 13. Syr. “they made him answer the charges brought against him,” ( C.) of ingratitude and rebellion, as he had been appointed by the king of Babylon, and had sworn to be faithful to him. M.—This repeated infidelity made Nabuchodonosor resolve to remove the people from their own country. C.—He sentenced the last of the kings of Juda to see his children slain, ( H.) to have his eyes put out, and to remain in prison till his death. Jer. 52:11. &c. C.—Heb. he “spake judgments with him.” Thus was accomplished the prediction of Jeremias, (34:3.) “thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak to thee.” Watson.—The same prophet had said the same (C. 32:4) before he was throne into prison. The sight of an angry judge is no small punishment. H.  
**7** *Eyes;* after they had been excruciated by the sight of his slaughtered children. He thus might be convinced, that there was no reason to despise the predictions of Jeremias and of Ezechiel, (12:13) as contradictory, because the latter informed him that he should not *see* Babylon; though the other said that he should *die* there.—*Babylon*, where he was honourably buried, by order of Nabuchodonosor. Joseph. x. 11.—Seder (Olam xxviii.) records that his attendants sung, at his funeral, “Alas! king Sedecias is dead, having drunk the dregs of all ages;” as he suffered also for the crimes of his predecessors. Genebrard. T.—This is not indeed specified in Scripture: ( H.) but it is highly probable that Nabuchodonosor would thus “revere royalty, even in its ruins,” if Daniel and the other Jews in power, had not been careful to shew this mark of respect to their deceased monarch, conformably to the prediction of Jeremias; (34:3) who foretold that he should die, not by a violent death, the usual fate of captive kings, but *in peace*, or on his bed, though in a prison. Watson, let. 6.  
**8** *Seventh.* Jeremias (52:12) mentions the *tenth;* on which day Nabuzardan probably arrived, or begun to put his orders in execution. Yet the Jews keep the ninth as an annual fast. Zac. 7:3 and 8:19. The temple was destroyed on Saturday, 27th August, A. 3416, (Usher) after it had stood 424 years, 3 months, and 8 days. C.—*Army.* Heb. “of those who slay;” which may be fitly understood “of soldiers,” as well as “of cooks,” (Sept.) “butchers.” Pagnin, &c. M.  
**9** *Great.* This word is supplied from Jer. 52:13 and Heb. “great *man’s* house.” Prot. But Jer. 39:8, we read, they *burnt the houses of the people*, ( H.) even the meanest, destroyed the walls, and took the people to Babylon, only leaving some countrymen to cultivate the land. Jeremias was set at liberty by Nabuzardan, (ib. 11) and chose to continue with this *remnant of the people*, for their comfort and direction. H.—They applied to him to know whether they should retire into Egypt; and after ten days, he gave them God’s injunction to the contrary: but they despised it. Jer. 42:7 and 43:1. The prophet, and his secretary, Baruch, followed them into Egypt. Thus was the country abandoned, and the monarchy at an end, after it had subsisted 468 years from the commencement of David’s reign. C.—Yet some little power remained in the family of David, even at Babylon; (v. 27.) and the Jewish affairs were re-established, after the captivity, though not in such splendour as formerly, nor always under princes of the same royal family. H.  
**14** *Mazers.* Heb. yahim, “shovels.” Prot. Sept. retain the original word, which S. Jerom translates differently. See 3 K. 7:50. ( M.) and Exodus.  
**18** *Saraias*, father of Esdras, and of Josedeck, who succeeded in the Pontificate, 1 Esd. 7:1. and 1 Par. 6:14. T.—*Sophonias.* He was perhaps chief of the fourth band of door-keepers, mentioned 1 Par. 9:17. 24 and vice-gerent of the High-priest, to supply his place, in case of any accident. We find no mention of such a priest in the law, but Eleazar possessed a similar power, Num. 3:32. C.—*Keepers.* These seem to have concealed themselves in the temple. M.—They were punished, as the counsellors of Sedecias, by being beheaded or crucified. Lam. 5:12. T.  
**19** *Eunuch.* Prot. “officer.” H.—*Five.* Arab. and Jeremias 52:25 read *seven*, as two were probably discovered afterwards, ( C.) or had fled. D.—These were chief officers.—*Sopher* *.* Sept. “and the secretary of the general.” Syr. “the secretary and chiefs of the armies.” C.—Prot. “the principal scribe.” H.—It is not clear whether the general have this title of *sopher*, “scribe,” himself; or it rather designates his secretary, or scribe. Judg. 8:14. C.—Many date the 70 years captivity from the last year of Joachin. D.  
**22** *Godolias.* The Rabbins say that he had gone over to the Chaldees: Jeremias (37:2, 17) had advised all to do so, and Godolias was of an easy complying disposition. Grotius.—But God did not suffer him to collect the remnants of his unhappy people, ( C.) at least for any long time, as he was slain by Ismael, (Jer. 40:12 and 41:1. H.) who probably envied his dignity. Joseph. Salien.  
**26** *Chaldees.* They went under the conduct of Johanan, in opposition to the declaration of Jeremias, 43:7. and 44:1. C.  
**27** *Twentieth.* Jeremias (52:31) says *the 25th*, when Nabuchodonosor was buried, and ( D.) the decree was made, though it was not put in execution till two days later. C.—*Evilmerodach*, whose proper name was Baltassar, (Dan. 5:1. T.) or the latter was his son. The Jews say that he had been confined in prison, with Joachin, because he had not administered the kingdom well, during the seven years’ illness of his father Nabuchodonosor. Berosus (ap. Jos. c. 1. and Euseb. præp. ix. 40. who cites also Megasthenes) informs us that he reigned with insolence during two years, when he was treacherously murdered by his father-in-law, Neriglissor.  
**28** *Kings*, who had been made captives. Adonibezec had 70. Judg. 1:7. Alexander kept Porus and Taxilus at his court, as Cyrus and done Crœsus, whom he treated with great distinction. The prosperity of Joachin does not seem to have been of long continuance, as his benefactor did not reign above two (v. 27.) or three years. Dan. 8:1.  
**30** *His life*, may be referred to Evilmerodach, unless Joachin was involved in his disgrace, and perished at the same time. Perhaps the king of Juda did not always eat at the table of Evilmerodach, but received his meat from it, as was customary. Syr. &c. C.—He received all that was necessary to support his household, daily. Grotius.—In Jer. 52:34. *until the day of his death*, seems to be an useless “tautology,” which is omitted here, and in “our oldest MS.” says Kennicott; who observes that whoever will compare these passages, “will find many variations, and some corruptions.” But most of them may be easily explained, v. 3. 8. 27. &c. H.
