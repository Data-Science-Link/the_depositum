# 2 Maccabees Commentary

**This** Second Book of Machabees is not a continuation of the history contained in the First; nor does it come down so low as the First does, but relates many of the same facts more at large, and adds other remarkable particulars, omitted in the First Book, relating to the state of the Jews as well before as under the persecution of Antiochus. The author, who is not the same with that of the First Book, has given (as we learn from C. 2:20. &c.) a short abstract of what Jason, of Cyrene, had written in the five volumes, concerning Judas and his brethren. He wrote in Greek, and begins with two letters, sent by the Jews of Jerusalem to their brethren in Egypt. Ch.—Hence the whole book has been considered by some as an epistle. Cotel. Can. Ap. p. 338.—But it is easy to distinguish the letter from the history, ( C.) to which a preface is prefixed. C. 2:20. Yet the Alex. copy has at the end, “A letter concerning the acts of Judas Mach.” H.—The appendix of two epistles was added to the First Book by him who wrote the second, ( W.) abridging the work of Jason. H.

## Chapter 1

**1** *Egypt.* They are invited to worship at Jerusalem. M.—It seems these were most considered; perhaps being more numerous. C.—They had also a schismatical temple. H.  
**7** *Demetrius* Nicator. The date refer to what goes before.—*Nine.* This author dates from autumn, whereas the preceding begins the era of Seleucides, in spring, which accounts for the apparent contradictions. C.—*Tro* *uble.* As they had written when in distress, so they now testify their joy and gratitude to God, begging their brethren to keep the dedication of the new altar. W.—This first letter, sent during the heat of the persecution raised by Epiphanes, is lost.—*Kingdom.* Judea was then tributary to Egypt; yet Jason applied to the Syrian monarch, and instead of waiting for the death of Onias III. wished to purchase his dignity, and to change the manners of the people. Josephus gives contradictory accounts of these affairs, ( C.) if he be really the author of 4 Mac. H.  
**8** *Flour*, (mincha) including corn, &c. After Judas had purified the temple, the usual sacrifices were offered. C.  
**9** *Scenopegia* *;* viz. the *encenia*, or feast of the dedication of the altar, called here *scenopegia*, or feast of the tabernacles, from being celebrated with the like solemnity. Ch. C. 10:6.—The real feast occurs in the month of Tisri. C.  
**10** *Eight.* Thus the preceding letter is dated, according to many, ( M.) as there was no Judas or Aristobolus known at this time. But Judas, the Essene prophet, (C. 2:14. W.) must have flourished about that period; (Jos. Ant. xiii. 19. C.) and one Aristobolus wrote something in the Scripture for Philometor. Clem. Strom. v. Eus. Hist. ii. 17.—After Philadelphus, the kings of Egypt had commonly Jews among their preceptors. Rupert, Vict. x. 15.—This person is supposed to have instructed Physcon. C.  
**11** *King.* Antiochus Sidetes, who began to make war upon the Jews, while Simon was yet alive; (1 Mac. 15:39) and afterwards besieged Jerusalem, under John Hircanus. So that the Judas here mentioned (v. 10.) is not Judas Machabeus, who was dead long before the year 188 of the kingdom of the Greeks, for he died in the year 146 of that epoch; (see above, 1 Mac. c. 2, v. 70, also the note on chap. 1, v. 2.) but either Judas, the eldest son of John Hircanus, or Judas the Essene, renowned for the gift of prophecy, who flourished about that time. Ch.—Epiphanes may as well be meant. The ancestors of those who wrote resisted him.  
**12** *Persia.* This country is not specified in the Rom. and Alex. Sept. Other copies have, “He *God* made them who attacked the holy city flee in swarms to Persia.” Syr. Vat.—the name of Persia now comprised all the dominions of Antiochus; Rupert understands Sidetes. C.  
**13** *Nanea* *.* A Persian goddess, which some have taken for Diana, others for Venus. Ch.—Her temple at Ecbatana was renowned. 1 B. 6:1.  
**14** *Dowry.* Thus the pagans played with religion. M.—Anthony having espoused the Minerva of Athens, required the city to give him 1000 talents for her portion. Dion. Seneca, suasov. 1.—Heliogabalus and Caligula pretended to marry the celestial Venus or the moon. C.  
**16** *Slew.* Lit. “struck.” Gr. “stoned.” Yet Epiphanes escaped. (C. 10:9. and 1 B. 6) having received some wounds. But a fall from his chariot, and vexation, hastened his death. H.—Some of his followers, who had advanced farther into the temple, perished. C.  
**18** **V** **er.** **18** **.** *Scenopegia* *.* The dedication was observed by the people bearing branches, in memory of their late forlorn condition on the mountains. H.—See v. 2.—*Fire.* This feast occurred in Tisri. 2 Esd. 8:1. 14. C.  
**19** *Persia.* Babylonia, called here Persia, from being afterwards a part of the Persian empire. Ch.—Thus S. Chrys. (H. 6. in Mat.) says, the Jews were delivered from “the Persian captivity.” W.—All beyond the Euphrates was now called Persia.—*Valley* of Topheth, where ( C.) it is still shewn. Doubdan.—The miraculous pit was enclosed by Artaxerxes. C. 5:23. H.—Four miracles occurred respecting this fire. v. 20. 22. 32. W.  
**21** *The priest.* Gr. “Nehemias ordered the priests to sprinkle with the water both,” &c. H.—Modern Jews say the sacred fire was not in the second temple. But Gorionides and 4 Mac. admit this fact. C.—Elias obtained fire upon his sacrifice nearly in the same manner. H.  
**23** *Jonathan*, one of the chief priests; perhaps Joiada, Eliasib’s son. C.  
**29** *Spoke* *n*, promising these favours. Deut. 30:3. H.  
**32** *Altar.* This second flame came immediately from heaven, and overpowered that proceeding from the mud. C.  
**34** *A temple.* That is, an enclosure or a wall round about the place where the fire was hid, to separate it from profane uses, to the end that it might be respected as a holy place. Ch.—Such open enclosures are often styled temples. C.—Gr. “But the king enclosing it, made it sacred, (ιερον) having examined the fact.” H.  
**35** *Hand.* The copies vary much. La Haye.  
**36** *Nephthar*, or rather Necphar. Grot.—*Nephi* *.* Greek has the former word. Rom. copy and Syr. Naphtai; may be derived from Chal. *phetir*, “pure, unmixed.” C.—Nephthar may signify “deliverance,” as sacred things are rescued from common use. W.

## Chapter 2

**1** *The descriptions.* That is, the records or memoirs of Jeremias, a work that is now lost. Ch.—It was extant, B.C. 142. C.—S. Ambrose (Of. iii. 14.) writes at large concerning this miracle. W.  
**2** *Of them.* He alludes to his epistle, ( C.) Bar. 6:11. W.  
**4** *And the ark.* These were not taken by the Chaldeans. Jer. 52. M.—Whether they were removed before or after the capture of the city, is disputed. Salien, A. 3446.—Besides the authority of this book, it is most probabe that Jeremias should have preserved them, as he was high in favour. Jer. 39:11. W.—Hence most believe that Nabuzardan granted him leave. C.—Eupolemus says Nabuchodonosor did this after he took the city. Eus. præp. ix. 39.—Others think the prophet removed them under Joakim, having informed only a few of the priests. N. Alex.—*Mountain;* Nebo. Deut. 32:49.  
**7** *Mercy.* Whether the ark, &c. were in the second temple, as this seems to insinuate, has been much debated. The negative seems best established and these promises refer to the Messias, prefigured by the ark. God wished to withdraw the Jews by degrees from their attachment to these sensible things, and to raise their minds to those of a more spiritual nature. S. Amb. Rupert, &c. C. Diss.—Salien ( A. 3609) proves at large, that the ark was discovered at the same time as the sacred fire. M.—Yet Josephus (Bel. vi. 6.) testifies, that nothing was found in the holy of holies when the Romans took it. Hence others think that the ark will be produced to the Jews by Enoch and Elias. Ribera in Agg. i. Tournem.—The first opinion gives most satisfaction. When Christ collected his disciples, he received testimony from the Father and from the Holy Ghost in a bright *cloud.* The figures of the law are at an end, and there will be no need of restoring them at the consummation of all things. H.  
**9** *Treated.* Gr. “He was manifested, and like one possessing wisdom, he,” &c. H.—On this occasion, Solomon chiefly displayed his wisdom, praying aloud.  
**10** *As.* Both dedications lasted eight days, and fire descended. Lev. 9:23 and 2 Par. 7:1.  
**11** *Consumed.* He alludes to what Moses said after the death of Nadab. Lev. 10:16. C.—Fire consumed the sin-offering as well as the rest.  
**13** *Set down.* Gr. “explained.”—*Books.* The Scriptures were not lost. M.—Perhaps before this time no complete collection of them had been made. Esdras would point out and help to discover what had been written. C.—The senate of the nation was also present. Simon Crit. i. 1.—*David:* the psalms. All the other books may be designated under the name of *proph* *ets.* H.—*Kings;* Cyrus, &c. 1 Esd. 6:3. &c. Josephus has inserted many such letters in his work. They were like the title-deeds of the nation. C.—*And.* Gr. “regarding the presents;” αναθεματων. H.  
**14** **4** **.** *Judas.* This seems to be the Essene, who with others wrote this epistle; (C. 1:10. W.) or rather ( H.) the Machabee, who was as solicitous to preserve the sacred books as Antiochus was to destroy them. 1 B. 1:59 and 2:48. It is said that another assembly met to admit such books into the canon as had been written since the days of Nehemias.  
**15** *Things*, collected by Judas. The Bible had been translated into Greek before. But some records might still be wanted by the Jews in Egypt. C.  
**16** *The purification.* This is the feast of the purifying or cleansing of the temple, ( Ch.) the 25th of Casleu. C. 1:9. 18.  
**18** *Place.* They had now liberty to return. What, therefore, can they mean but the coming of the Messias, who was shortly expected? C.—Many Jews at this time were scattered in other countries, and did not chose to return, like those of Egypt. The people of Judea wish all would live together, as they had done under Solomon. H.  
**19** *Place.* Read C. 15:38. After the author had written this appendix to the former book, he resolved to add an epitome of the history. Hence in this preface he informs us of the subject, method, reason, and diligence of his short work. v. 20, 24, 5, 6, 9. W.—This piece is very elegant, and contains several rules for writing history. The author was a Jew as well as Jason. v. 24.  
**22** *Manifestations:* heavenly apparitions. C. 3:25. and 5:2. C.  
**25** *Multitude.* Gr. also, “confusion of numbers, and the difficulty attending those who wish to dive into εισκυκλεισθαν, ( H.) or to include *much* ( C.) historical relations on account of the quantity of matter.” H.  
**27** *No easy task*, &c. The spirit of God, that assists the sacred penman, does not exempt them from labour in seeking out the matter which they are to treat of, and the order and manner in which they are to deliver it. So S. Luke wrote the gospel, *having diligently attained to all things.* Lu. 1:3. Ch.—This evangelist had to inquire of others. W.—Inspiration preserves from all danger of mistake. When something future is *revealed*, there is less difficulty, as God must then dictate the very words. Hence Jeremias wrote with the utmost ease, as Baruch testified. Jer. 36:18. 32. H.—The prophets had, therefore, only to write or speak from the mouth of God. Others were excited by him to treat of history, &c. and were preserved from error, but not from labour. Bellar. Verb. i. 15.—In vain then do our adversaries attempt to prove that this book is not inspired. M.  
**28** *Others.* Gr. “have no easy task, so,” &c. H.—He alludes to the custom of choosing a master of the feast, who had to strive to give general satisfaction. Eccli. 32:1. Est. 1:8. C.  
**29** *Authors.* Gr. “the writer.” H.—Jason resembles an excellent painter, of whose work we desire to give a copy ( C.) in miniature, ( H.) relying entirely on his veracity. Sa.—Yet as the Church esteems this work to be canonical, what is extracted must be true, and inspired, though the writer seems not to have known that he had such a privilege. God might still guide his pen. M.—The original might also be the work of a sacred writer, as many such appear to have been lost. If it were not, what is here selected cannot be questioned. S. Paul quotes some passages even from heathen poets, which in those cases were true, and thus became part of the word of God. H.  
**30** *Master.* Such is Jason. I only paint some parts. C.—*Paint.* Gr. “to burn in and represent to the life, must,” &c. H.—The ancients painted the walls, preparing them by fire, &c. Vitruv. vii. 5. Jos. Ant. xvii. 12. C.  
**32** *Nice.* Gr. εξεργαστικον, “elaborate disquisitions.” Both must equally seek the truth: but long details are not expected in abridgments as they are in a full history. H.  
**33** *Itself.* The account of Alex. should be read next, 1 B. 1. W.

## Chapter 3

**1** *City.* Three things contribute to the well ordering of a state: first, the agreement of the principal men; secondly, the observance of the laws; and thirdly, the eminent virtue of the ruler. While three other things disturb it: first, the obstinacy of transgressors who refuse correction; secondly, their malice, seeking revenge against superiors; and thirdly, the avarice of princes, endeavouring to rob the public treasury. v. 4. W.—*Onias* III. son of Simon II. C. 15:12. C.  
**2** *Place;* city. H.—See the letter of Antiochus the great. Jos. Ant. xii. 3. C.  
**3** *Seleucus*, son of Antiochus the great, and elder brother of Antiochus Epiphanes. Ch.—His sending Heliodorus has tarnished his memory.  
**4** *Overseer* for repairs, which laics might be; (2 Par. 34:8. C.) or Simon was advocate, (Grot.) like the Church defenders, so often mentioned in the councils. C.—*To bring.* Gr. “about disorder in the city.” H.  
**5** *Apollonius*, whom Jonathas defeated. 1 B. 10:69.  
**6** *Store.* He knew that the king provided victims. As Philopator was then in want of money, to pay the tribute imposed by the Romans on his father, he easily persuaded himself that he might seize such a common stock, the state requiring ( C.) that individuals or cities ( H.) should not be too rich.  
**7** *Affairs.* Gr. Rom. Some copies read “effects,” or money. All this is related of Apollonius. 4 Mac. 1.  
**10** *And provisions* is not in Gr. or Syr. C.—Something was to be given for such feasts; (Deut. 14:23. Lyr. M.) or people deposited in the temple their treasures; as all nations have judged that they would be there most secure. Grot. T. C.  
**11** *Tobias*, or rather “son of Joseph and grandson of Tobias.” Jos. Ant. xii. 4.  
**12** *Done.* It was contrary to justice.  
**19** *Shut up.* Hence they were styled *alamoth*, “hidden,” till they were married. Nothing could give a better idea of the distress of the city. C.—These virgins remained in places near the temple, spending their time in prayer, fasting, and works of piety, till they were espoused. 1 K. 2:22. S. Amb. virg. 1. S. Nys. or Nativ. S. Damas iv. 13. W.—There also pious widows dwelt.—*Walls* of the temple, which they were not allowed to pass. M.—The city seemed to be taken by an enemy. C.  
**21** *Expectation.* Gr. “prostration.” H.—It was not unusual to see the Jews fall prostrate on such occasions, to move God or the enemy to pity, v. 15. Judith 4:9. C.  
**24** *Obey.* Gr. “attend.” They designed to plunder, but in vain. H.  
**25** *Horse.* Fiery horses took Elias from the earth, (4 K. 2:11) and the mountain where Eliseus was seemed full of such, (Ib. 6:17) which is not less wonderful than what we read here. See S. Amb. (Of. i. 29.) treating of this history. W.  
**39** *Visiter.* Gr. “epopt,” ( H.) or inspector. C.—So those who had the care of a thing were styled. M.  

---

## Chapter 4

**1** *Evils.* Thus traitors generally calumniate good governors. The best remedy on such occasions is to apply to those in higher power, rather than to the people, who are but too often prone to favour the factious. W.  
**2** *To the.* Gr. “of the affairs, who was the benefactor of the city.” H.  
**3** *Friends.* He had gone to Apollonius.  
**4** *King.* Philopator, ( M.) who knew the real state of the matter.  
**7** *Antiochus* Epiphanes, who usurped the crown. C. 1:11.  
**8** *Sixty.* We find 3660 in 4 Mac. which sum is quite exorbitant.  
**9** *Youth*, under fourteen, to exercise. Vitruv. v. 11.—Men did the like naked in the gymnasium, as women did apart at Lacedemon. Jason wished to make his countrymen adopt the pagan customs, which tended to corrupt their morals. v. 12. C.—Antiochians, to please the vanity of Antiochus, (Serar.) or that they might enjoy the like privileges. Salien. M.  
**10** *Rule*, as high priest. v. 21 and 50.  
**11** *Alliance*, afterwards under Judas. 1 B. 8:17. C.—John had procured real advantages for the city. M.  
**12** *Houses.* Gr. “he led them under the cap;” *petasus*, sacred to Mercury, or rather to Bacchus, and the emblem of liberty. C.  
**13** **3** **.** *Now.* Gr. “Thus it was the height of hellenism, and the increase of foreign customs through,” &c.—*No priest.* He did not deserve the title, though he was really a descendant of Aaron. Gr. “not high priest.” H.  
**14** *Temple.* Where true religion is abolished, most people follow none; but rather apply themselves to vanity and worse sins. W.—*Allowance.* They contributed money, (Grot.) or rather strove to obtain the prize. C.—*Discus:* “a round stone, with a hole in the middle.” Prot. marg. H.—People threw it as high or as far as they could, having one foot up and the other under something resembling a pine-apple. This game was very ancient. Odys. θ. Metam. x.—Gr. “after the invitation of the discus:” the prize was placed in the midst to excite emulation.  
**15** *Glories;* the honour of being gymnasiarch, or agonothete. C.—They sought after *corruptible crowns*, while many pay no regard to heaven. 1 Cor. 9:25. H.  
**16** *Dangerous.* Gr. “misery, and those whose institutes they zealously adopted, and whom in all they wished to resemble, the same they found their enemies and chastisers.” H.—God thus punished ( C.) their perfidy. H.  
**18** *Fifth;* perhaps in imitation of the Olympic games, ( M.) first instituted at Elea, and afterwards at Alexandria, Athens, &c. Grot. C.  
**19** *Sinful.* Gr. “spectators, being Antiochians, to carry 300 drachmas. H.—*Didrachmas*, or double drachmas of Alexandria, which amount only to one Roman. Hence Greek interpreters generally express thus the half sicle.—*Silver*, or money; ( C.) gold. M.—Thus the value would be fourteen times greater. C.—In a MS. of Arundel, 3300 occurs, (Usher.) as well as in the Syr. C.—*Necessary.* Lit. and Gr. “proper.” Grabe supplies this as far as *but*, v. 20. H.  
**20** *Galleys*, or adorning them for the sports. The deputies were ashamed to comply with Jason’s order; or they judged this use of the money more agreeable to the king. C.—Go to 1 B. 1:17. W.  
**21** *Treat.* Gr. “when king Ptolemy Philometor ascended the throne;” πρωτοκλισια. H.—Grotius would substitute πρωτοκουρια, “the first hair cutting,” which was a great festival, the hair being presented to some deity. Apollonius was sent under the pretence of honouring Philometor, but in reality to sound the dispositions of the nobility respecting the claims of Epiphanes to be the king’s tutor. Cleopatra died this year, A. 3831. The regents of Egypt demanded Celosyria, her portion, and war commenced. C.—Epiphanes pretended to defend Philometor against his younger brother, (Livy xliv.) but he wished to seize the kingdom. 1 B. 1:17. W.  
**22** *Lights*, usual in testimony of joy. C.—The roofs at Athens were all illuminated when Anthony entered; (Plut.) and Cæsar ascended the capitol, while forty elephants on each side bore torches. Sueton. xxxvii.  
**23** *Bro* *ther*, and of course a Benjamite, so that the usurpation was doubly criminal. T.—But S. Tho. Petau, &c. suppose that he resembled Simon in guilt, or was his brother-in-law. Josephus informs us that Menelaus was brother of Onias and of Jason; though his authority is not great, as he contradicts himself, (Ant. xii. 6. and xv. see C. 1:7. C.) though not in this point. H.—By the law, those of the tribe of Benjamin could not be priests. Thus the succession was broken and restored in Mathathias. 1 B. 2. W.  
**29** *Succeeding* to the high priesthood, (Gr. H.) after the death of Menalaus. Jos.—Yet some think he was only his “vicar,” διαδοχον, (Grot. Usher) and he seems never to have been recognised. C.—*Was.* Gr. “*left* Crates, who was over the Cyprians,” to act for him, while he sent to arraign Menelaus, or to testify that he had demanded the money in vain. H.  
**30** Mallos, in Cilicia. The Greek cities were more delicate in this respect than those of Persia, which were frequently given to the king’s wives or friends.  
**32** *Temple.* He was no longer there, but Lysimachus complied with his orders, ( C.) v. 39 or Menelaus had taken the vessels with him. H.  
**33** *Daphne.* This was a famous asylum, to which Onias retreated without worshipping Apollo. He had gone to Antioch to answer the calumnies of Simon; and though Jason got his place, ( C.) the king could not help respecting him, ( H.) and wept at his death. This it the highest praise of Onias, as even such a monster acknowledged his merit. C.—Cæsar wept when the head of Pompey was shewn to him. V. Max. i. 5.  
**35** *Man.* The people, ( W.) and even the king, admired his solid piety. Thus ( H.) the Tyrians buried the innocent. v. 49. W.  
**40** *Tyrannus.* One of this name occurs Acts 19:9. Gr. “Auransu,” ( H.) or one from Auran, near Damascus.  
**41** *Ashes.* Gr. adds, “lying there,” ( H.) in the temple, near the altar, or in the place assigned for them. Lev. 1:16. C.  
**45** *Ptolemee*, the son of Dorymenus, a favourite of the king, ( Ch.) whose perfidy had procured him the government of Celosyria. C. 10:3. and 1 B. 3:38.  
**46** *Court.* Gr. “peristyle,” or gallery supported by pillars. C.

## Chapter 5

**1** *Second.* After he had sent Apollonius, he proceeded no farther then Joppe and Jerusalem; being perhaps afraid of the Romans. C. 4:21. Three years after, as the regents of Egypt demanded Celosyria, he went to meet them in their own country. A. 3834.  
**2** *Days.* These things were not seen only by people inclined to superstition, or for a short time. There must be true prodigies, as so many false ones have been published. Josephus records what happened before the last siege of Jerusalem, de Bel. vii. 12. C.—Miraculous visions foreshew the wrath of God against sinners, and admonish all to repent, as the emperor Charlemagne interpreted the appearance of a great comet. Fascic. rerum. W.—Yet such things are sometimes only natural effects, which the ignorant misapply. This was not here the case. H.  
**5** *Dead.* This rumour caused much evil to the Jews. Antiochus was informed that they had rejoiced at the news, and therefore fell upon the city.  
**6** *Evil*, as the numbers are thus lessened. Thus Tacitus, speaking of the civil wars between Otho and Vitellius, says, *detestanda vota, inter duos quorum bello solum id scires deteriorem fore qui vicisset* *.*  
**8** *Shut up* in prison, out of which he escaped to Egypt; ( M.) or he was hard pressed, ( C.) or accused. Grot.  
**9** *Lacedemon* *.* Lit. “the Lacedemonians,” ( H.) who served in the army of Philometor. Grot.—It is certain that this nation was then part of the Achean league, in alliance with Egypt. Polyb. C.—*Kindred.* The Spartans sprung from Abraham. 1 B. 12:2. ( W.) 21. C.  
**10** *Burial.* Such as was not refused to strangers. The thirty pieces of silver purchased ground for that purpose. Mat. 27:7. C.  
**11** *Alliance* with him, or refuse to submit. H.—The enterprise of Jason, and the account of their rejoicing, made him form this judgment.—*Arms.* Josephus (B. i. 1. and vi. p. 929) says the Jews came to meet him, and that he besieged and took the city. But (Ant. xii. 7.) he asserts that his partisans opened the gates without fighting. How shall we reconcile these things!  
**14** *Slain*, or sold, the latter amounting to one-half of the 80,000.  
**19** *Place.* Temples and victims are for our own advantage. Is. 1:11. Jer. 6:20 and 3 K. 8:27. God has often suffered sacred places to be profaned, when piety had been disregarded. C.—All religious rites are designed for God’s glory and men’s welfare; and hence, when they cease to serve God, they holy things are destroyed or taken away. W.  
**21** *Foot.* These are hyperbolical expressions, denoting the extravagance of Epiphanes after victory. Thus Xerxes made a bridge to join Asia and Europe together; and Caligula made one on the Lucrine lake, that he might have the pleasure of riding upon it. Just. 2. Sueton.—Epiphanes had met with little resistance, so that he had no reason to boast.  
**23** *Garizim*, or the country of Samaria, over which Andronicus alone was governor.—*Who bore.* Gr. and Syr. read in the singular, as this regards Menelaus.  
**24** *He.* Syr. “Epiphanes.”—*Hateful.* Gr. μυσαρχην, ( H.) “prince of Mysia,” (Grot.) or of sinners. H.  
**26** *To see*, or celebrate the festival. 1 Mac. 1:30. &c. C.  
**27** *Was the tenth.* That is, he had nine others in his company. Ch.—He was the tenth lawful pontiff, under the Greeks. W.—Judas is specified, because he was the most renowned. His father and five sons, joined by four others retired into desert places, and eat what they could find. C.—These ten dwelt in the mountains. Salien.—They were conducted to battle by Judas, ( H.) the Decurio. M.

## Chapter 6

**1** *After*, A. 3837.—*Old*, or senator. Gr. “Atheneus,” or “an Athenian senator.”  
**2** *Olympius.* They thought this idol agreed best with the idea of the God of heaven, changing the names of the deities, where they had dominion. Other nations made no resistance: but the Jews knew better. C.—*Garizim;* viz. the temple of the Samaritans. And as they were originally strangers, the name of *Hospitalis* (which signifies *of* or *belonging to strangers*) was applicable to the idol set up in their temple. Ch.—The Samaritans in time of danger, denied that they had anything to do with the Jews, pretending to be of Sidonian extraction. They even requested that their temple might be dedicated to the Greek Jupiter. Jos. Ant. xii. 7.—Yet Epiphanes chose “the Hospitaller.” C.—Sannaballat procured this temple to be erected in the days of Alexander; and Ananias built another in Egypt, under Philometor. Both were schismatical. Jos. Ant. xi. 8. and xv. 6. W.  
**4** *Lewd.* Priests on duty were not even allowed to approach to their wives, and the most pure women had no right to go into the interior of the temple. C.—*And.* Gr. “in the courts, and also bringing in improper things.” H.  
**6** *Je* *w.* None did this except he were legally questioned. It would have unnecessarily brought on a persecution. H.—The very name was become criminal, as that of Christian was afterwards. C.  
**7** *Sacrific* *es.* Gr. “each month, to the sacrifice (and feast) of entrails,” ( H.) which were given back to him who presented the victim. Grot.—The eastern kings celebrated their birth-days; Epiphanes did it every month. 1 B. 1:61. Mat. 14:6.—*About.* Gr. “to follow the march;” πομπευειν. C.—Prot. “to go in procession to Bacchus, carrying ivy.” Ward (Err. p. 114) reads πομπαδυειν, and refers the reader to the lexicon to see if there be anything in it like the Catholic processions, or whether it signify so much as “to go about,” as other Prot. Bibles translate it. These interpreters frequently use Catholic terms, where they might render them odious. Id. H.  
**8** *Ptolemeans*, who resided at Ptolemais. C.—Most Gr. copies have Ptolemee. C. 4:45. H.—We find that many of the neighbouring nations invaded the Jews, but were repressed by Judas. 1 B. 5:15.  
**10** *Women.* See 1 Mac. 1:64. &c. C.—Besides the former massacres, (C. 5) four great martyrdoms are here recorded: first, of two women, with the children; second, of others keeping the sabbath; third, of Eleazar, ninety years old; and fourthly, of the seven brethren, with their mother. C. 7. W.  
**11** *Philip*, the governor of Jerusalem. Ch.—C. 5:22. H.—See 1 B. 2:31. C.  
**12** *Now.* A necessary caution for the weak in times of persecution. W.—See C. 7:32. Judith 8:22 and 1 B. 2:52.  
**13** *Punished*, lest they should become incorrigible. When God neglects to do this, his anger is most terrible. Ezec. 16:42. C.  
**14** *Sins.* God seems at present to take no notice of the crimes of the Gentiles, or he exterminates them at once, as he did the Chanaanites, Sodom, &c. But the Jews he corrects for their amendment and trial. The sages of paganism never inculcated such excellent maxims.  
**18** *Scribes;* a priest. S. Amb.—He suffered at Antioch, before the king. C. 7:1. Joseph. l. 2.—The Fathers highly extol his fortitude and virtue, styling him the *father* of the seven brothers, and the protomartyr of the old law. C.—Yet we find others unnamed suffering before him. v. 10. H.—Eleazar was learned in the Scriptures, and in all divine and human knowledge. W.  
**19** *Hateful.* Gr. “criminal life, and went first of his own accord to be bastinaded;” τυμπανιζεσθαι. H.—S. Paul probably alluded to this torment, Heb. 11:35. It was used among the Jews. C. Diss.  
**20** *Life.* He would not eat swine’s flesh to save it. Gr. “But spitting it out, (as those ought to come forward who expect to be tortured; or avenged. αμυνεσθαι) of which things it is not lawful to taste through love of life.” H.  
**21** *Wicked pity.* Their pity was *wicked*, in as much as it suggested that wicked proposal of saving his life by dissimulation. Ch.—To feign or make outward shew of consenting to a false religion, is never lawful. W.—Gr. “They were set over that wicked feast *or* sacrifice,” σπλαγχνισμω, ( H.) in which the entrails were eaten. C.—In this sense the term is used v. 7 and 8 by the Vulg. Here *Pity* is preferred, as the man seemed to be actuated by it. H.—This generous martyr would not scandalize the weak, by doing a thing in itself lawful, which would have been deemed a prevarication. He was guided by those excellent maxims which Christ, S. Paul, and S. Saba (Mart. Ap. xii.) have inculcated and practised. Mat. 18:7. Rom. 14:14 and 1 Cor. 8:4. 10. C.  
**23** *The other.* Lit. “hell,” or the grave. H.—Under the old law the saints could not enter heaven, but at their departure were detained in limbo. W.—Some holy doctors have declared that they would rather go to hell than commit a sin. S. Ans.—They understand by hell the torments of that place, but not the opposition to God’s will, which is found in the damned, and constitutes one of the greatest of their pains. H.  
**24** *Age.* “Old age ought to be the haven, not the shipwreck, of a former life.” S. Amb. de Jacob. W.  
**26** *Dead.* Nothing could be more express for the torments after death. As the time of the Messias drew near, these truths were more developed. C. 7:9. Wisd. 5:16. Ps. 1:6. C. Grot. Mat. 12:32.  
**30** *Pains.* Some of the martyrs seem not to have felt their torments. God made them suffer no more than they could bear. H.

## Chapter 7

**1** *Scourges*, made of leather thongs; *taureis* *.* H.—These brethren are styled Machabees; as Judas rendered this name so famous, that all who suffered or fought valiantly for religion in those times, went by this appellation. Josephus has much embellished this history, and Erasmus still more. The tombs of these martyrs were shewn at Antioch. C.—Their names are not known. H.—Those who wish to see more, may consult the large discourse of Josephus on the Machabees, ( W.) though this work be contested, and S. Cyp. iv. ep. 6. S. Amb. i. of. 40. S. Chrys. Aug. Leo, &c. W.  
**6** *Pleas* *ure.* Lit. “be comforted,” as the Sept. translate, ( H.) Deut. 32:36. It may imply that God will avenge or chastise his servants, and then restore them to favour. This latter sense is here adopted. v. 35.  
**8** *Language.* The Jews have always been very attentive to their own language, though they be forced to learn others for the sake of commerce, and to hold conversation with those among whom they live. This young man, no doubt, understood Greek, in which language his brother had probably spoken. The mother addressed her children in the Hebrew or Syriac tongue. v. 21. 27. C.  
**9** *Most wicke* *d.* The martyrs have sometimes been inspired by God to speak in harsh language to magistrates; though their office generally commands respect. H.—*Life.* The resurrection is clearly specified in all these answers. The Redeemer was near at hand. C.—*Christiani fuerunt … factis* *.* S. Aug. ser. i. 2.  
**16** *Power.* Nothing could be more free than this answer, which greatly resembles that of Christ. John 19:11. C.  
**20** *Seven.* the last was not yet dead: but he was before this was written, so that the mother’s praise was perfect. H.  
**22** *Womb.* This has always astonished the learned, the infant being formed often against the woman’s desire. Job 10:10. Wisd. 7:2. S. Aug. anima i. 15. C.  
**24** *Despising.* Lit. “despising the voice of the insulter.” Gr. “fearing or perceiving that the speech was reproachful.” H.—Syr. “turned aside not to hear the reproaches,” &c. He did not understand Hebrew; but perceiving the constancy of the young men, he thought that their mother exhorted them to refuse compliance. C.—*Happy.* This is beyond the power of riches or of any king. H.  
**26** *Promised.* A promise regards something good; so that if a person should even bind himself by an oath to do evil, he must refrain, as to comply would he another sin. W.—This woman *promised* to *counsel*, but not as the king wished, ( H.) to gain a prolongation of life and worldly honours for her son. M.—Such an equivocation was lawful. W.—The king might blame himself if he was deceived. H.  
**27** *Three years.* So long physicians judged it best for children to suck, till they could take solid meat. Vales. lxxxiii. Gen. 21:8. C.—“Chrysippus assigns three years for the nurse.” Quint. i. 1.  
**28** *Nothing*, not out of pre-existent and eternal matter. S. Aug. Nat. boni xxvi. Rom. 4:17.—So God can reduce all to nothing. C. 8:18.  
**29** *Mercy*, in eternity of bliss. v. 23. Syr. C.  
**36** *Life.* Gr. “short labour of eternal life, are fallen under the covenant of God.” H.—They enjoy that life which God promised.  
**37** *God.* This was accomplished, v. 17. C. 9:15.  
**38** *Cease.* The persecution was severe, but short. Judas the next year ( A. 3838. C.) began to liberate the nation, ( H.) by God’s mercy. C. 8:5, 27.  
**40** *Undefiled*, by idolatry. We read 4 Mac. that he threw himself into a boiling cauldron; ( C.) and Josephus says his mother “jumped into the fire that she might not be touched by any.” But this is uncertain. The Church honours S. Apollonia, who acted thus; (Feb. ix.) it is supposed by divine inspiration. H.  
**41** *Consumed.* Gr. “died” ( H.) of joy: (Sixth. Bib. v. Victoria) she place herself amid the dead bodies, and begged of God to release her soul; which was granted. Arab. Gorion.—But most believe that she suffered martyrdom immediately after her children. Jos. &c.—The Church honoured these martyrs from the earliest ages, and before any other of the Old Testament. We may justly style them the martyrs of the resurrection, as none at that time had spoken of it so distinctly. SS. Naz. Max. of Turin, Gaudentius, &c. have pronounced panegyrics upon them.  
**42** *Sacrifices.* Gr. σπλαγχνισμους. C. 6:21. H.—Read 1 B. 2:1 where the wars begun by Mathathias, and persecuted by Judas, are recorded. W.  

---

## Chapter 8

**1** *Towns.* Lit. “castles.” Gr. “villages.” It also means a town or village; and at this time, Judas chiefly dwelt in the deserts. H.—Many particulars of this war are found 1 B. 3.  
**2** *Lord.* Prayer is particularly requisite before battle. W.  
**3** *Blood* of the Jews justly slain. M.—The voice of Abel’s and of Christ’s blood is very different. Gen. 4:10. Heb. 12:24.  
**8** *Philip seeing*, &c. The governor of Jerusalem found himself unable to contend with Judas, especially after the victories he had obtained over Apollonius and Seron. 1 Mac. 3. Ch.—He was left two years before ( C.) to afflict the Jews. W.  
**9** *Twenty thousand.* The whole number of the forces sent at that time into Judea, was 40,000 footmen and 7,000 horsemen; (1 Mac. 3:30) but only 20,000 are here taken notice of, because there were no more with Nicanor at that time of the battle. Ch.  
**10** *Talents.* So much the king was in arrear, owing to his prodigality. For which reason he was gone beyond the Euphrates to raise money. His father had to pay the Romans 15,000 talents in twelve years.  
**11** *Ninety.* Often ( C.) a talent was paid for one slave. Jos. Ant. xii. 4.  
**13** *Justice.* Gr. δικην, “vengeance” ( H.) against the enemies. C.  
**15** *Covenant.* A just and religious cause is the best help in war. W.  
**16** *Seven thousand.* In the Greek it is *six thousand.* But then three thousand of them had no arms. 1 Mac. 4:6. Ch.—If the army was divided into four companies of 1,500, there would be only 6,000. But if Judas had with him 3,000, it would consist of 7,500. C.—*Reconciled.* Gr. “consternated at,” &c. H.  
**20** *Galatians.* That is, the Gauls, who having ravaged Italy and Greece, poured themselves in upon Asia in immense multitudes, where also they founded the kingdom of Galatia, or Gallo—Græcia. Ch.—This battle is no where else recorded in Scripture. But it seems to allude to the aid given to Soter by the Jews, ( W.) when he repulsed the Galatians. Appian.—Antiochus the great rewarded them for their valour shewn in behalf of his father. Joseph. xii. 3. W.—*Six.* Gr. “8,000.”—*When.* Gr. “with 4,000 Macedonians; when the Macedonians being at a stand, the 6,000 (Grabe substitutes 8,000) slew twelve myriads,” &c. H.—Historians have not specified this irruption, as it had no farther consequences. The Galatians were very powerful under Antiochus the great, and sided with him. The consul, Manlius, made them promise to keep within their own territories. But they did not observe this agreement, since they attacked Eumenes while Epiphanes persecuted the Jews. It is not agreed when they made the invasion of Babylonia, then defended by Jewish and Macedonian troops under the king of Syria.  
**22** *Joseph;* perhaps the same with John Gaddis, or simply a relation.  
**23** *Es* *dras.* Gr. and Syr. “Eleazar;” probably the brother of Judas. Grotius thinks that the latter read the account of the death of Eleazar, which must be understood of the martyr, (C. 5) as the brother of Judas was slain under Eupator. Perhaps the law regarding people going to fight was read; (Deut. 20:6 and 1 B. 3:56) or as Judas prepared for battle by prayer and fasting, some portions of Scripture might be selected while they were at Maspha.—*Help.* So he specifies *the victory of God.* C. 13:15. C.  
**24** *Above nine thousand*, viz. including the three thousand slain in the pursuit. Ch.—Three thousand fell on the field of battle. 1 B. 4:15.  
**26** *Time.* They wished to be in the camp before the sabbath, having designed to collect the *spoils.*  
**28** *Widows.* Judas follows the spirit rather than the letter of the law. Num. 31:27. Deut. 14:29.  
**30** *Timotheus* *.* C. 10:24. The particulars of this war are not given. It seems to have taken place after the temple was purified. v. 31. We must distinguish this first war from another mentioned. C. 10:24. and 1 B. 5:5. Judas defeated another Timotheus beyond the Jordan. C. 12:10. and 1 Mac. 5:11. 34. 37.  
**31** *Jerusalem.* They had taken all but he citadel. C. 10:1.  
**35** *Apparel*, as a general. C.—*Fleeing.* Gr. “like a fugitive, having rendered himself destitute, he came through the midland country to Antioch above all being fortunate himself in,” &c. H.—He was too happy in having escaped. The Rom. ed. and Syr. agree with us, “being very unhappy,” &c. ( C.) which is substituted by Grabe. H.

## Chapter 9

**1** *At.* Read 1 B. 4:28. W.—*Time*, A. 3840. The motives and ill success of this journey are given 1 B. 3:31 and 6:1. C.  
**2** *Persepolis;* otherwise called Elymais, ( Ch.) a chief ( W.) “city of Persia.” Hence Elymais may be called *Persepolis.* H.—The famous city of this name, where Cyrus had built a palace to the astonishment of the world, had been ( C.) burnt by Alexander when intoxicated, and urged on by a harlot. Curt. v. 15.—Noble ruins still remain on the Araxes.  
**3** *Ecbatana*, capital of Media. C.—See C. 1:16. H.  
**4** *Forward.* He felt a violent fit of the cholic.  
**8** *Man.* He seems to have claimed divine honours, v. 12. C. 5:21. and 9:8. Dan. 11:36. Arab. C.  
**13** *Not like.* Because his repentance was not for the offence committed against God, but barely on account of his present sufferings. Ch.—For these he really grieved. 1 B. 6:11. Yet was not sorry for the offence against God and men. So the damned acknowledge that their punishments are inflicted on account of their sins, yet have not true repentance. W.—In like manner Esau repented for the loss of his birthright. Heb. 12:17. M.—Epiphanes had abandoned God, who now laughs at him, (Prov. 1:26) as some of the Machabees had threatened. C. 7:14. 7. 9. 31. 2. 5. 6. He is the model of false penitents, who are actuated by servile fear.  
**14** *Free* and independent, ( C.) like Antioch. Pliny v. 21.  
**15** **Ve** **r.** **15** **.** *Athenians.* This seems to have been put for Antiochians, C. 4:9. in Greek; which name would suit better here, as Epiphanes had no power over Athens. Grot. C.—Yet it was highly privileged ( H.) above all the cities of Greece. M.—Jason had obtained for the citizens of Jerusalem to be called Antiochians. C. 6:1. But this grant had been revoked, or not carried into effect since the late troubles. C.—Here the privilege is to be extended to all the *Jews.* H.—Ptolemais and Calliroe enjoyed the same. Harduin.  
**16** *Sacrifices*, as Darius, Philometor, and afterwards (1 B. 10:39.) Nicator did. 1 Esd. 6:9. C.  
**19** **. Subjects.** Lit. “citizens.” H.—Similar addresses (v. 20.) were sent by the emperors to the Romans; and by Cæsar and Anthony to their allies. Jos. Ant. xiv. 17. and 22. Tull. Epist.  
**23** *Father:* Antiochus the great. The Persian monarchs generally took this precaution.—*Countries.* So profane authors style the provinces beyond the Euphrates. Diodorus, S. Jerom (in Dan. 11.) and others, inform us that Antiochus attempted to plunder the temple of Belus, at Elymais, and took off a vast sum of money under pretext of paying the tribute to the Romans. But the neighbouring nations fell upon him, and cut him with his army to pieces. Philopator succeeded to the throne.  
**25** *Antiochus* Eupator, nine years old.—*Below.* This is lost.  
**26** *Favours.* He must have been deranged. C.  
**28** *Mountains*, at Tabes, (Polyb.) in Patacene. Curt. v.—Historians relate that he lost his senses, (daimonesas) being terrified by a demon, on account of his criminal attempt against the temple of Diana. Polyb. excerp. Vales. S. Jer.—This was a real crime in him, as he took the idol for a deity. But his conduct towards the temple and nation of the Jews would probably weigh heavier upon his conscience. C.—S. Cyprian (exhort.) styles him “an inveterate enemy to all good; nay, in Antiochus antichrist is expressed.” W.  
**29** *That was.* Syr. “son of his nurse,” appointed regent.—*Philometo* *r* Lysias asserted his title to the regency, and had the young king, so that Philip applied to the Egyptians to help in the execution of the last will of the deceased. C.—Read 1 B. 6:17. W.

## Chapter 10

**1** *City.* He had done both before the death of Epiphanes, ( C.) after the fourth battle against Lysias. 1 B. 4. W.—The author has given the journey and death of Antiochus together, and now returns to his subject.  
**2** *Altars.* Such were erected before the houses. 1 B. 1:50. Jer. 11:13.  
**3** *Stones;* “heated,” (Gr. Syr. Serar.) or by miracle, (Arab. Gorion. T.) or striking fire with a flint upon tinder. In this manner the Church still renews fire on Holy Saturday. The Jews could not use profane fire in the temple. Lev. 10:1. God restored the sacred fire by miracle. C. 1:18. &c. Pagans have had many superstitious customs with regard to fire. C.  
**6** *Manner*, with the like ceremonies and solemnity. C.—*Green branches* might be procured in November and December, as those months in Palestine are as fine as our spring. Roger.  
**7** *Green.* Gr. “beautiful;” probably the orange tree. Lev. 23:40. See diss. on mandrakes. C. H.  
**8** *Days.* Beza allows that Christ complied. Jo. 10. It is wonderful then that Prot. should reject this book.  
**9** **Ve** **r.** **9** **.** *Illustrious.* Go to 1 B. 5:1. W.  
**11** *Appointed.* So Lysias gave out. C. 9:29. He had been governor before the journey of Epiphanes. 1 B. 3:32.  
**12** *Macer*, “lean.” Gr. makros, “tall.” See C. 4:45. and 8:8. Polybius styles him “a prudent and active man.” C.  
**13** *Revolted.* So they interpreted ( H.) his disapprobation of the cruelties exercised upon the Jews. C.—Gr. “had not yet any honourable place of power entrusted to him, being dispirited, he,” &c. H.—It is never a proof of fortitude, but of pusillanimity, to kill oneself to get rid of temporal misery. But it is very heroical to die willingly for God’s glory.  
**14** *Gorgias*, who had been defeated. 1 B. 4. W.—He was an experienced captain in Idumea, and the country south of Carmel. C.—*Fought.* Gr. “prolonged the war.” Grot.  
**15** *The Jews*, &c. He speaks of them that had fallen from their religion, and were enemies of their country, who joining with the Idumeans or Edomites, kept possession of the strong holds, and from thence annoyed their countrymen. Ch.—Gr. and Syr. “Idumeans,” who appear in the sequel.  
**18** *Some;* probably the sons of Bean. 1 B. 5:4.  
**23** *Holds;* strong places, defended with towers. Some Judas burnt. C.  
**24** *Timotheus*, who had been defeated (1 B. 8:30. W.) soon after Nicanor.  
**26** *Altar*, between it and the porch. Joel 2:17.—*Law.* Ex. 23:22. Lev. 26:7. Deut. 7:15. C.  
**32** *G* *azara*, different from Gaza, which is so called elsewhere. M.—This Gazara was a fortress against the inroads of the Idumeans.—*Chereas*, brother of Timotheus. C.  
**35** *Men.* Gorionides (3:13) says they were Assideans, mentioned before 1 B. 2:42 and 7:13. W.—*Got.* Gr. “slew every one they met.” H.  
**36** *After.* Gr. “by a back way ( H. undefended, περισπασμω. Grot.) to those within, burnt the towers, and kindling fires burnt the blasphemers alive. But these cut down the gates; and giving entrance to the rest of the army, took the city and killed Timotheus, who had hidden in a hole,” ( H.) or cistern; λακκω. C.—Vulg. had perhaps *lacu* *.* Sa. M.

## Chapter 11

**1** *Cousin.* He was of the blood royal and governor, (v. 22 and 1 B. 11:18) having supplanted Philip. C.—Lysias had been vanquished already. 1 B. 4:28. W. C.  
**3** *Temple*, as of a farm, by selling offices and requiring money of those who offered victims. 1 B. 10:42. C.  
**5** *Narrow.* Gr. “secure.” Prot. “strong town.”—*Furlongs.* Gr. “schœnus,” ( H.) 625 paces. Yet Eusebius and S. Jerom say it was twenty miles distant, towards Hebron, (Jos. 15:58) which seems more accurate. C.—Some figure may easily have been changed. H.  
**6** *Angel.* Knowing that the patriarchs and Moses had often received such aid, the Machabees prayed that their good cause might be espoused by the angels; and their request was granted, though they were forced to co-operate. Sometimes God gave victory without the interference of men. Ex. 14 and 4 K. 19. W.  
**8** *Horseman*, in appearance, but really ( H.) an angel, as five came before. C. 10:29.  
**17** *Delivering;* (Syr.) but Gr. has, “seeing the oracle subscribed, (or underwritten) made a petition concerning the things declared in it.” H.—Kings’ decrees were often styled oracles; and this might contain leave for Lysias to treat with the Jews, (Grot.) or the last injunction of Epiphanes, (C. 9:19) or the resolution of Judas. C.  
**21** *In the year one hundred and forty-eight;* viz. according to the computation of the Greeks, which was different from that of the Hebrews, followed by the writer of the first book of Machabees. However by this date, as well as by other circumstances, it appears that the expedition of Lysias, mentioned in this chapter, is different from that recorded 1 Mac. 6:16. Ch.—*Dioscorus* *.* Syr. “the last of Tisri.” Gr. “Jupiter of Corinth,” which is more unintelligible. There was no month called Dioscorus among the Greeks. C.—It might be put for Dius, (Grot.) or Distrus, (Serar. T.) or it was an intercalary month, between March and April, (Salien) or the Macedonians had two names for some months. H.  
**22** *Bro* *ther.* So he is styled for honour. v. 35. M.  
**23** *Gods.* This impious custom began in the East, and was abolished by Christianity. C.—Epiphanes had affected to be a god, but at last saw his folly. C. 9. H.  
**25** *Restored.* It was already occupied by the Jews, but they were much disturbed by the garrison. Now their rights are admitted.  
**27** *Senate.* The constitution was aristocratical.  
**29** *Menelaus.* He was at Antioch, and was reputed high priest, being established by the king. But the Jews would not receive him, having chosen Judas. C.  
**30** *Day*, or for fifteen days. v. 33. M.  
**31** **Ve** **r.** **31** **.** *Ignorance.* He excuses them, and grants an amnesty. 1 B. 13:39. C.  
**34** *Romans.* Others were sent soon after to burn the ships and maim the elephants, which Eupator had more than had been agreed upon. Usher, A. 3841.—They undertake to promote the welfare of their allies. Yet the peace was of short duration, and perhaps never ratified.

## Chapter 12

**2** *Timotheus* *and* *Apolloinus* *.* Others of the same name were slain before. C. 10:37. and 1 B. 3:11. W. C.  
**8** *Designed.* The heart is the source of sin, and God thus punished the intentions of the Jamnites. H.  
**9** *Off*, or ten leagues. Jerusalem was on elevated ground. C.—A furlong is about the eighth of a mile, (others say the fifth, or a thousand feet) so that the fire was seen at the distance of thirty or forty-eight miles. W.  
**11** *Rest.* Gr. “the Nomades,” ( H.) who dwelt in tents, and lived on plunder, (Strabo xvi.) like Ismael. Gen. 16:12.  
**13** *Casphin* *;* Chasbon, or Hesebon. 1 B. 5:26. Num. 21:25. It was famous for its waters.  
**14** *Spoken.* The enemy generally reviled the Jews.  
**15** *World.* Thus setting a pattern to virtuous generals.  
**17** *Charac* *a*, or Carcar. Judg. 8:10 and 11:3. C.—Tubianites, “religiously good;” probably the Assideans, (1 B. 2:42. W.) or inhabitants of Tob. H.  
**18** *Things.* The Jews had retired to Characa or Dathema, so that he ravaged the country and left garrisons, which were cut in pieces. Judas soon after with 6000 routed Timotheus, though he had 122,500 men. 1 B. 5:8. 37, 43.  
**21** *Carnion*, or Asteroth Carnaim.  
**24** *Deceived.* Gr. “if they slew him, would not be regarded,” ( H.) but slain without mercy. C.  
**26** *Carnion* *.* Gr. adds, “and the temple of Astergata,” ( H.) the idol Astarte, or Derceto of the Philistines.  
**29** *Scythopolis.* Formerly called *Bethsan*, ( Ch.) near the lake of Tiberias.  
**31** *Weeks* of Pentecost, celebrated seven weeks after the Passover. Lev. 23:15. C.  
**32** *Gorgias*, who had been twice defeated. C. 10:14. and 1 B. 4:1. W.—Idumea*.* Grotius would read Jamnia. But he might govern the southern parts of Juda, ( C.) then occupied by the Idumeans. H.  
**35** *Maresa.* Syr. “Samaria,” as the Vulg. has. 1 B. 5:66.  
**38** *Place.* Probably without the walls. Num. 19:2. 17 and 31:19.  
**39** *Following*, on Saturday evening, or on Sunday.—*Fathers*, with those of the same nation.  
**40** *Of the donaries*, &c. That is, of the votive offerings, which had been hung up in the temples of the idols, which they had taken away when they burnt the port of Jamnia, (v. 9.) contrary to the prohibition of the law. Deut. 7:25. Ch.—All such things should have been destroyed, (Jos. 7 and 1 K. 15. W.) or melted down. Perhaps the soldiers intended to bring them to Judas. He excused them charitably, and hoped that their temporal chastisement might have served to expiate their fault.  
**42** *Forgotten.* Syr. “imperfect.” Gr. “effaced.” C.—Some copies, “that they might not, on account of the sin committed, be entirely blotted out.” Ald. Usher.—They were convinced that some sins might be forgiven in the other world, particularly when the living interceded. C.—The Jews began to pray for the dead after the captivity, (Grot.) when the prophets had more clearly explained what took place after death. C.—Yet the doctrine and practice might still be as ancient as the world. H.—If it had not prevailed before, Judas would never have entertained such sentiments. W.—The Jews admit a sort of purgatory for “the prevaricators of Israel,” which differs from hell only in duration. They assert that the damned of their nation are exempt from suffering on the sabbath. Bartolocci. Leo v. 10. T. E.—Some Christians have supposed that the sin here specified was mortal, and the deceased in hell, yet prayer might be of service to them. Origen (Prin. iii. 6.) thought that even the devils would one day be liberated. S. Augustine (Ench. cx. 29.) says prayers “are of service, either that the remission may be entire, or surely that damnation itself may be more tolerable.” Most understand this of purgatory: but several explain it of the damned. Rrot. Bened.—A mass was formerly composed for this purpose, *tolerabilia fiant ipsa tormenta* *:* and some monks prayed for certain robbers slain, “that their pains might be diminished by the severe judge.” Aldrev. xxi. Excommunication might be taken off from the deceased. S. Greg. Dial. ii. 29.—Purgatory is for venial sins. Ib. iv. 39. This doctrine is proved beyond reply by various controvertists. C.  
**43** *Twelve.* Gr. “two.” Syr. “three.” S. Prosper. reads “12,000 talents.” Sacrifices for the dead were not enjoined, but the practice was then established, and this author take every opportunity of proving the resurrection against the Sadducees, who then began to appear. The Church of Christ has adopted the same practice. See Bellarm. Serar. &c. Our adversaries confess that such was the opinion of the Jews, and of the ancient doctors of the Church. But they declare it superstitious, and deny the authority of these books, which has been sufficiently established. Could such holy personages authorize superstition? Would Christ and his apostles have tolerated it? S. Paul prayed for Onesiphorus after his decease. 2 Tim. 1:16. See Mat. 12:33. Lu. 16:9 and 1 Cor. 3:13 and 15:29. Eus. Vita Const. iv. S. Epip. hær. lxxv. S. Cyp. i. ep. 9. Tert. &c. C.  
**45** *With godliness.* Judas hoped that these men who died fighting for the cause of God and religion, might find mercy; either because they might be excused from mortal sin by ignorance, or might have repented of their sin at least at their death. Ch.—Charity requires us to judge thus, when there are no positive proofs to the contrary. C.—Pope John VIII. answered the bishops of France, that those who died fighting against infidels were saved. Mabil. T. iii. An. Ben.—Judas might entertain the like hopes, though they are not always well grounded. H.  
**46** *Holy.* This text is so clear, that our adversaries judge it best to deny the book to be canonical. As that has been authentically proved, (Pref.) we shall only add that the Greek version, though differing in many points, is here as express as the Vulg. ( W.) 45. “considering that the best grace is laid up for those who sleep in piety. Holy and pious *is* the thought. ( H.) Wherefore he made reconciliation (*or* expiation) for the dead, that they might be delivered from sin,” or punishment due to it. W.—Sin is often taken for the punishment; and this effect of mortal sin may be remitted in purgatory, when the person has sincerely repented in this life. H.—To pass over other proofs, we will only mention S. Aug. (hær. liii.) and S. Bernard, (Cant. lxvi.) who plainly account those “heretics,” who deny purgatory. It is also worthy of notice that Judas, who acted thus charitably, was the high priest and defender of the true faith; and that the Jews still pray for the dead, as the book Mahzor, published by Genebrard, 1569, evinces. There they say, “Let him rest in peace,” and “ye angels of peace come forth to meet him.” But this is acknowledged by Munster and Fagius, (in Deut. 14) and by Whitaker.—*Sins.* Go to 1 B. 6:18. W.

## Chapter 13

**1** *Eupator* *.* Several of his generals had been already defeated. He therefore comes in person. 1 B. 6:28. C.—He was not above ten years old. But Lysias thought that his presence would animate the soldiers. H.  
**2** *A hundred and ten thousand*, &c. The difference between the numbers here set down and those recorded 1 Mac. 4 is easily accounted for, if we consider that such armies as these are liable to be at one time more numerous that at another, either by sending away large detachments, or being diminished by sickness, or increased by receiving fresh supplies of troops, according to different exigencies or occurrences. Ch.—There are many such difficulties in the Books of Kings, &c. Only some of the troops were permanent. W.—Most were auxiliaries, so that the number might often vary. Nothing is said of the chariots. 1 B. 6:30.  
**3** *Country.* He had continued at Antioch, as the Jews would not receive him. C. 4:24. C.—Yet now he pretended to be solicitous for their welfare, ( H.) only that he might obtain power.  
**4** *Evils.* The ambition of Jason and of Menelaus had brought on all these disturbances. C. 4:7. &c. and 1 B. 1:12.—*Place.* It would seem on the journey to Judea: but Josephus says he was slain after the king’s return, at Antioch. The sacred historian relates what concerns him together. C.—*In the.* Gr. “conducting him to Berea.” H.  
**5** *Down.* A beam was laid across the walls, on which the criminal, having been well regaled with wine, was placed till he fell among the ashes. V. Max. ix. 2.—Hystaspes invented this punishment. C.—*Prospect.* Gr. “organ, (or round instrument)” (Prot.) like a wheel, ( C.) “hanging (or whirling a person) on all sides headlong over the ashes. Thence all pushed him who was guilty of sacrilege, or of other crimes, forward to ruin.” H.—Syr. passes over v. 5 and 6. C.  
**9** *With.* Gr. “rendered barbarous by his designs,” ( H.) intending to punish the Jews worse than his father.  
**13** *Ancients.* The people were not convoked. C.  
**15** *Watchword* that night. W.—He usually gave some pious sentence. C. 7:23.—*Quarter.* Lit. “hall,” ( H.) a prætorium, or tent.—*Four.* Some Gr. and Lat. copies have “two.” Syr. “three,” though the old edit. of the Vulg. read, 14,000.—*Greatest*, carrying thirty-two men. 1 B. 6:37. Gr. also, “the chief over the elephants, with all his troops in the house,” ( H.) or the servants. C.—Prot. “will all that were upon him.” H.—This office was very considerable. C. 14:12. Grot. C.  
**21** *Prison.* This traitor was either in the camp or at Bethsura. C.  
**22** *Away.* Cæsar said in the same laconic style, *Veni, vidi, vici* *.* H.  
**23** *Overcome.* Hence Eleazar signalized himself. 1 B. 6:43.—*Rebelled.* Lysias persuaded him to treat the just exertions of Philip in this light. He was himself the usurper of the regency. He easily persuaded the young prince that peace was now most expedient; and conditions were granted to the Jews, which would have been very advantageous if they had been observed. But the king having offered sacrifice by the hands of the priests, and seeing the strength of the wall round Sion, ordered them to be demolished. C.  
**24** Gerrenians. Gerrus was on the frontiers of Egypt. Ptol.—It was formerly called Gerara. Gen. 20:1. The successors of Judas afterwards possessed this government. C.—Gr. “He made Hegemonides governor from,” &c. Usher, A. 3841.  
**25** *Of t* *he.* They disliked a Jewish governor, being always bitter against that nation. C. 6:8. and 1 B. 5:15 and 12:48. C.—Gr. “they *or* he raged, because they would break the agreements” ( H.) with the Jews, ( C.) or would revolt. Syr. Grot.

## Chapter 14

**1** *But.* Read 1 B. 7:1. W.—*Years* of Eupator’s reign, or dating from the purification of the temple.—Demetrius, to whom the crown belonged. 1 B. 7:1.  
**3** *Priest*, after Menelaus, (1 B. 7:5) but never recognized, as Judas was then pontiff. He had, moreover, voluntarily defiled himself during the times of persecution; or, according to most Gr. copies, ( C.) when there was “no mixture” of Gentiles in the land to instigate him. H.—Though he was of Aaron’s stock, this apostacy rendered him ineligible; Mathathias was chosen, being also descended from Aaron, and more sincere in religion. W.  
**4** *Fifty*, according to the Chaldee reckoning. C. 2:21. M.—*Boughs;* probably ( H.) of gold, ( W.) or adorned with leaves of that metal. People presented what they thought proper to the temple. The apostles admired these *gifts*, as well as the *stones* of the fabric. Lu. 21:5.  
**6** **Ver.** **6–11** **.** *Assideans* *:* the most zealous defenders of the faith. Alcimus had slain sixty of them. 1 B. 7:12. 19. C.—This description, given by enemies through malice, serves to shew the zeal and sincerity of these people in promoting God’s law and virtue.—*Him.* See 1 B. 7:26. W.—Alcimus was guilty of much falsehood. He was not of the family to which the high priesthood belonged, and he had rendered himself unworthy of it. v. 3, 7.  
**12** *Nicanor* *;* perhaps the same who had been defeated, C. 8:21. and 1 B. 4:8.  
**13** **V** **er.** **13** **.** *Great temple.* Such was the pagan’s idea of it. v. 31.  
**14** *Gentiles* and apostate Jews. C.—Such people and politicians advanced themselves by pillaging the faithful. W.  
**17** *Coming.* Gr. “silence,” (Bodwell) fearing some stratagem.  
**20** *Captain.* Judas laid the proposals before all the people.  
**24** *From the heart;* sincerely. C.—Gr. “he had Judas always in sight.” H.—His love was only apparent. T.—Yet this is contrary to the text, ( H.) and to the common opinion.  
**26** *His successor*, so as to keep Alcimus out of his office. C.  
**29** *The king.* Nicanor was a worldly politician, like Pilate and other judges who have no zeal for religion, ( W.) or for justice, being disposed to sacrifice all to their own interest. H.  
**30** *A few.* Gr. and Syr. “not a few.” H.—Nicanor attacked him, and lost 5000 men. 1 B. 12:27. C.  
**32** *Knew not.* This was true, and they would not seek for him ( W.) if it had been required.  
**33** *Bacchus:* a very suitable temple, when beaten to *the ground!* H.—He is styled Liber, and accounted the inventor of wine: hence drunkards dedicate temples to him. W.  
**37** *Jews.* No crime could be laid to his charge, but his love for religion and his country.  
**38** *Had held.* Gr. “when they were unmixed, had been judged for Judaism; ( H.) or been brought to judgment for keeping others from idolatry. Syr. C.  
**41** *He struck himself*, &c. S. Augustine (Epist. lxi. ad Dulcitium et lib. 2. cap. 23. ad Epist. 2. Gaud.) discussing this fact of Razias, says that the holy Scripture relates it, but doth not praise it, as to be admired or imitated, and that it was not well done by him, or at least not proper in this time of grace. Ch.—Whether he was thus inspired or not, we dare not decide. The Jews infer from the conduct of Samson, Saul, and Razias, that suicide is lawful when a person fears being overcome by torments, or giving occasion to other’s blasphemy. But Christianity lays down better maxims; (Rom. 3:8) and S. Aug. (c. Gaud. i. 31. and ep. 61 or 204) S. Thomas (ii. 2. q. 64. a. 5.) and others, disapprove of this action, observing that it is recorded and not praised, though other virtues of Razias be commended. C.—It was either not well done, or not to be imitated in this time of grace. S. Aug. ii. 23. contra ep. 2. Gaud. W.—Yet this holy doctor excuses Samson and some Christian virgins, by saying that they acted by the direction of the Holy Spirit. Sup. et de Civ Dei. i. 21. H. Lyran. Tirinius—This seems to be here the case, as the fact appears to be commended. M.  
**44** *Neck. Venit per medium cervicem* *.*—In the Greek it is κενεωνα, which signifies a void place, where there is no building; ( Ch. Grot.) and also “the belly,” which accounts for his not being killed on the spot. G.

## Chapter 15

**1** *But.* Read here 1 B. 7:39. W.—*Samaria.* Arab. “Sebaste,” which is the same. Yet Judas was at *Adarsa*, in the tribe of Ephraim. C.—*Sabbath.* The profane take advantage of people’s tender consciences. But Judas being well-informed, fought on the sabbath. 1 B. 3:40.  
**5** *Earth.* O Luciferian blasphemy! W.—He seems to place himself above the Lord of heaven. C.  
**6** *Public.* Gr. “common trophy over all the men of Judas.” H.—Syr. “he fortified himself exceedingly.” A trophy consisted of the trunk of a tree hung round with arms.  
**10** *Oaths*, of which Eupator had lately given an instance. Apollonius and the people of Joppe had acted perfidiously. C.  
**11** *Not with*, not only, or so much *with*, &c. H.—*Dream.* He knew it was supernatural ( C.) by God’s light, as S. Joseph did. Mat. 1:20. W.  
**12** *Onias* III. who had been slain ( C.) at Daphne. C. 4:34. H.—The Jewish and Christian Churches never doubted that the saints interceded in the other world for the living, in whose concerns they take part. C.—Prot. evade this text by denying the canonicity of the book. Yet the same is proved Gen. 48. Ex. 32. Jer. 15. Lu. 16. Apoc. 5:6. 8 and 2 Pet. 1 and we have a right to produce the authority of this book, as Origen, (18 in Jo.) S. Bern. (76 in Cant. & ser. 3. Nat. &c.) have done. Onias and *Jeremias*, in limbo, interested themselves for the faithful on earth, and no doubt the saints in glory will do as much. W.  
**15** *Gold*, such as kings and chief officers of Persia used. C.—Jeremias (38:17) had formerly dissuaded war: now he encourages it; as it also has a *time.* Eccle. 3:8. W.  
**17** *Fight.* Gr. “not to fortify the camp,” ( C.) or “remain there:” ( H.) μη στρατοπηδευεσθαι. C.—Grabe reads στρατευεσθαι, “to act as soldiers.” H.—Syr. “not to trust in troops set in array, but to take courage, and to expose their lives, in this extremity, for their country and for the temple.”  
**25** *Songs.* Gr. “pean,” sung in honour of Apollo. C.—Before battle his aid was thus invoked, and he was thanked with songs after a victory. Grot.  
**27** *Five.* Josephus has only 30,000. Ant. xii. 17. C.—*Presence.* He had granted them victory. M.  
**28** *Armour*, at the beginning of the battle. 1 B. 7:44.  
**29** *Language*, composing a canticle in Heb. or using such as had been written ( C.) by David, &c. H.  
**30** *Shoulder.* Thus his bust was set up. But the right arm was hung over-against the temple. v. 33 and 1 B. 7:47. C.  
**34** *Blessed.* Gr. “*raising their voices*, ( M.) or *looking* towards heaven, praised the Lord, who had made himself manifest:” επιφανη κυριον. H.  
**37** *Adar;* our February and March. The 13th was the feast, “of lots.” Est. 9:23. C.  
**38** *So.* Read 1 B. 8:1 where more on this subject is written. After other persecutors were overcome, the land was at rest, and the author adds this general conclusion. W.  
**39** *So.* Gr. “if in a frugal and middling style, this is as well as I was able.” H.—*Perfectly.* This is not said with regard to the truth of the narration, but with regard to the style and manner of writing, which in the sacred penmen is not always the most accurate. See S. Paul, 2 Cor. 11:6. Ch.—The style was frequently left to their choice. H.—Inspiration did not exclude natural acquirements. C.—The author is not afraid of having said any thing erroneous, though he might be less polished, like S. Paul: *imperitus sermone sed non sci* *entia* *.* But we, having now come to the end of the Old Testament, must crave pardon for any mistakes into which we may have fallen, in the execution of this work, which is dedicated to the English ( W.) and to all his majesty’s Catholic subjects, for whose benefit chiefly and for the sake of religion it has been undertaken. The *many things hard to understood*, which we did not wish to pass over, have swelled this work to a larger volume than was at first intended; larger, perhaps, than the purses of the poor and middle ranks, in the late hard times, could bear. But now the prospect is more cheering; and it is hoped that this profusion on a subject of such vast importance will be pardoned, particularly as we had also to comply with the desires of the more affluent, who repeatedly requested that the notes might be rather “more ample.” *As they that prepare a feast, and seek to satisfy the will of others*, so we, *for the sake of many, willingly undergo the labour.* C. 2:28. The variety of matter and of style may well be compared to a mixture of *wine* and *water.* v. 40. Yet our aim has not been merely to please, but rather to counteract the baneful influences of heresy and infidelity. T. Paine (Age of Reason, part 2nd) having touched upon a few difficulties in some of the books of Scripture, says exultingly: “I have gone through the Bible as a man would go through a wood, with an axe on his shoulders, and fell trees; here they lie, and the priests, if they can, may replant them. They may perhaps stick them in the ground, but they will never grow.” Yes, they will grow, and brave the fury of tempests, because they have been planted not by priest, but by the hand of God. The Scriptures and the Church will stand and support each other till time shall be no more. The true faith has been preserved from Adam through all succeeding generations, and antichrist himself will not be able to destroy it. *My WORD shall not pass away*, says our divine Master. As we have repeatedly proved this assertion in the foregoing notes, which are already perhaps too copious, we shall refer the more inquisitive reader to the remarks of Dr. Worthington on the six ages, in the Douay Bible.  
**40** *Always* *.* Gr. “only.” H.—Readers delight in variety. A middle style is adopted. C.—*But.* Gr. “But as wine mixed with water is pleasant, and affords delight, so the preparation (or style) of a discourse pleases the ears of those who read what is collected. But here shall be an end.” H.
