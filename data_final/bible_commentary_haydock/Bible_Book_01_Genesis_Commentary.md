# Genesis Commentary

The Hebrews now entitle all the Five Books of Moses, from the initial words, which originally were written like one continued word or verse; but the Sept. have preferred to give the titles the most memorable occurrences of each work. On this occasion, the Creation of all things out of nothing, strikes us with peculiar force. We find a refutation of all the heathenish mythology, and of the world’s eternity, which Aristotle endeavoured to establish. We behold the short reign of innocence, and the origin of sin and misery, the dispersion of nations, and the providence of God watching over his chosen people, till the death of Joseph, about the year 2369 (Usher) 2399 (Sal. and Tirin) B.C. 1631. We shall witness the same care in the other Books of Scripture, and adore his wisdom and goodness in preserving to himself faithful witnesses, and a true Holy Catholic Church, in all ages, even when the greatest corruption seemed to overspread the land. H.

*This***Book***is so called from its**treating of the***Generation**,*that is, of the Creation and the beginning of the world. The Hebrews call it***Bereshith**,*from the word with which it begins. It contains not only the History of the Creatio**n of the World, but also an account of its progress during the space of*2369*years, that is, until the death of***Joseph**.

## Chapter 1

**1** *Beginning.*As St. Matthew begins his Gospel with the same title as this work,*the Book of the Generation*, or Genesis, so St. John adopts the first words of Moses,*in the beginning;*but he considers a much higher order of things, even the consubstantial Son of God,*the same with God*from all eternity, forming the universe, in the beginning of time, in conjunction with the other two Divine Persons,*by the word of his power; for all things were made by Him*, the Undivided Deity. H.—Elohim, the*Judges*or Gods, denoting plurality, is joined with a verb singular,*he created*, whence many, after Peter Lombard, have inferred, that in this first verse of Genesis the adorable mystery of the Blessed Trinity is insinuated, as they also gather from various other passages of the Old Testament, though it was not clearly revealed till our Saviour came himself to be the*finisher of our faith.*C.—The Jews being a carnal people and prone to idolatry, might have been in danger of misapplying this great mystery, and therefore an explicit belief of it was not required of them in general. See Collet. &c. H.—The word**bara**,*created*, is here determined by tradition and by reason to mean a production out of nothing, though it be used also to signify the forming of a thing out of pre-existing matter. 21. 27. C.—The first cause of all things must be God, who, in a moment, spoke, and*heaven**and earth*were made, heaven with all the Angels; and the whole mass of the elements, in a state of confusion, and blended together, out of which the beautiful order, which was afterwards so admirable, arose in the space of six days: thus God was pleased to manifest his free choice in opposition to those Pagans who attributed all to blind chance or fate.*Heaven*is here placed first, and is not declared*empty*and dark like the earth; that we may learn to raise our minds and hearts above this land of trial, to that our true country, where we may enjoy God for ever. H.  
**2** *Spirit of God*, giving life, vigour, and motion to things, and preparing the waters for the sacred office of baptism, in which, by the institution of J. C., we must be born again; and, like spiritual*fishes*, swim amid the tempestuous billows of this world. v. Tert. &c. W. H.—This Spirit is what the Pagan philosophers styled the Soul of the World. C.—If we compare their writings with the books of Moses and the prophets, we shall find that they agree in many points. See Grotius. H.  
**3** *Light.*The sun was made on the fourth day, and placed in the firmament to distinguish the seasons, &c.; but the particles of fire were created on the first day, and by their, or the earth’s motion, served to discriminate day from the preceding night, or*darkness*, which was*upon the face of the deep.*H.—Perhaps this body of light might resemble the bright cloud which accompanied the Israelites, Ex. 14:19, or the three first days might have a kind of imperfect sun, or be like one of our cloudy days. Nothing can be defined with certainty respecting the nature of this primeval light. C.  
**4** *Good;*beautiful and convenient:—*he divided light*by giving it qualities incompatible with*darkness*, which is not any thing substantial, and therefore Moses does not say it was created. C.—While our hemisphere enjoys the day, the other half of the world is involved in darkness. S. Augustine supposes the fall and punishment of the apostate angels are here insinuated. L.*imp. de Gen.*H.  
**6** *A firmament.*By this name is here understood the whole space between the earth and the highest stars. The lower part of which divideth the waters that are upon the earth, from those that are above in the clouds. Ch.—The Heb.Rokiais translatedstereoma, solidity by the Sept., and expansion by most of the moderns. The heavens are often represented as a tent spread out, Ps. 103:3. C.  
**7** *Above the firmament*and stars, according to some of the Fathers; or these waters were vapours and clouds arising from the earth, and really divided from the lower waters contained in the sea. C.  
**11** *Seed in itself*, either in the fruit or leaves, or slips. M.—At the creation, trees were covered with fruit in Armenia, while in the more northern regions they would not even have leaves: Calmet hence justly observes, that the question concerning the season of the year when the world began, must be understood only with reference to that climate in which Adam dwelt. Scaliger asserts, that the first day corresponds with our 26th of October, while others, particularly the Greeks, fix it upon the 25th of March, on which day Christ was conceived; and, as some Greeks say, was born and nailed to the cross. The great part of respectable authors declare for the vernal equinox, when the year is in all its youth and beauty. H. See T. and Salien’s Annals, B.C. Christ 4053.  
**14** *For signs.*Not to countenance the delusive observations of astrologers, but to give notice of rain, of the proper seasons for sowing, &c. M.—If the sun was made on the first day, as some assert, there is nothing new created on this fourth day. By specifying the use and creation of these heavenly bodies, Moses shows the folly of the Gentiles, who adored them as gods, and the impiety of those who pretend that human affairs are under the fatal influence of the planets. See S. Aug. Confes. iv. 3. The Heb. termmohadim, which is here rendered*seasons*, may signify either*months*, or the*times for assembling*to worship God; ( C.) a practice, no doubt, established from the beginning every week, and probably also the first day of the*new moon*, a day which the Jews afterwards religiously observed. Plato calls the sun and planets the*organs of time*, of which, independently of their stated revolutions, man could have formed no conception. The day is completed in twenty-four hours, during which space the earth moves round its axis, and express successively different parts of its surface to the sun. It goes at a rate of fifty-eight thousand miles an hour, and completes its orbit in the course of a year. H.  
**16** *Two great lights.*God created on the first day*light*, which being moved from east to west, by its rising and setting made morning and evening. But on the fourth day he ordered and distributed this light, and made the sun, moon, and stars. The moon, though much less than the stars, is here called a*great light*, from its giving a far greater light to earth than any of them. Ch.—*To rule*and adorn, for nothing appears so glorious as the sun and moon. M.—Many have represented the stars, as well as the sun and moon, to be animated. Ecclesiasticus 16, speaking of the sun says,*the spirit goeth forward surveying all places:*and in Esdras 9:6, the Levites address God,*Thou hast made heaven and all the host thereof; and thou givest life t**o all these things, and the host of heaven adoreth thee.*S. Aug.*Ench.*and others, consider this question as not pertaining to faith. See Spen. in Orig. c. Cels. v. C.—Whether the stars be the suns of other worlds, and whether the moon, &c. be inhabited, philosophers dispute, without being able to come to any certain conclusion: for*God has delivered the world to their consideration for dispute, s**o that man cannot find out the work which God hath made from the beginning to the end*, Eccles. 3:11. If we must frequently confess our ignorance concerning the things which surround us, how shall we pretend to dive into the designs of God, or subject the mysteries of faith to our feeble reason? If we think the Scriptures really contradict the systems of philosophers, ought we to pay greater deference to the latter, than to the unerring word of God? But we must remember, that the sacred writings were given to instruct us in the way to heaven, and not to unfold to us the systems of natural history; and hence God generally addresses us in a manner best suited to our conceptions, and speaks of nature as it appears to the generality of mankind. At the same time, we may confidently asset, that the Scriptures never assert what is false. If we judge, with the vulgar, that the sun, moon, and stars are no larger than they appear to our naked eye, we shall still have sufficient reason to admire the works of God; but, if we are enabled to discover that the sun’s diameter, for example, is 763 thousand miles, and its distance from our earth about 95 million miles, and the fixed stars (as they are called, though probably all in motion) much more remote, what astonishment must fill our breast! Our understanding is bewildered in the unfathomable abyss, in the unbounded expanse, even of the visible creation.—Sirius, the nearest to us of all the fixed stars, is supposed to be 400,000 times the distance from the sun that our earth is, or 38 millions of millions of miles. Light, passing at the rate of twelve millions of miles every minute, would be nearly 3,000 years in coming to us from the remotest star in our stratum, beyond which are others immensely distant, which it would require about 40,000 years to reach, even with the same velocity. Who shall not then admire thy works and fear thee, O King of ages! Walker.—Geog. justly remarks, “we are lost in wonder when we attempt to comprehend either the vastness or minuteness of creation. Philosophers think it possible for the universe to be reduced to the smallest size, to an atom, merely by filling up the pores;” and the reason they allege is, “because we know not the real structure of bodies.” Shall any one then pretend to wisdom, and still call in question the mysteries of faith, transubstantiation, &c., when the most learned confess they cannot fully comprehend the nature even of a grain of sand? While on the one hand some assert, that all the world may be reduced to this compass; others say, a grain of sand may be divided*in infinitum!*H.  
**20** *Creeping:*destitute of feet like fishes, which move on their bellies. M.—*Fowl.*Some assert that birds were formed of the earth, but they seem to have the same origin as fishes, namely, water; and still they must not be eaten on days of abstinence, which some of the ancients thought lawful, Socrates v. 20. To conciliate the two opinions, perhaps we might say, that the birds were formed of mud, ( C.) or that some of the nature of fish, like barnacles, might be made of water and others of earth, C. 11. 19.—*Under:*Heb. on the face of the firmament, or in the open air. H.  
**22** *Blessed them*, or enabled them to produce others.—*Multiply:*the immense numbers and variety of fishes and fowls is truly astonishing.  
**26** *Let us make man to our image.*This*image*of God in man, is not in the body, but in the soul; which is a*spiritual*substance, endued with understanding and free-will. God speaketh here in the plural number, to insinuate the plurality of*persons*in the Deity. Ch.—Some of the ancient Jews maintained that God here addressed his council, the Angels; but is it probable that he should communicate to them the title of Creator, and a perfect similitude with himself? C.—Man is possessed of many prerogatives above all other creatures of this visible world: his soul gives him a sort of equality with the Angels; and though his body be taken from the earth, like the brutes, yet even here the beautiful construction, the head erect and looking towards heaven, &c. makes S. Aug. observe, an air of majesty in the human body, which raises man above all terrestrial animals, and brings him in some measure near to the Divinity. As Jesus assumed our human nature, we may assert, that we bear a resemblance to God both in soul and body. Tertullian (de Resur. 5.) says, “Thus that slime, putting on already the image of Christ, who would come in the flesh, was not only the work of God, but also a pledge.” H. See S. Bern. on Ps. xcix. W.  
**27** *Male and fema**le.*Eve was taken from Adam’s side on this same day, though it be related in the following chapter. Adam was not an hermaphrodite as some have foolishly asserted. C.—*Adam*means*the likeness*, or*red ea**rth*, that in one word we may behold our nobility and meanness. H.  
**28** *Increase and multiply.*This is not a precept, as some protestant controvertists would have it, but a blessing, rendering them fruitful: for God had said the same words to the*fishes and birds*, (ver. 22) who were incapable of receiving a precept. Ch.—*Blessed them*, not only with fecundity as he had done to other creatures, but also with dominion over them, and much more with innocence and abundance of both natural and supernatural gifts.—*Increase.*The Hebrews understand this literally as a precept binding every man at twenty years of age ( C.); and some of the Reformers argued hence, that Priests, &c. were bound to marry: very prudently they have not determined how soon! But the Fathers in general agree that if this were a precept with respect to Adam, for the purpose of*filling the earth*, it is no longer so, that end being sufficiently accomplished. Does not St. Paul wish all men to be like himself,*unmarried?*1 Cor. 7:1. 7. 8. H.  
**29** *Every herb*, &c. As God does not here express leave to eat flesh-meat, which he did after the deluge, it is supposed that the more religious part of mankind, at least, abstained from it, and from wine, till after that event, when they became more necessary to support decayed nature. H. M.—In the golden age, spontaneous fruits were the food of happy mortals. C.

## Chapter 2

**1** *Furniture*, ornaments or militia, whether we understand the Angels, or the stars, which observe a regular order and obey God. M.  
**2** *He rested*, &c. That is, he ceased to make any new kinds of things. Though, as our Lord tells us, John 5:17.*He still worketh*, viz. by conserving and governing all things, and creating souls. Ch.—*Seventh day*. This day was commanded, Ex. 20:8 to be kept holy by the Jews, as it had probably been from the beginning. Philo says, it is a the festival of the universe, and Josephus asserts, there is no town which does not acknowledge the religion of the sabbath. But this point is controverted, and whether the ancient patriarchs observed the seventh day, or some other, it is certain they would not fail, for any long time, to shew their respect for God’s worship, and would hardly suffer a whole week to elapse without meeting to sound forth his praise. The setting aside of stated days for this purpose, is agreeable to reason, and to the practise of all civilized nations. As the Hebrews kept Saturday holy, in honour of God’s rest, so we keep the first day of the week, by apostolic tradition, to thank God for the creation of the world on that day, and much more for the blessings which we derive from the Resurrection of J. C. and the sending down of the Holy Ghost, which have given it a title above all other days. H.*On the seventh day*, at the beginning of this verse, must be taken exclusively, as God finished his work on the 6th, whence the same Sept. and Syr. have here*on the 6th day.*H.—But the Heb. and all the other versions agree with the Vulgate. C.—The similarity of v. 6 and v. 7 in Heb. may have given rise to this variation. H.  
**4** *Day.*Not that all things were made in one day: but God formed in succession; first, heaven and earth, then the ornaments of both.*Every plant*, &c. which on the first day did not spring up, (as*water*covered the*surface of the earth*,) on the 3d, by the command of God, without having any man to plant, or rain to water them, pushed forth luxuriantly, and manifested the power of the Creator. H.—Thus Christ founded his Church by his own power, and still gives her increase; but requires of his ministers to co-operate with him, as a gardener must now take care of the plants which originally grew without man’s aid. D.—By observing that all natural means were here wanting for the production of plants, God asserts his sole right to the work, and confounds the Egyptian system, which attributed plants, &c. to the general warmth of the earth alone. C.  
**7** *Breath of life*or a soul, created out of nothing, and infused into the body to give it life. H.  
**8** *Of pleasure*, Heb.Eden, which may be either the name of a country, as C. 4:16 or it may signify pleasure, in which sense Symmachus and S. Jerom have taken it.—*From the beginning*, or on the 3d day, when all plants were created, Heb.mikedem, may also mean*towards the east*, as the Sept. have understood it, though the other ancient interpreters agree with S. Jerom. Paradise lay probably to the east of Palestine, or of that country where Moses wrote. The precise situation cannot be ascertained. Calmet places it in Armenia, others near Babylon, &c. Some assert that this beautiful garden is still in being, the residence of Henoch and Elias. But God will not permit the curiosity of man to be gratified by the discovery of it. C. 3:24. How great might be its extent we do not know. If the sources of the Ganges, Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates, be not now changed, and if these be the rivers which sprung from the fountains of Paradise, (both which are points undecided) the garden must have comprised a great part of the world, H., as the Ganges rises in Judea, and the Nile about the middle of Africa. T.  
**9** *The tree of lif**e.*So called, because it had that quality, that by eating of the fruit of it, man would have been preserved in a constant state of health, vigour, and strength, and would not have died at all.*The tre**e of knowledge.*To which the deceitful serpent falsely attributed the power of imparting a superior kind of knowledge beyond that which God was pleased to give. Ch.—Of what species these two wonderful trees were, the learned are not agreed. The*tree of knowledge*, could not communicate any wisdom to man; but, by eating of its forbidden fruit, Adam dearly purchased the knowledge of evil, to which he was before a stranger. Some say it was the fig-tree, others an apple-tree. Cant. 8:5. But it probably agreed with no species of trees with which we are acquainted, nor was there perhaps any of the same kind in paradise. T.  
**10** *A river*, &c. Moses gives many characteristics of Paradise, inviting us, as it were, to search for it; and still we cannot certainly discover where it is, or whether it exist at all at present, in state of cultivation. We must therefore endeavour to find the mystic Paradise, Heaven and the true Church; the road to which, though more obvious, is too frequently mistaken. See S. Aug. C. D. xiii. 21. Prov. 3:18. H.  
**15** *To dress it*. Behold God would not endure idleness even in Paradise. H.  
**17** *The death*of the soul, and become obnoxious to that of the body; thou shalt become a mortal and lose all the privileges of innocence. Though Adam lived 930 years after this, he was dying daily; he carried along with him the seeds of death, as we do, from our very conception. He had leave to eat of any fruit in this delicious garden, one only excepted, and this one prohibition makes him more eager to taste of that tree than of all the rest. So we struggle constantly to attain what is forbidden, and covet what is denied,*cupimusque negata**.*God laid this easy command upon Adam, to give him an opportunity of shewing his ready obedience, and to assert his own absolute dominion over him. Eve was already formed, and was apprised of this positive command, (C. 3:3) and therefore, transgressing, is justly punished with her husband. True obedience does not inquire*why*a thing is commanded, but submits without demur. Would a parent be satisfied with his child, if he should refuse to obey, because he could not discern the propriety of the restraint? If he should forbid him to touch some delicious fruits which he had reserved for strangers, and the child were to eat them, excusing himself very impertinently and blasphemously, with those much abused words of our Saviour,*It is not what enters into the mouth that defiles a man*, &c. would not even a Protestant parent be enraged and seize the rod, though he could not but see that he was thus condemning his own conduct, in disregarding, on the very same plea, the fasts and days of abstinence, prescribed by the Church and by God’s authority? All meats are good, as that fruit most certainly was which Adam was forbidden to eat; though some have foolishly surmised that it was poisonous; but, the crime of disobedience draws on punishment. H.—Even when the sin is remitted, as it was to Adam, the penalty is not of course released, as some have pretended. This also clearly appears in baptized infants, who suffer the penalties due to original sin, as much as those who have not been admitted to the laver of regeneration. S. Aug. W. T. &c.—If on this occasion, Eve had alone transgressed, as she was not the head, her sin would have hurt only herself. But with Adam, the representative of all his posterity, God made a sort of compact, (Ose. 6:7) giving him to understand, that if he continued faithful, his children should be born in the state of innocence like himself, happy and immortal, to be translated in due time to a happier Paradise, &c. but if he should refuse to obey, his sin should be communicated to all his race, who should be,*by nature, children of wrath.*—S. Aug. C. D. xvi. 27. Bede in Luc. xi. &c.— H. C.  
**20** *Names*, probably in the Hebrew language, in which the names of things, frequently designate their nature and quality. See Bochart.— C.  
**21** *A deep sleep.*Sept. “an ecstacy,” or mysterious sleep, in which Adam was apprised of the meaning of what was done, and how the Church would be taken from the side of Christ, expiring on the cross. M.  
**23** *Of my flesh.*God did not, therefore, take a rib without flesh, nor perhaps did he replace flesh without a rib in Adam’s side, though S. Aug. thinks he did. These words of Adam are attributed to God, Matthew 19, because they were inspired by him.—*Woman.*As this word is derived from man, so in Hebrew Isha (or Asse) comes from Iish or Aiss; Latin*vira*woman, and*virago*comes from*vir**.*H.—But we do not find this allusion so sensible in any of the Oriental languages, as in the Hebrew, whence another proof arises of this being the original language. C.  
**24** *One flesh*, connected by the closest ties of union, producing children, the blood of both. S. Paul, Eph. 5:23 discloses to us the mystery of Christ’s union with his church for ever, prefigured by this indissoluble marriage of our first parents. C.  
**25** *Not a**shamed*, because they had not perverted the work of God. Inordinate concupiscence is the effect of sin. H.
