# Proverbs Commentary

This book is so called, because it consists of wise and weighty sentences, regulating the morals of men; and directing them to wisdom and virtue. And these sentences are also called **Parab** **les,** because great truths are often couched in them under certain figures and similitudes. Ch.—Wisdom is introduced speaking in the nine first chapters. Then to ch. 25 more particular precepts are given. W.—Ezechias caused to be collected ( H.) what comes in the five next chapters, and in the two last. Some other, or rather Solomon himself, under ( W.) different titles, gives us Agur’s and his mother’s instructions, and his own commendations of a valiant woman, ( H.) which is prophetical of the Catholic Church. He also wrote the two next works, besides many other things, which have been lost. This is the first of those five, which are called “sapiential,” giving instructions how to direct our lives, by the dictates of sound reason. W.—It is the most important of Solomon’s works, though collected by different authors. C.—T. Paine treats Solomon as a witty jester. But his *jests* are of a very serious nature, and no one had before heard of his *wit.* Watson.

## Chapter 1

**1** *Israel.* The dignity of the author, and the importance of the subject, invite us to read. S. Bas.—Solomon is the first whose name is placed at the head of any work in Scripture. C.  
**2** **V** **er.** **2** **.** *To know.* This is the design of these parables. C.—They tend to instruct both the unexperienced and the wise. v. 5. There are three sorts of wisdom: the *divine*, which is God himself; (c. 3:16) the *supernatural*, which is his gift, to lead us into all virtue; and the *worldly*, which is mixed with error, &c. W. Wisd. 7:25.  
**4** *Subtilty.* Discretion to the innocent. C.  
**5** *Wiser.* “Tamdiu audiendum & discendum est, quamdiu nescias, & si proverbio credimus, quamdiu vivas,” says Seneca, ep. 77.—*Governments.* And be fit to govern others, ( W.) as well as himself. C.  
**6** *Sayings.* This science was much esteemed. 3 K. 10:1. Eccli. 39:2.  
**7** *Fear.* Thus we arrive at charity. S. Aug. in ep. Jo. ix. Job 28:28. &c. This fear includes religion, but not barren speculations. C.—It implies a desire to act, and not simply to understand.  
**8** *Mother.* The first precept is to learn of our elders, and the second to resist evil counsels. v. 10. W.—Our parents have the greatest influence over us. Solomon presupposes that they are virtuous and well informed. C.  
**10** *Entice.* Heb. “deceive.” C.—*Pessimum inimicorum genus laudantes* *.* Tacit. in vit. Agric.  
**12** *Pit.* Grave, or hell, like Dathan. Num. 16. This shews the greatest rage. Job 31:31.  
**17** *Wings.* If thou attend, therefore, to my instructions, their arts will be vain. Ven. Bede.—They unjustly seek to deceive the pious. C.—Watchfulness will be the best protection against them. W.  
**19** *Possessors.* Of money. C.—While they attempt to invade another’s property, they ruin themselves, and come to the gallows. H.  
**20** *Streets.* In every place we may learn wisdom. “The wise learn more from fools, than fools do from the wise,” as Cato well observed. C.  
**22** *Fools.* Heb. “and scorners delight in their scorning.” Prot.—Such are the pests of society. H.—They turn piety to ridicule, and will talk about things which they do not understand, like our *esprits forts*, ( C.) or pretended philosophers. H.  
**26** *Mock.* God is too much above us to act thus; but he will treat us as an enraged enemy. C.—In hell, the damned will cry in vain. v. 28. They had sufficient graces offered while they were alive. W.  
**28** *Fin* *d me.* Because their repentance was false, like that of Antiochus. 2 Mac. 9:13 and Ps. 11:4. C.  
**30** *Despised.* Lit. “destracted,” ( H.) supposing my threats would not be put in execution. Heb. “they abhorred.” C.  
**32** *Turning.* Heb. “the ease of the simple,” who have given way to deceit. C.—*Them.* The objects of their eager desires, prove their ruin. Ezec. 16:49.  
**33** *Evils.* Both the just and the wicked, (v. 31. H.) shall be treated according to their deserts. 2 Cor. 5:10. W.—Even in this world, the just enjoy the peace of a good conscience. M.

## Chapter 2

**1** *If.* This proves free will. To become truly wise, we must desire it with the same avidity as a miser seeks for riches. W.—We must also pray, (v. 3) with humility (v. 2) to God, the giver of wisdom. v. 6. Every science which has not Him for the beginning and end, is vain and dangerous. C.  
**7** *Salvation.* Prot. “sound wisdom.” *Tushiya* ( H.) often occurs in this book, and is very comprehensive, ( C.) denoting the substance ( H.) of goodness, virtue, &c. Job 5:12.  
**8** *Justice.* In his servants. C.—God gives them grace to follow virtue, ( H.) and protects them from every danger. C.  
**12** *Things.* The danger of such company for young people is very great, as the heart is misled by the understanding, ( C.) if it do not itself shew the way to error. H.—We all possess a fund of corruption. C.  
**14** *Evil.* These signs prove whom we ought to shun. S. Aug. depicts his own conduct before his conversion in the darkest colours. C.  
**16** *Strange.* Idolatress, (Grot.) or rather the abandoned woman, whether married or not. C.—This description, as well as the former, guards us against heretics, who leave *the right way* of the Catholic Church, (v. 13) and devise *perverse* doctrines of rebellion against princes, &c. as if faith alone were sufficient. By this faith, Prot. do not mean any article which all must believe, but only that each one must be convinced that he himself is just, and will be saved. Like the strange woman, they preach a comfortable doctrine, and use sweet speeches. Rom. 16:18. Their conversion is a very difficult matter, (v. 19) because they are condemned by their own judgment, (Tit. 3:11) and will not admit of the ordinary means of instruction in the Church. W.  
**17** *Youth.* Her husband, whom she married young when love is more lasting. This increases her guilt. It may also signify her father, or preceptor.  
**18** *God.* The law forbids adultery, and all impurities. Deut. 23:17. Lev. 20:10. Both the parties, guilty of adultery, were punished with *death.* C.  
**19** *Life.* A sincere conversion is so rare among people once addicted to impurity, ( H.) which resembles a deep pit. C.—This illness is hardly removed. M.  
**21** *Earth.* Happily. This was the wish of the carnal Jews. But the more enlightened raise their thoughts to heaven.

## Chapter 3

**1** *My son.* God speaks, or the master instructs his disciple. v. 21. C.—We must remember and love instruction, and reduce it to practice. W.  
**2** *Peace.* These prefigured more substantial blessings. C.  
**3** *Truth.* Be kind and faithful to all. Gen. 24:27. Ps. 24:10.  
**4** *Good.* Sept. “forecast good before the Lord and men.” S. Paul seems to allude to this version, Rom. 12:17 and 2 Cor. 8:22. H.  
**5** *All.* God will have nothing by halves.—*Lean not.* By pride. 2 Cor. 12:13. All must be referred to God. C.—In him we may safely trust. W.  
**8** *Bones.* Thou shalt enjoy perfect health.  
**9** *Fruits.* Sept. add, “of justice;” to intimate that no presents will be acceptable, which have been unjustly acquired.  
**11** *Him.* Correction is rather a proof of love than of anger. Ps. 3:9. C.—God thus shews that he approves of his servants; and therefore his other promises, which seem of a temporal nature, must be understood with reference to the next life. W.  
**12** *And as.* Sept. “but he scourgeth every son whom he receiveth,” as S. Paul quotes this passage. Heb. 12:6. The verb is now wanting in Heb. or ceab; “as a father” may signify “*scourgeth*, in piel, ( M.) with *i* prefixed. C.  
**15** *Riches.* Heb. peninim, ( H.) “pearls.” Job 28:18. C.  
**16** *Glory.* Her hands are full, and she grants favours with profusion, ( H.) as with both hands, promising eternal life. W.  
**18** **Ve** **r.** **18** **.** *Life.* Like that planted in paradise. Gen. 2:9.  
**19** *Wisdom.* Hitherto he had spoken of that virtue. Now he treats of the uncreated wisdom, ( C.) which is God the Son. M. Jans. S. Greg. Mor. xii. 4.  
**20** *Out.* The higher and lower waters being divided, ( C.) or the channels formed to receive the waters. Piscat.—It may also speak of the deluge. Ven. Bede.—*With.* Heb. “have distilled dew.” This is so copious, as to resemble rain in Palestine. Judg. 6:37 and 2 K. 17:12.  
**22** *Mouth.* There have been wise and virtuous men afflicted, v. 11. But they have borne all with patience, and have merited a more glorious reward than what this earth could afford. C.  
**27** *Able.* Prot. “withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.” Relieve the distressed. H.—They have a title to that wealth, since those who possess it are bound to relieve the indigent. C.—Sept. “refrain not from doing good,” &c. H.  
**28** *Present.* Alms in season are doubly valuable. W.—Antigonus acquired the title of Δωσων, “about to give,” as he never gave, (Plutarch) but only promised.  
**30** *Cause.* We may defend ourselves; but herein great discretion is necessary. C.—*Cum pari contendere anceps est: cum superiore furiosum; cum inferiore sordidum* *.* Senec. Prov.  
**31** *Ways.* Of injustice. Seek not to attain his prosperity by the same means. C.  
**33** *Want.* Heb. “a curse.”—*Shall be.* Heb. “he blesseth.” H.  
**34** *Scorners.* Lit. “he will delude the scorners.” H.—He will treat them as they would treat others. Ps. 17:27. C.—Sept. “the Lord resisteth the proud,” &c. So the apostles quote this passage. 1 Pet. 5:5. Jam. 4:6. H.  
**35** *Disgrace.* They are seen by more, and their fall is more dangerous. C.—“A fool extols what is ignominious.” Pagn. H.  

---

## Chapter 4

**1** *Father.* He shews the greatest respect for his parents, v. 3. C.  
**3** *As.* This is not expressed. H.—But Solomon was not the only son of Bethsabee, as S. Luke (3:23) specifies Nathan, his brother. See 2 K. 12:24. Sept. have “beloved in,” &c.  
**4** *He.* Heb. is masculine. C.—As David instructed his son, so the latter teaches all how they may learn wisdom. W.  
**7** *Beginning.* The first part of wisdom is to desire it. For nothing hindereth from being just, but that justice is not desired. S. Aug. in Ps. 118:20. W.—“Wisdom is the principal part; *therefore* get,” &c. Prot. H.—It is the one thing necessary. C.—The pearl, to acquire which we must part with every thing else, if required. Matt. 13:46. M.  
**17** *Wickedness.* Acquired thereby, or they make sin their food. C. 26:6.  
**18** *Day.* They are children of light, (Jo. 12:35) and give edification, always advancing in virtue. M.  
**19** *Fall.* They are unconcerned about sin, and neither avoid it, nor strive to repent. C.  
**22** *Flesh.* All may derive benefit from their consideration. H.  
**23** *From it.* As the heart is the principal part of the body, so the will is the chief power of the soul, from which good or evil proceeds. W.—A clean heart gives life, a corrupt one, death. Mat. 15:11. 19.  
**24** *From thee.* Neither detract, nor give any countenance to detractors.  
**25** *Steps.* Be attentive to thy own affairs. Prov. 17:24.  
**26** *Straight.* Heb. “ponder.” Examine what thou takest in hand, and walk not at random. Heb. 12:13.  
**27** *For*, &c. What follows in not in Heb. or the Complut. ( C.) Sept. But it is in the Roman, &c. ( H.) and in the new edition of S. Jerom, as it was explained by Ven. Bede. Lyran and Cajetan reject it. C.

## Chapter 5

**2** *Thoughts.* Or wisdom; and act with discretion.—*Mind*, &c. is omitted in Heb. and S. Jer. C.—By *woman* all concupiscence, or the inducement to sin, is commonly understood. We must not think of such things. W.  
**4** *Sword.* “It is a crime even to hearken.” S. Amb. de Abrah. ii. 11. She seeks thy ruin. v. 5 c. 2:16.  
**6** *They.* Heb. “if perhaps thou ponder the path of life.” Pagn. H.—Or “she ponders not,” &c. She walks inconsiderately, and consults only her passions. c. 7:10. C.—No one can depend on her love. M.  
**9** *Strangers.* The world, the flesh, and the devil are such; cruelly devising our ruin. W.  
**10** *Strength.* Or children. v. 16. Gen. 49:3. C.  
**11** *Body.* He alludes to a shameful disease, the just punishment of intemperance. Eccli. 19:3.  
**14** *Evil.* Infirm and worn out, having lost my reputation, &c. C.—Though I lived among the faithful, I was under no restraint. M.  
**15** *Well.* Live comfortably on your own property, (Cajet.) with your own wife.  
**16** *Waters.* Mayst thou have a numerous offspring, (v. 10) and be liberal. Many copies of the Sept. &c. have a negation, with Aquila, “let not thy,” &c. ( C.) though it my be read with and interrogation, “are the waters of thy fountain to be?” &c. De Dieu.—By not means. Origen (in Num. 12) acknowledges both readings. C.—Good instructions must be given to those who are well disposed, but not to scoffers, or obstinate infidels. W.—Husbands are exhorted to be content with their own wives, (v. 15. 20) so that the negative particle seems to be here wanting, as it is, c. 6:17 in MS. 60, (Kennicott) and c. 14:33. Sept. &c. Capellus.  
**17** *Thee.* Stick to thy own wife. In a moral sense, let those who instruct others, take care not to neglect themselves.  
**18** *Vein.* Thou shalt have a numerous progeny. Ps. 67:28. Is. 48:1. C.  
**19** *Love.* This is spoken by way of permission, and to withdraw people from unlawful connections. Eccle. 2:1 and 1 Cor. 7:29. C.  
**22** *Ropes.* “Evil habits unrestrained induce a necessity,” (S. Aug. Conf. viii. 5.) though not absolute. H.—The libertine thinks he can get free as soon as he pleases; not being aware of the chains which he is forging for himself. C.—Sin requires punishment. M.  

---

## Chapter 6

**1** *Hand.* Agreements were made by shaking hands, Is. 62:8. Xen. Anab. iii.—*Stranger.* Sept. “enemy.” He will presently be such, or thy friend’s creditor will soon lay hold on thee. By standing surety for another, we expose ourselves to be ruined by his negligence. C.—The Persians had a horror chiefly of lying and debts. Herod. i. 138.—All sureties are not condemned, but only such as are inconsiderate. M.—A diligent compliance with engagements is commended. W.  
**3** *Make.* Heb. “humble thyself, and made sure thy friend,” (Prot.) entreating ( H.) and forcing him to pay his debts. The Fathers apply this to pastors, who have undertaken to direct others. Their soul is at stake. S. Greg. C.  
**8** *Harvest.* The economy and diligence of this littel republic is admirable. Pliny, xxx. 11.—Some copies of the Sept. add with S. Amb. (Hex. v. []1. &c. C.) “or go to the bee, and behold what a worker it is, and how beautiful is its work; whose labours kings and private people use for health. But it is desirable and glorious to all; and though it be weak in strength, by the love of wisdom it has got forward” ( H.) in esteem. C.—Nature has given the form of a monarchy in bees, and of a democracy in the regulations of the ant. Tournemine.  
**11** *A traveller.* Sept. add, “wicked,” and Heb. gives the idea of a robber. M.—*But*, &c. This is not in Heb. Complut. or S. Jerom. C.  
**12** *Apostate.* Heb. “of Belial, without restraint of religion and law. C.—Deut. 13:13. M.—Every one who sins through malice and particularly heretics, employ all their members to pervert others. W.—*Mouth.* No reliance can be had on his promises. C.  
**13** *Finger.* These signs imply haughtiness, &c. Ps. 34:19. Is. 58:9. The posture indicates the interior sentiments, (S. Amb. off. i. 18.) insomuch, that S. Ambrose would not receive among the clergy one whose gestures were too light. The Persians still speak by signs. C.  
**16** *Detesteth.* This expression does not always mean that the last is worse than the former. M.—All the six sins are damnable, but the seventh is here, most so, being against charity and unity, and the devil’s sin. W.—Lying seems to be reprobated by three different terms. C.  
**23** **V** **er.** **23** **.** *Instruction.* Given for our improvement, ( H.) with charity. See Deut. 6:6. Ps. 18:9.  
**24** *Stranger.* This is often inculcated, because nothing is more dangerous in youth, nor more contrary to the study of wisdom.  
**26** *Woman.* Who is married, exposes her lover to the danger of death. She chooses the most accomplished men, while the harlot receives the first comer. C.  
**27** *Burn.* No one can deal with an adulteress without guilt. M.—All probable occasions of sin must be shunned. W.  
**29** *Clean.* Or be left unpunished. No crime disturbs the order of society so much, nor is pardoned with more difficulty.  
**30** *The fault is not so great*, &c. The sin of theft is not so great, as to be compared with adultery: especially when a person pressed with hunger (which is the case here spoken of) steals to satisfy nature. Moreover the damage done by theft may much more easily be repaired, then the wrong done by adultery. But this does not hinder but that theft also is a mortal sin, forbidden by one of the ten commandments. Ch.—Heb. “they will not despise a thief, when he hath stolen to fill his soul, when he is hunger.” Mont. H.—This was commonly supposed to be his motive, and he was only condemned to make restitution, without any further disgrace. C. 19:24. Ex. 22:1. But what necessity could the adulterer plead? Both he and the woman must suffer death. Lev. 20:10.  
**31** *Seven-fold.* Or as much as may be required. The law never subjected the thief to restore above five-fold. If he had not enough, his person might be sold. C.  
**32** *Folly.* Lit. “want,” *inopiam* *.* Heb. “is faint-hearted, corrupting his own soul, he will do that.” H.  
**35** *Gifts.* “A husband would rather hear that his wife had been slain, than that she had been defiled.” S. Jer. in Amos vi.  

---

## Chapter 7

**1** *Words.* As dangerous temptations always threaten, the same instructions are frequently inculcated. W.  
**5** *Thine.* But another’s. v. 19. Give thy heart to wisdom, that it may be guarded against impure love.  
**6** *Lattice.* No glass was used, on account of the great heat. C.  
**7** *Ones.* Not in age, but prudence. M.  
**10** *Attire.* Covered with a veil, (Gen. 38:15) though different from that of honest women. C.—The wanton are commonly the most gaudy; *nullarum fere pretiosior cultus est quam quarum pudor vilis est* *.* S. Cyp. de Habitu.—*Prepared*, &c. Heb. “guarded,” ( C.) or “subtle of heart.” Prot. “who makes the hearts of youths take flight.” Sept. Cant. 6:4. H.  
**11** *Not … quiet.* Is not in Heb. C.—“She is loud and stubborn, her feet abide not in her house.” Prot. H.—Chaste women are guarded in their speech, and keep at home. M.  
**14** *Prosperity.* Or thy welfare, (Corn. a Lap. T.) so great is my love for thee. M.—*Vows.* And therefore I have a feast prepared. People might carry home the greatest part of the victim to eat, if they were clean. Lev. 7:29. C.  
**16** *Cords.* For greater ease, instead of boards, ( M.) or the curtains are hung with precious cords from Egypt. C.  
**17** *Aloes.* Of Syria, (Jo. 19:39) different from ours. Num. 34:6. C.  
**18** *Inebriated.* Prot. “take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.” H.—This passion is a sort of intoxication. M.  
**19** *My.* Lit. “the man.” H.—She speaks thus out of contempt. C.  
**20** *The day.* Sept. “after many days.” Heb. “at the day concealed,” or when the people will dwell under tents, (Chal. C.) or “at the new moon,” when it does not appear. Piscat.—He will not return for a long time, so that we need apprehend no danger from him. M.  
**22** *Lamb.* Prot. “fool to the correction of the stocks,” ( H.) or “like a shackle (ábs.) for the chastisement of a fool.” Mont.—Interpreters have read different words. C.—Sinners who have given way to temptations, are as inconsiderate as oxen, or birds which hasten to their own ruin. W.  
**26** *Her.* Solomon gave a melancholy proof of this, as well as David, and Amnon. C.  
**27** *Death.* There can be no precaution too great. c. 2:18. C.  

---

## Chapter 8

**1** *Voice.* Men are wanting to themselves: they cannot plead ignorance. C.—Wisdom stands on high in the Catholic Church inviting all to virtue and happiness. W.—Some explain this of the light which is communicated to men; but the Fathers apply it to Jesus Christ, some of the expressions regarding his divinity, and others his human nature. Eccli. 24.  
**3** *Doors.* Amid disputants, whose eagerness ought to convince us of the preference due to wisdom over all terrestrial concerns. v. 10.  
**10** *Money.* They are generally incompatible.  
**12** *Thoughts.* All good comes from God, the eternal wisdom, ( C.) which speaks here. W.  
**15** *Things.* Power and knowledge are the gift of the Almighty. Rom. 12:1. A prince who resembles God the most, is his best present. Pliny in Trajan.  
**18** **Ve** **r.** **18** **.** *Glorious.* Lit. “proud.” H.—But here it only means great. Is. 9:15 and 61:6. Riches too commonly nourish pride, and it is very rare to see them joined with *justice.* C.  
**19** *Stone.* So the Sept. translate paz, ( H.) which designates a more pure sort of gold. Gen. 2:11. C.  
**21** *Enrich.* Heb. “grant what is (real goods) an inheritance to them,” &c.—*Treasures.* Sept. add, “with goods. If I announce to you daily occurrences, I will admonish you to number the things of the world,” ( H.) and all past events. C.  
**22** *Possessed.* As Christ was *with God*, equal to him in eternity. Jo. 1. Sept. “created,” which many of the Fathers explain of the word incarnate, (see Corn. a Lapide. Bossuet) or he hath “placed me,” (S. Athan. iii. con. Arian. Euseb.) a pattern of all virtues. The Sept. generally render *kana*, “possessed,” as Aquila does here. C.  
**23** *Up.* Heb. “anointed.” Sept. “he founded.” Christ was appointed to be the foundation, on which we must be built. S. Athan. iii. Orat.  
**24** **Ver** **.** **24** **.** *Conceived.* Having yet manifested none of my works. Since the creation, wisdom only seeks to communicate itself to us. C.  
**26** *Poles.* Heb. “head *or* height of the dust of the world.” H.—I subsisted with the chaos, before things appeared in their present form. C.—The *poles* denote the north and south, or the four quarters of the world. M.  
**28** *Sky.* Prot. “clouds.” Pagn. “the air.” Vulg. *æthera* *.* Sept. “the clouds above.” H.—Moses assigns the higher and lower waters the same origin. Gen. 1:7.  
**29** *Pass.* This is often remarked. Ps. 41:8.—*Earth.* See Job 38:8. C.  
**30** *Forming.* Heb. “one nursed,” ( C.) or nursing, *nutritius* *.* Pagn.—He was not an idle spectator.—*Playing.* With ease and surprising variety. C.  
**31** *Men.* God saw that all was good, but delighted most in his own image. M.—He prefers man before all other corporeal creatures. W.—To him alone below he has granted understanding, and a soul capable of virtue. The Son has also assumed our nature. Bar. 3:37.  
**35** *L* *ord.* Wisdom, or Jesus Christ, is our salvation, happiness, and life. Sept. “and the will is prepared by the Lord.” S. Aug. often quotes this to prove the necessity of preventing grace. Ep. ccxvii. and clxxxvi. C.  
**36** *Death.* Not in itself, ( H.) but by adhering to such things as bring death. M.  

---

## Chapter 9

**1** *House.* The sacred humanity, (S. Ignat. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. xvii. 20.) or the Church. S. Greg. Mor. xxxiii. 15.—Here we may receive *all* instruction, the seven sacraments, and the gifts of the Holy Ghost. Pleasure had mentioned here attractions: now those of true wisdom are set before us. C.—God sent his pastors at all times, to invite people to embrace the latter. They are all included in the number *seven*, both before and under the law, as well as in the gospel, where S. Paul styles SS. Peter, James, and John, *pillars.* Gal. 2. This is the literal sense, on which the mystical is grounded, and both are intended by the Holy Ghost, intimating that the uncreated wisdom took flesh of the blessed Virgin, prepared the table of bread and wine, as Priest according to the order of Melchisedec, and chose the weak of this world to confound the strong, as S. Aug. explain this passage. Sup. and q. 51. W.  
**2** *Victims.* Moses ordered the blood to be poured out at the door of the tabernacle, and a part given to the priests, after which the rest might be taken away. The like was probably done at Jerusalem. Lev. 17:4. These victims are contrasted with those of pleasure. c. 7:14.—*Mingled.* It was not customary for any but barbarians and the gods to take pure wine. Some mixed two, others three, five, or even twenty parts of water. But the scholiast of Aristophanes says, the best method was to have three parts water, and two of wine. Mercury complains that his wine was half water. Arist. Plut. v. Sun. i.—The Fathers often apply this text to the feast of Jesus Christ in the blessed Eucharist. C.—S. Cyprian (ep. iii.) citeth the whole passage of Christ’s sacrifice in the forms of bread and wine. W.  
**3** *Maids.* Sept. “servant men,” the pastors of the church, inviting all to piety in so public a manner, that none can plead ignorance. S. Greg. C.—*To invite.* Prot. “she crieth upon the highest places of the city.” H.—Christ enjoins his apostles to preach on the roofs. Matt. 10:37.  
**4** *One.* Simple, but not inconstant, like children. 1 Cor. 14:20. Pleasure addresses the same, (c. 7:7) but for their destruction. C.  
**7** *Scorner.* This is the reason why wisdom speaks only to the simple. The conceited would only laugh at her instructions. These scoffers represent heretics and libertines. c. 1:22. C.—Where there is no hope of amendment, prudence and charity require us to be silent, as our rebukes would only procure us enmity, and make the sinner worse. W.—Of such S. John was afraid, and therefore ceased from writing. 3 Jo. 9. Yet S. Paul commands public reprehension. 1 Tim. 5:20. M.—When there is any prospect of good, all, particularly superiors, are bound to correct. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. i. 9.; and S. Bas. reg. fus. 158. W.  
**9** *Occasion.* This word is found in Sept. Syr. and Arab. We might supply *instruction*, ( C.) with Prot.  
**10** *Prudence.* Or “prudence is the science of the saints,” ( H.) directing what to choose on all occasions to obtain heaven. C.—The knowledge contained in the holy Scriptures, and possessed by the saints, is superior to all other sciences. M.  
**13** *And full.* Prot. “she is simple and knoweth nothing.” Sept. “is in want of a piece of bread.” They have several verses before this, which are here omitted. H.—Wisdom and pleasure are opposed to each other. C.  
**17** *Pleasant.* Impure pleasures are more delightful ( C.) to sensual men. H.—The prohibition increases appetite. M.  
**18** *Giants.* Who lived when all flesh had corrupted its ways, (Gen. 6:12) and were sentenced to hell. Job 26:5. Is. 14:9. C.

## Chapter 10

**1** *Mother.* A virtuous child cannot be indifferent to the joy of his parents.  
**2** *Wickedness.* Riches ill acquired, or tending to corrupt the heart. Lu. 16:9.  
**3** *Famine.* Ps. 36:25. The prophets and Lazarus rejoice in suffering.  
**4** *Poverty.* Even of those who had plenty. This is true in a spiritual sense likewise. C.—The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence. H.—*Otiositas mater nugarum, noverca virtutum* *.* S. Bern. consid. ii.—*He*, &c. This is not in Heb. Greek, S. Jer. or in several Latin copies. C.—We find it in the Sept. C. 9:13.—*Away.* He derives no benefits from lies. M.  
**5** *He.* Sept. “a son well educated shall be wise, and shall have the unwise for his servant. An intelligent son has been saved from the heat. But the wicked son is destroyed by the wind in time of harvest.” H.—A good part of this is not in the original; yet it is received by the Greeks.  
**6** *Wicked.* Or, as the Heb. seems to indicate, “the wicked covereth iniquity, by an hypocritical exterior,” ( C.) or, “the injury” (Mont.) done to another, (*chamas.* H.) “unseasonable, *or* infinite mourning,” πενθος αωρον. Sept.  
**7** Rot. Heb. “stink.” His reputation shall be lost. Gen. 34:20. C.  
**8** *Lips.* He will not bear correction. M.—But suffers the punishment of his own unguarded speeches; or rather the man who hath foolish lips, shall be beaten, v. 13. C.  
**9** *Sincerely.* Or Simply, Heb. “in uprightness,” ( H.) or innocence. M.—*Manifest.* The hypocrite shall be at last detected.  
**10** *Sorrow.* Sept. add, “to men as well as to himself.” C.—“But he who chides boldly shall make peace,” ( H.) or “work safety,” as the Syr. and Arab. also read, instead of Heb. “a prating fool shall fall.” “When a man connives at his friend’s failings, … the offender is encouraged to sin on, and to heap up matter for very sorrowful reflections; but the man, who with an honest freedom, prudently reproves him, most effectually contrives his honour and safety.” The consequences of a virtuous and a vicious *friendship*, seem to be also expressed in the next verse. Thus the latter hemistic generally illustrates the first. But here, part of v. 8 may be improperly inserted. The two parts of the verses in Proverbs, &c. being arranged in distinct columns, has occasioned sometimes a part, and sometimes a whole verse, to be omitted, as the transcriber might mistake the line. Kennicott.  
**11** *Life.* Or a never-failing spring, *fons perennis*, as we should speak in Latin. C. 13:14. Apoc. 7:17.  
**12** *Sins.* Sept. “all who contend.” Charity pardons all. 1 Pet. 4:8.  
**13** *Sense.* Lit. “a heart.” But the Hebrews use this expression in a different sense from what we do, and thus designate a fool. Ose. 7:11.  
**14** *Conf* *usion.* He speaks inconsiderately, and involves himself in continual dangers, while the wise are cautious in their speech.  
**15** *Poverty.* Diffidence hinders the advancement of the poor, as presumption is too common among the rich. A happy mediocrity is best. v. 16.  
**16** *Life.* In abundance he is not puffed up; but the wicked make use of their fruit or revenue to do evil. Their works are bad, unless they turn to God by at least an initial love of justice.  
**18** *Foolish.* We must neither dissemble our resentment, through hypocrisy, nor manifest it without reason. C.  
**19** *Sin.* A prolix discourse on subjects of importance is not reprehended. S. Aug. Retrac. 1.—But it is very difficult to speak much, without going against some virtue. C.  
**21** *Understanding.* Lit. “hear.” H. v. 13.  
**23** *Man.* He is enabled to see the evil of sin, and to avoid it. Job 15:16.  
**26** *Him.* He spoils all their projects, ( C.) and becomes a nuisance.  
**29** *Evil.* conscience upbraids them, and punishment is before their eyes. H. *Magna vis est conscientiæ* *.* Cic. pro Mil.  
**30** *Earth.* This the Jews frequently experienced. The more enlightened understood, that such promises regarded also eternity. C.

## Chapter 11

**1** *Balance.* Both in commerce, (Deut. 25:13. C.) and in passing sentence on others. Ven. Bede.  
**2** *Wisdom.* God resists the proud. c. 16:18 and 18:12 and Jam. 4:6.  
**7** Solicitous. Or ambitious. Heb. “the potent,” or Sept. “the impious.”  
**8** *For him.* As comparatively nothing worth to his master. C. 21:18. Is. 43:3  
**11** *Overthrown.* Ten just men would have saved Sodom. Achan alone threw all Israel into confusion. C.  
**12** *Mean.* Lit. “indigent” of sense. H.—We must put up with some faults, as none are without. Hor. i. Sat. 3. C.  
**13** *Walketh.* Sept. “the double-tongued,” dissembler, or great talker. C.  
**15** *That is.* Heb. “that hateth those who make agreements *is* secure.” Mont.  
**16** *Gracious.* Virtuous and beautiful, as God hath granted beauty also for good purposes. This and virtue tend to the advancement of women, while men can use their strength to acquire riches. C.—*Glory.* Sept. Syr. and Arab. add, “of her husband. But she that hateth righteousness is a throne of disgrace. The slothful, though rich, shall come to poverty; but the laborious shall retain their riches.” Two hemistics seem to be lost in Heb. Kennicott.—Most of the additions in the Sept. are only glosses, or useless repetitions, ( C.) though they seem not to be so in this place. H.  
**17** *Kindred.* Heb. “flesh.” Gen. 29:14. The miser is cruel even to himself.  
**21** *In ha* *nd.* At rest, or making agreements. God will punish the race of the wicked.  
**22** *Foolish.* Beauty, without prudence, leads to ruin, as ornaments are ill bestowed on swine. The women in the east sometimes wore rings in their noses, (Gen. 24:22. C.) or hanging down upon them. Is. 3:21. M.  
**24** *Others.* Moderation is always requisite. Heb. “there is one withholding from rectitude, yet for a defect,” (Mont.) being too saving, he is a loser. H.—Avarice does not always increase riches. C.  
**25** *Himself.* He shall receive abundantly. 2 Cor. 9:6. The beneficent shall be amply rewarded both in this world and in the next.  
**26** *Corn.* In times of scarcity. See Amos 8:7.  
**29** *House.* By his profligacy, or law-suits, shall be impoverished, (v. 17. C.) or if he act with violence, he will make his house empty. Eccli. 4:35. M.  
**30** *Life.* Producing excellent fruits of virtue and edification.  
**31** *Receive.* Punishment, for almost inevitable faults, or be treated according to his deserts. Sept. Syr. and Arab. “if the just be hardly saved, where shall the impious and the sinner appear?” 1 Pet. 4:18. C.—Afflictions attend the just in this life. Shall the wicked escape? M.

## Chapter 12

**1** *Knowledge.* It is a great kindness to shew us our faults. But God’s grace is necessary to make us reap benefit from correction, ( C.) as self-love recoils at it.  
**2** *But.* Heb. “and he will condemn the man of devices,” (Mont. H.) or, “the man of thoughts doth wickedly,” ( C.) as he trusts in them, rather than in God. M.  
**4** *Diligent.* Heb. “strong or virtuous,” ( H.) including all the perfections of the sex, and in particular those of economy and chastity. C. 14:1 and 31:10.  
**7** *Turn.* In a moment the wicked is not to be found. C. 10:25 and Ps. 36:35.  
**8** *Learning.* We apply to those things which we love, and those who study sacred ( C.) or useful sciences, shall receive praise.  
**9** *Glorious.* Or a boaster, ( H.) as many noblemen are, who are involved in debt. Eccli. 10:30. M.—It is better to have a sufficiency, than to be of noble parentage; and starving through a stupid idea, that work would be disgraceful.  
**10** *Beasts.* Those who treat them with cruelty, would do the like with men. God gives regulations to let brute beasts have rest. Lev. 22:28. C. S. Chrys. in Rom. xxix.  
**11** *Idleness.* Heb. “the idle.” Their company is seducing.—*He that*, &c. This occurs in the Sept. but not in the Heb. or the new edit. of S. Jerom. C.—*Wine.* Or “in taverns.”—*Holds.* Soldiers have thus been often surprised. M.—“Drunkenness is an incitement to lust and madness, the poison of wisdom.” S. Amb.  
**12** *Men.* They wish to supplant one another.  
**13** *Lips.* Liars often become the victims of their own deceit.  
**16** *Wise.* It is more difficult to repress, than to avoid anger. S. Amb.—To dissemble, so as to seek an opportunity of revenge, is not commended.  
**17** *That.* Heb. “the truth announceth justice.” We easily give credit to an honest man. C.  
**18** *Promiseth.* Sept. “there are, who speaking, wound with the sword; but,” &c. Heb. bote ( H.) means also, making a foolish promise, which causes remorse. M.—This was the case with Herod, when he was pleased with Herodias. Matt. 14:8. C.—Heb. “speaketh like the piercings of the sword,” (Prot. H.) as detractors, and those who disseminate impious and scandalous maxims do.  
**19** *Frameth* *.* He studies how to escape detection. Heb. “a lying tongue is but for a moment;” it is presently discovered.  
**20** *Deceit.* Or uneasiness. C.—Honi soit qui mal y pense: “let him be covered with shame who thinks evil in it,” seems nearly the same import. H.  
**21** *Sad.* Even if he fall into sin, he will not lose all hope. C.—The accidents accompanying this life will not overwhelm him. S. Chrys.—Heb. “no evil shall befall the just.” If he be afflicted here, he will be amply rewarded hereafter. Sept. “the just will not be pleased with any injustice.”  
**23** *Cautious. Versutus* is taken in a good, as well as in a bad sense. The wise are reserved in speaking. Prov. 16:14. C.  
**25** *Grief.* Sept. “a fearful speech troubleth the heart of a (just) man.” Grabe. H.  
**26** *Just.* A true friend will make any sacrifice. C.—“I am convinced that friendship can subsist only among the good,” says Cicero. Heb. “the just hath more, ( C. Prot.) *or* is more excellent than his neighbour.” Sept. “the intelligent just is his own friend; (but the sentences of the impious are contrary to equity. Evils shall pursue sinners) but the way,” &c. Grabe. H.  
**27** *Gain.* Heb. and Sept. “his prey,” ( C.) or what “he took in hunting.” Prot. H.  
**28** *Bye-way.* Of vice. Heb. “and a way which leadeth to death,” or “its paths conduct to death.” C.

## Chapter 13

**1** *Doctrine.* Or he gives proof of his good education, ( C.) and excites even his father to advance in piety. Ven. Bede.—Sept. “is obedient to *his* father; but the disobedient son is in destruction.” H.  
**2** *Mouth.* In reward of his good speeches. C.—Sept. “of justice the good man eateth; but the souls of the lawless perish before the time.” C. 12:13.  
**3** *Hath.* Heb. “who openeth his lips *inconsiderately*, is lost. Judg. 11:35. H.  
**4** *Willeth not.* Heb. “hath not.” He only desires riches, or to be converted, and will not labour. C. 21:25. Eccli. 5:8.  
**5** *Confounded.* The detractor is like swine, stirring up dirt. S. Chrys. 32. ad Pop.—The liar is not believed, even when he speaks the truth. Aristot.  
**6** *Sinner.* Sym. “draweth on sin.” Virtue is the best safeguard.  
**7** *Riches.* Such was S. Paul. 2 Cor. 6:10. Some affect to be rich, while others are never satisfied. *Semper avarus eget* *.* Lazarus was very rich in God’s sight.  
**8** *Reprehension.* Or is not able to defend himself, like the rich. C.—He is not exposed so much to great revolutions. Bayn.  
**9** *Out.* They are hated as well as their offspring. C.  
**10** *Contentions.* As none will yield. M.—Heb. “only by pride cometh contention.” Prot.—“Pride is the mother of all sects.” S. Aug.  
**11** *Haste.* Heb. “by vanity,” and injustice. Those who become rich on a sudden fall under suspicion, as a Roman objected to Sylla, who had inherited nothing. Plut.—*By little.* Heb. “he that gathereth by labour, (Sept. piety) shall increase.” Prot. H.  
**12** *Hope.* Sept. “(the just shews mercy and lends) better is he who begins heartily to assist, than he who promises and leads to hope. For a bad (Grabe substitutes good) desire is a tree of life.”—*Soul.* Prot. “maketh the heart sick.” H.—The pain increases in proportion to our eager desire. Calvin maintains, that the souls of the blessed are not yet in heaven, but hope: and of course he would establish a sort of purgatory for them. H.  
**13** *Come.* To defend what he has asserted, or to pass for a liar. Heb. “shall be destroyed by it.” Mont. H.—Those who despise God’s order shall perish.—*Deceitful*, &c. This is not in Heb. nor in some of the Lat. edit. C.—Sept. “to the deceitful son nothing shall be good. But the ways of the wise servant shall prosper, and his paths shall be made straight.” C. 14:15. H.  
**14** *That.* Sept. “but the fool is slain in the snare.” H.  
**15** *Grace.* God assists those who strive to be well instructed. C.  
**17** *Of the.* Heb. “a wicked ambassador.” A king generally chooses people like himself. M.—Sept. have read melec. “A rash *king* shall,” &c.  
**18** *To him.* Heb. “destroy discipline,” so that the most wretched are often noted for immorality. Sept. “instruction takes away poverty,” as “the whole earth supports the man that has a trade,” τεχνιον, according to the Greek proverb. C.  
**19** *That is.* Sept. “of the pious, but the works of the impious are far from knowledge.” H.  
**20** *Become.* Sept. “be known.” A person’s disposition may be seen by the company which he frequents.  
**22** *Heirs.* This was more observable under the old law: yet we often seem the distress to which the unjust are exposed. *De male quæsitis non gaudet tertius hæres* *.* C.  
**23** *Fathers.* Heirs often lose their property by their misconduct. Heb. and ( H.) Chal. read, “of the poor,” who till their land better than those who have too large farms. M.—Nature requires but little. C.—Sept. “the just shall spend many years in affluence: but the unjust are cut off at once.” H.  
**24** *Betimes.* God has always treated his friends in this manner, to preserve them from sin, or to increase their reward. C.

## Chapter 14

**1** *House.* Giving her children a proper education, and taking care of her house. C. 12:4 and Tit. 2:5. C.  
**2** *And*, is not in Heb.—*Is.* Heb. “but the perverse in his ways despiseth him;” ( H.) shewing by his conduct that he cares not for the Lord. C.—Sept. “he shall be dishonoured, that,” &c.  
**3** *Pride.* He chastiseth with haughtiness, and is ever quarrelling.  
**4** *Empty.* As the land has not bee cultivated. H.—*Strength*, or number of oxen. C.—“The virtue of the preachers is manifested where there are many converted to produce fruit.” S. Greg. vii. ep. viii.  
**6** *Not.* Because they seek it ill, like the pagan sages. Sept. “thou shalt seek wisdom among the wicked, and shalt not find it,” &c.  
**7** *Prudence.* Thou wilt presently perceive his weakness. Heb. “abandon a,” &c. He is not capable of hearing reason: keep at a distance.  
**8** *Way.* This science of the saints is the only true wisdom.—*Erreth* *.* They are inconstant. Heb. “*is* deceit.” They are bent on it.  
**9** *Sin.* C. 10:23. Heb. “excuse sin,” ( C.) or “mock at sin,” ( H.) committed by others. M.—*Grace*, or good-will. They are agreeable to all. C.  
**10** *Stranger.* Such cannot well comfort the afflicted. A man is alone acquainted with the affections of his own heart. Sept. “he mixeth not insult” (Sym.) “with strangers.”  
**12** *Death.* How many, under the garb of piety, follow their passions! How many are misled by their singularity, or by unskilful directors! C.—We must suspect our own judgment. M.—If any Turks, Jews, or heretics, lead a moral good life, it seemeth both to themselves and to other ignorant people that they are in the right way to salvation; but their error in faith leadeth them to eternal damnation. W.—The persecutors thought they did God a service by putting the apostles to death. Will they be excused? H.  
**13** *Laughter.* Sept. “with his counsels,” enjoying the content of a good conscience, and a heavenly reward; while the wicked, with all his self-approbation, shall be punished.  
**14** *Above him*, Sept. “with content sorrow is not mixed.” H.—*Joy.* Such is the condition of earthly things. Pind. Pyth. viii.  
**15** *Innocent.* Good and unsuspecting; (Jos. 9:14 and 1 Cor. 13:7) or rather credulous. 1 Jo. 4:1. C.—Sept. “the man who is not bad.”—*Steps.* Sept. “repenteth.” H.—*No*, &c. This occurs (C. 13:13) in several copies: but here it is omitted in Heb. &c.  
**17** *Folly.* Wrath betrays us into great extravagances.—*Hateful.* Heb. also, “hateth” folly. Sept. “the prudent beareth much.” Job 5:2. C.  
**20** *Many.* “Riches make friends, poverty tries them.” Syrus.—False friends resemble swallows, which retire at the approach of winter. Cic. ad Heren. iv.  
**21** *He … mercy*, is not found in Heb. Greek, or Lat. MSS. C.  
**22** *Truth.* Those who are kind and faithful. H. C. 3:3.—Sept. add, ( C.) as a second version, (Grabe) “the workers of evils understand not mercy and truth: but kind and faithful actions are with those who do good.”  
**24** *Imprudence.* This they always betray, while the wise use their riches to assist their fellow-creatures, and receive a crown of glory. H.  
**28** *King.* Who formerly was styled “a shepherd,” to remind him of the care with which he ought to seek the welfare of his subjects. C.  
**30** *Bones.* As a sound heart preserves the rest of the body, so a good intention often excuses from mortal sin, when the error is not gross. But envy corrupts the works which seem good, and which cannot bear a strict examination. S. Greg. Mor. v. 34. W.—Envy ruins the health. Menan. ap. Grot.—Sept. “a *too* sensible heart *is* the,” &c. This is beautiful; but not quite conformable to the Heb.  
**31** *Him.* God takes the poor under his special protection, (Matt. 25:40) and is the distributor of all riches. What would the rich do without the poor? C.  
**33** *And.* Prot. “but *that which is* in the midst of fools is made known.” H.—A vessel full of gold makes no noise, while that which contains only a few pieces sounds much. Munster. Corn. a Lap.—Thus the fool makes a parade of all that he knows. C.—Sept. “but in the heart of fools, it is not known.” H.—Aquila and Theodotion have the negation, ( C.) as well as the Syr. and Arab. See c. 5:16. Kennicott.  
**34** *Miserable.* This sentence ought to be engraven in all public places. Heb. “and mercy the sinful people,” whom God spares on account of their alms-deeds, (Dan. 4:24) or “sin is the shame of peoples.” C.—Montanus renders chesed mercy, and Pagnin “ignominy.” The former is scarcely intelligible, *et misericordia populorum peccatum*, unless sin be here taken for a *sin-offering*, ( H.) as it is by Vatab. Grot. &c. C.  
**35** *Nothing.* Lit. “useless,” which often means bad. H.—A servant who does not discharge his duty is such. Heb. “he that causeth to blush,” and has no economy. C.—Sept. “He removes shame by his good management. Anger destroys the prudent; but a mild,” &c. H.

## Chapter 15

**1** *Fury.* This was seen in Nabal and Roboam, while Gideon and Abigail shewed the good effects of a mild answer. Jud. 8:1 and 1 K. 10:25 and 3 K. 12:11.  
**2** *Knowledge.* It requires to be proposed in a proper manner.  
**4** *Life.* This comparison was become proverbial for something very excellent. *Immoderate.* Heb. “perverse.” C.—Evil discourse kills the souls both of those who speak, and of those who pay attention to it. H.  
**5** *In abundant*, &c. Is omitted in Heb. Chal. and many Greek and Latin copies. The same idea is expressed in the following verse.  
**7** *Unlike.* The wise, or themselves. Heb. and Sept. “inconstant.”  
**8** *Wicked.* Still unconverted. Eccli. 34:23. When they repent, and offer sacrifice with sincerity, they will obtain mercy. The Donatists abused this text, to prove that baptism conferred by wicked ministers was unavailing. But S. Aug. shewed them, that Christ was the principal agent, and conferred grace, even though the minister might draw down judgments on his own head. Con. Parm. ii. 6.—Even pagans confessed, that sacrifices, without virtue, could afford no benefit. “God was more pleased with the prayers of the Lacedemonians, than with all the sacrifices of the Greeks,” say the idolatrous priests in Plato, Alcib. ii. Seneca de Ben. i. 5.  
**10** *Instruction.* Heb. “a heavy punishment.” H.—The mind which gives way to vice, must have embraced some false doctrine.  
**11** *Before.* Naked. The state of the damned is known to God. C. 9:18. C.  
**13** *Down.* Compunction is salutary, but worldly grief blameable. C. 25:20 and 2 Cor. 7:10. S. Greg. past. ii. 10.  
**15** *Feast.* Those who repine at their condition are miserable; while the poor may be delivered from many cares. C.—  
**16** *Content.* Sept. “fear.” Heb. “with trouble,” which is preferable. 1 Tim. 6:6.  
**17** *Calf.* Or feast after sacrifice. 1 K. 17:19. Lu. 15:23.  
**19** *Thorns.* All seems to them impossible. C.—In agriculture, however, ( H.) “in domestic affairs, negligence is attended with more labour than diligence.” Colum. 12:2.  
**21** *Fool.* He thinks himself the most happy of mortals. C.—Sept. “the ways of the fools are senseless.” H.  
**22** *Counsel.* Heb. “secrecy.”—*Established.* We put in execution without fear, what has been resolved maturely. C.  
**24** *Above.* Lit. “upon the learned.” H.—One path leads to the realms above. C.—The wise must be intent on God. M.  
**26** *Shall by*, &c. is not added in Heb. &c. nor in several Latin MSS.  
**27** *Troubleth* *.* With all sorts of temporal misfortunes. A judge who receives bribes, is accursed. Ex. 23:8.—*By*, &c. is not here in Heb. but c. 16:6. S. Cyprian (3 Test.) found it in his copy.—*Faith*, or fidelity and *truth*, as it is elsewhere expressed. C. 3:3. These virtues move God to pardon.  
**28** *Studieth* *.* And speaks deliberately. Sept. Rom. is more embarrassed in the rest of this, and the nine first verses of the following chapter, than the Complut. edition.  
**30** *Fat.* And contributes to health. By less noble motives, the mind is gradually raised to the more excellent.  
**33** *Lesson.* Or “what teacheth.” *Humility*, or docility, as those who acknowledge no master will never be wise. Matt. 23:12. C.

## Chapter 16

**1** *It is the part of man*, &c. That is, a man should prepare in his heart and soul what he is to say; but after all, it must be the Lord that must govern his tongue, to speak to the purpose. Not that we can think any thing of good without God’s grace: but after that we have (with God’s grace) thought and prepared within our souls what we would speak; if God does not govern our tongue, we shall not succeed in what we speak. Ch.—He well put into our mouths what we have to say to persecutors. Lu. 21:14. He often causes us to utter the reverse of what we intended, as Balaam did. Num. 23. M.—The fairest prospects miscarry without God’s blessing. The enemies of grace would infer from this text, that the beginning of salvation depends on free-will. But S. Aug. (con. 2. epist. Pelag. ii. 8.) has solidly refuted them, and Solomon does not mean that man acts alone. C. 8:35. Sept. Jo. 15:5 and 2 Cor. 3:5. “Man,” says S. Aug. “does no good things, which God does not cause him to perform.” C.—The Scripture cannot contradict itself. A fresh grace is requisite to execute what God has enabled us to devise, v. 9. W.  
**2** *Open.* Or approved. M.—Heb. “pure in his own eyes.” He sees not his own defects. C. 21:2. Job 28:23. C.  
**3** *Open.* Heb. “roll on,” and refer all to God’s glory. M. Ps. 36:5.  
**4** *Day.* His obduracy is of his own choice, and must serve to set the divine justice in the clearest light. Eccli. 32:14. Ex. 9:16. Others hence infer that predestination is gratuitous, and reprobation in consequence of sin. It seems rather that temporal goods and evils are here meant. C.  
**5** *Hand.* And he seems to be very quiet. C. 11:21. Sept. “but he who putteth his hand in hands unjustly, *to make a contract*, is,” &c.—*The*, &c. is taken from the Rom. Sept. and occurs before. C. 15:27.  
**6** *Mercy* to the distressed. C. 3:3 and 14:22.  
**7** *Peace.* Thus Jacob, Joseph, Daniel, &c. were admired by their former enemies.  
**10** *Judgment.* Or “let it not err,” as people look upon the decisions of kings as so many oracles. We ought to act in this manner, as long as they are not visibly unjust. God gave a *principal spirit* (Ps. 50:14) to Saul, David, Solomon, and to the judges whom he appointed, 1 K. 10:9. Deut. 34:9. Judg. 3:10. C.—Solomon was thus enabled to decide difficult cases. M. Job 29:7.  
**11** *Bag.* Many read *sæculi*, “of the world.” So Ven. Bede, &c. All God’s appointments are perfectly just. C. 11:21. It was the custom for people to carry balances to weigh money, before it was coined. C.  
**13** *Loved.* Yet none are more exposed to flattery and deceit than kings. Senec. ep. xxi.  
**15** *Life.* A mild government resembles a serene sky. Sen. Clem. Job 29:23.  
**16** *Get.* Sept. “the nests of wisdom … and the nests of prudence;” or Churches of Christ, or places of education, may be intended. C.  
**18** *Fall.* Our first parents had given way to pride, before they sinned publicly. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. xiv. 13.  
**21** *Shall.* Heb. “adds learning,” both to himself and to others. Those who are wise and eloquent, must be preferred before those who have only the former qualification. C.  
**23** *Heart.* Or knowledge. H.—Wisdom gives beauty to eloquence.  
**26** *Mouth.* The want of food. Eccle. 6:7.  
**27** *Diggeth* *.* Earnestly pursues.—*Fire.* Jam. 3:16. C.  
**28** *Words.* Prot. “a whisperer separateth chief friends.”  
**30** *Lips.* These motions indicate fury and pensiveness.  
**31** *Justice.* To the just longevity is promised. C.  
**32** *Valiant.* Sept. Alex. adds, “and a prudent man than a great farmer.” Γεωργιου. H.—*Cities.* To govern the passions is more difficult. S. Greg. Past. iii. p. Adm. x. S. Tho. ii. 2. q. 128. a. 6.  
**33** *Lord.* So the apostles had recourse to them, (Acts 1:26) as the Cophts and Nestorians still do when there is a dispute about the election of a patriarch. Renaudot iv. Perpet. i. 7. and 9.—This mode may settle disputes. C. 18:18. But we must not have recourse to it, except where the Church permits, lest we become the dupes of an idle curiosity. C.—Nothing happens by chance. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. v. 9.—Sept. “all things come into the breast of the unjust; but all just things proceed from the Lord.” H.

## Chapter 17

**1** *Victims.* Of which part was used for a feast. C. 7:14. C.—Sept. add, “of many goods, and unjust victims.” H.  
**2** *Brethren.* Partaking with them, (Abenezra. T. M.) or rather acting as his master’s executor; which evinces the advantages of wisdom, so as to raise a slave above those whom his station requires him to serve. Such was Joseph, who was *tried.*  
**4** *Lips.* They mutually deceive one another, as well as others.  
**6** *Fathers.* Whose virtues they are bound to imitate.  
**7** *Eloquent.* Sept. “faithful.” They cannot be expected from them.  
**8** *Expecteth* heavenly things. Sept. “instruction is the reward of good deeds to those who use it.”  
**9** *Friends.* Detractors cause dissensions, and even wars.  
**10** *Fools.* “A word is enough for the wise.” *Nobilis equus* *umbra virgæ regitur, ignavus ne calcari quidem* *.* Q. Curt.  
**11** *Angel.* Messenger of death, ( M.) which is sometimes inflicted by good, at others by bad, angels of death, or satan. 2 Cor. 12:7. Ps. 77:49.  
**12** *Fool.* Heb. “fool in his folly.” The danger is not greater in meeting ( C.) a female bear, though it be the most terrible. Arist. Anim. ix. 1.  
**14** *Water.* It is scarcely possible to prevent the bad effects of detraction. Frequent quarrels have also risen on account of springs. Gen. 26:20.—*Judgment.* And gives up the cause, as being much more prudent. Mat. 5:25. 40.  
**15** *God.* We ought to suspend our judgment, or incline to the more favourable side. Matt. 7:1. Rom. 2:1.  
**16** *He*, &c. is not here in Heb. though it be equivalently (v. 19) where the Sept. are silent. C.  
**17** *Distress.* Like the real friend. C. 18:24.  
**18** *Hands.* Through joy, or as a mark of his consent.  
**19** *Door.* Sixtus V. reads, “mouth:” as some explain the *door* to mean. A large door supposes that the house is elevated, and thus exposed to danger from winds, &c.  
**24** *Earth.* Wandering and insatiable, and deeming the acquisition of wisdom too difficult.  
**26** *No good.* But very criminal. See Jer. 7:31.  
**27** *Precious* and reserved *spirit.* This is a mark of wisdom. C.  

---

## Chapter 18

**1** *Reproach.* True friendship resembles charity, and bears all things. 1 Cor. 13:4. Heb. now reads Thave, “desire;” instead of *Thuane, occasion*, or “pretext,” which must have been in the copies of the Sept. and Vulg. C.—Prot. “through desire, a man having separated himself, seeketh *and* intermeddleth with all wisdom.” The solitary seeks heaven. H.  
**2** *Heart.* Conformable to his passions. C.—Heb. “unless to lay open his heart.” He wishes to appear wise, and to justify his wicked designs. H.  
**3** *Contemneth* both God and man. Lu. 18:4. Heb. “is contemned” in his turn. C.—He is like a man abandoned by the physician. Op. Imp. in Matt. Hom. 40.  
**4** *Man*, who is just and wise. His advice deserves attention. C. 20:5.  
**6** *Quarrels.* Heb. “blows.” Sept. “death;” (v. 7) which are the usual consequences of quarrels.  
**8** *Tongued.* Heb. “caluminator.” He pretends to wish well to those of whom he speaks, or else to guard the company against deceit. C.—“If the devil be upon the detractor’s tongue, he is in the ears of those who pay attention to him.” S. Fran. de Sales.—*Fear*, &c. is in the Sept. above. The Vulg. retains both this and the new version of S. Jerom.  
**9** *Brother.* Like him, as both end in poverty. C. 10:4 and 12:11.  
**10** *Name.* Essence, or protection of God. The *rich* depends on his own wealth.  
**13** *Heareth* the end of the question. C. 1:5.  
**14** *Infirmity* of the flesh. Matt. 26:41.—*That is.* Theodot. “is wounded, who shall support?”  
**16** *Princes.* He easily finds access by showing submission. C.  
**17** *Him.* To see that he act with sincerity.  
**18** Lot*.* C. 16:33. Sept. “silence.” C.—But Grabe substitutes “lot.” H.  
**19** *Judgments* of many are more deserving of credit. Heb. “a brother offended, is like a strong place, and *their* quarrels,” &c. The are not easily reconciled. Civil wars are most terrible. C.  
**20** *Satisfied.* Those who are guarded in their words get employment. H. C. 12:14.  
**21** *Love it*, and speak well or ill, shall receive accordingly. Matt. 12:37.  
**22** *Good wife. Good* is not in Heb. but should be understood, as it is expressed in Sept. of Complut. ( C.) and Alex. H.—*He that*, &c. occurs not in Heb. Sixtus V. &c. But it is found in Sept. and Arabic. The Syriac omits the last sentence.—*Wicked.* S. Aug. had frequently asserted that a divorce was only of counsel: but this he retracted, when he reflected on this text. Ret. i. 19.—The Hebrews, Athenians, and Romans, followed the same practice with adulteresses. Selden, Ux. iii. 16. Dem. in Neæram, &c.—Hermas (past. i. 4.) prescribes that the penitent shall be received again, but not often. In cae of divorce, the fathers still permit not a second marriage, that the parties may be reconciled. They enjoin the husband to put away only such as are incorrigible. S. Aug. Adul. ii. 3. C.  
**24** *Brother.* The ties of nature are not so strong as those of friendship. C.—Heb. “a man *that hath* friends must shew himself friendly; and there is a friend *that* sticketh closer than a brother.” Prot. H.—*Ut ameris ama* *.* Mart.

## Chapter 19

**1** *Rich*, is not in Heb. Sept. Compl. or S. Jerom. C.—But as there is not antithesis between a poor man and a fool, it ought to be inserted, as it is in the Syriac, which reads, “than he who is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.” The MS. 2 confirms “ways.” Kennicott.  
**2** *Soul.* Wholesome and spiritual. Heb. “the soul *or* life is not good.”—*Stumble.* “The more I make haste, the less I advance,” said Plato; (Rep. 7.) and Augustus often repeated; *Sat cito, si sat benè* *.* Sueton.  
**3** *Fretteth.* Lit. “burneth.” Sept. “blameth.” Heb. “his heart rageth against the Lord.” H.—Thus Adam tacitly laid the blame on him, as all those who excuse themselves on account of their temper, habits, stars, the violence of temptation, &c. C.  
**7** *Only.* Heb. has lo, and the marg. lu, with the Vulg. C.—The former word intimates that the words have *no* solidity, and the latter that they shall be *his* only portion who is so foolish as to trust in them. *Sequens dicta non ispa* *;* (Mont.) or *e* *i ipsa*, if we follow the margin. H.  
**8** *Mind.* Heb. “heart,” intelligence. C. 15:32.—*Loveth.* This does not contradict the gospel; (Jo. 12:25) as those who refrain from what the soul would crave to its own detriment, truly love it.  
**10** *Fool.* He would eat them, so as to prejudice his health.—*Princes.* C. 30:21. Such are commonly insolent, and should attend to Ausonius. *Fortunam reverenter hab* *e* *.*  
**11** *Wrongs.* The wise man is not vindictive or punctilious.  
**12** *Anger.* Is not their dominion enough? Having none to admonish them, they do not perceive their excesses.  
**13** *Through.* It cannot be endured long. C.—*Dos est uxoria lites* *.* Ovid. Art. 1.—“Quarrels are a wife’s dowry.”  
**14** *Properly.* Sept. “fitted by.” H.—Hence the Fathers dissuade marrying with infidels. S. Amb. in Lu. xvi.—All good comes from God.  
**15** *Hunger.* Both temporal and eternal. C.—*Non progredi, regredi est* *.* S. Bernard says, “Not to advance, is to go back.”  
**16** *Neglecteth.* Heb. “contemneth.” In the law of Moses, many transgressions are punished with death, but here that of the soul is meant. C.  
**17** *Lendeth.* To receive interest, *fœneratur* *.* H.—Such usury is lawful, and God will abundantly reward acts of mercy. C.—He engages his word for the poor. S. Aug. in Ps. xxxvi.  
**18** *Killing.* Prot. “crying;” or by his complaint be not deterred. H.—Chal. agrees with us. The law permitted parents to sell their children, and to have them stoned to death, if they declared them disobedient, (Deut. 21:18. C.) and riotous, v. 20. Timely chastisement may prevent such extremities. H.—S. Paul dissuades unnecessary severity. Col. 3:21.  
**19** *Thing.* A child neglected will continue to steal, or to offend; ( C.) while too much harshness will do no good, but tend to the *damage* of all parties. H.—Anger is productive of the worst effects.  
**21** *Firm.* Ignorance and weakness cause men to change.  
**22** *Merciful.* Heb. 2:17. *Non ignara mali miseris succurrere disco* *.* Æn. 4.—Heb. “the desire of a man is his mercy,” (Mont. H.) or “shame,” (R. Levi) as it leads to sin. Gen. 6:5. All wish to be esteemed merciful.—*Man* of quality. Heb. meish, “prœ viro.” Mont.—“Rich man.” Sept. H.  
**23** *Life.* Both temporal and eternal. C. 10:27. C.—*With evil.* Lit. “the worst,” *pessima* *.* H.—Sixtus V. “by the most wicked one.” The devil shall have no power over him.  
**24** *Arm-pit.* Or Heb. tsallachath, “in the pot,” out of which he eats; which shews his negligence.—*Mouth*, to eat. This hyperbole indicates that he is too lazy to take the necessary sustenance. C. 26:15. C.—Sept. “in his breast unjustly. Neither will he bring them to his mouth.” H.—He will bestow nothing, and shall reap no benefit from his avarice. S. Bern.—He will not practise what he teaches. S. Greg. Mor. xii. 10.  
**25** *Wicked.* Heb. “scoffer.” Chastisements have always some good effect either on the sufferer, or on the spectators, who will be cautioned not to imitate what is wrong.  
**26** *Infamous.* Heb. “a son of confusion and reproach;” a spendthrift.  
**27** *Not.* Heb. seems to say the reverse. C.—But we may read it with an interrogation. “Wilt thou cease?” &c. Or the *instruction* here meant is of a dangerous nature. Prot. “*that causeth* to err from the words of knowledge.” Sept. “a son who neglects to keep the instruction of his father, shall muse on bad sayings.” H.  
**29** *Hammers*, (Sym.) “punishments.” Sept. See Judg. 5:25. C.  

---

## Chapter 20

**1** *A luxurious thing.* Heb. “a scoffer.” Chal. “renders one a scoffer.”—*Drunkenness.* Heb. ssocor, any strong drink, particularly palm-wine. Intemperance places the strongest obstacles in the way of wisdom. It causes a person to mock at all sacred things, and to be quarrelsome. C. 23:29. Eph. 5:18.  
**3** *Reproaches.* It is better not to commence a lawsuit, even when we are in the right. C. 17:11. C.—*Plena victoria est ad clamantem tacere* *.* Val. Max.  
**5** *Out.* So David discovered the meaning of the Thecuite, 2 K. 14:18. A wise politician carefully examines everything in a foreign court.  
**6** *Faithful.* Few continue steady to their engagements or friends, whom they will assist to a certain point. In God these two virtues always go together. Ps. 84:11. But they are rarely found in men. C.  
**8** *Look.* It is the duty of kings to administer justice.  
**9** *Sin.* Prot. “my sin?” We know not when it is remitted. H.—Without a special revelation, no one can be secure, 1 Jo. 1:8. Eccle. 9:1. Bayn. S. Aug. in Ps. cxlix.  
**10** *Measures.* In commerce, ( C.) as well as in judging. S. Greg. in Ezec. 4.  
**11** *Right.* We may form some judgment of his future conduct, from the inclinations which he manifests in his infancy.  
**12** *Both.* Consequently he will know all our actions. Ps. 93:9. We must refer all to him, as he gives us the means of learning. C.  
**13** *Sleep.* Sept. “back-biting, that thou mayst not be taken off.” H.  
**14** *Buyer.* This is the common practice; yet it is not without exceptions. S. Aug. (Trin. xiii. 3.) observes, that the mountebank having promised to tell what every person had in his heart, many came to the theatre, when he told them that they all wished to by cheap, and to sell dear. They all applauded the remark. C.—Sept. is here defective. H.  
**16** *Strangers.* For whom he has bound himself foolishly. C. 6:1. All who have the care of others, must answer for them. C.  
**17** *Lying.* Deceit, and unlawful pleasures. C. 9:17. But God mingles disgust with them, and will punish the guilty, at least hereafter. Worldly enjoyments seem sweet, but they are full of *gravel*, and hurtful.  
**18** *Governments.* Or prudence, else the best designs may prove abortive.  
**19** *Lips.* And speaketh much. These people are unworthy of our friendship.  
**20** **V** **er.** **20** **.** *Lamp.* Prosperity, or children.  
**21** *Blessing.* It is morally impossible that they should have been acquired justly. C. 13:11 and 21:5.  
**22** *Evil.* And revenge myself. This belongs to the Lord. Deut. 32:35. Man would be too favourable to himself, and would also pronounce his own condemnation, as he is also a sinner.  
**24** *Way?* Jer. 10:23. Independently of God, who can do any good? C.  
**25** *Ones.* Heb. “the saint *or* holy thing.” H.—Chal. “to make a vow for the sanctuary, and afterwards repent;” having acted inconsiderately at first. To attack the persons or relics of the saints, or to plunder what is consecrated to pious uses, will bring on destruction; so also to make vows, and then seek to evade them, will not pass unpunished. C.  
**26** *Wheel.* Or triumphal arch, *fornic* *em* *.* Ven. Bede. Jans.—He will make his enemies lie prostrate under his chariot-wheels, 2 K. 12:31.  
**27** *Lamp.* The breath of life, (Gen. 2:7) and the light of man. 1 Cor. 2:11.  
**28** *Clemency.* Such a king need not fear rebellion. C.  
**29** *Hairs*, and experience. They have a greater contempt of death and pleasures. S. Amb. Hex. i. 8.  
**30** *Evils.* The wicked shall derive benefit from correction.—*Belly.* They shall feel the remorse of conscience, as Chal. seems to indicate. C.—A serious illness often causes people to repent. M.

## Chapter 21

**1** *It.* Though it be free, and may resist grace or embrace virtue. Is. 45:22. Jer. 3:14 and 7:3. Jos. 24:23. C.—Yet God knows how to turn the heart even of a king, so as to preserve his liberty, with the same ease as a gardener brings the streams of water to his plants. M.  
**3** *Mercy.* Sept. “justice and truth.” H. See Os. 6:6. M.  
**4** *Heart.* Or when it is proud, it causes the eyes to appear so too. C.—*Lamp.* Prot. “ploughing of the wicked *is* sin.” When it is done with a bad motive, out of pride. Heb. “the haughtiness of the eyes, and the enlarging of the heart, *are* the labour (“*tillage.*” Mont. “*thought.*” Pagn.) of the wicked; *yea*, sin.” H.—Those things are their employment, and their sin. C.—Sept. and Vulg. may also mean, “sin is the lamp *and exultation* of the wicked.” H.  
**5** *Sluggard.* Heb. “hasty man,” as the slothful is ironically styled. He would see his desires accomplished without labouring; and will never stick to work. This levity is most injurious to his advancement.  
**6** *Death.* Their injustice shall be punished.  
**8** *Strange.* Unknown, impure way. Lev. 10:1. Deut. 17:15. C.  
**9** *Top*, (*domatis*) as the roofs in Palestine were flat. S. Jer. ad Sun.—Any inconvenience had better be endured, than to live with the quarrelsome. M.  
**10** *Neighbour.* Sym. “he has no idea of friendship.” Sept. “he shall not be treated with mercy by any man.” H.  
**11** *Knowledge.* These are the effects of chastisements and good company.  
**12** *Evil.* He tries every expedient to save him.—*That.* Sept. “he despises.” Sym. “throws down.”  
**14** *Bosom.* In private. C.—They put all valuable things in the bosom. H.  
**15** *To do judgment.* Or to see it done, while the wicked depend only on the corruption of their judges.  
**16** *Giants*, in hell. C. 15:11. Job 26:5. Ezec. 22:21.  
**17** *Rich.* Economy is constantly recommended. C.—Those who squandered away their goods, were fined by the Areopagites. Athen. iv. 19.  
**18** *Righteous.* Many are deterred from wickedness by the punishment of malefactors, whose injuries are frequently irreparable. God abandoned Pharao and Aman to save his people. He treated them as victims of wrath. Is. 43:3.  
**20** *Trea* *sure* of provisions. Temporal blessings were promised as a figure of more lasting ones, which are set before Christians.  
**22** *Thereof.* Nothing can resist. Matt. 12:29. Eccle. 9:16. C.  
**23** *Mout* *h*, from eating too much. Lyran.  
**24** *Ignorant.* Heb. “a scoffer.” Sept. “pestilent.” H.—Such a one is always actuated by pride, when he attempts to turn good advice and religion to ridicule.  
**25** **5** **.** *At all.* Hence his desires of riches and wisdom prove fruitless. C. 13:4.  
**27** *Wickedness.* Heb. “with an evil thought.” Mont. Eccli. 34:24. H.  
**28** *Obedient.* Attentive, faithful witness, shall speak with triumph, or he who obeys the law, shall gain the victory over the devil, &c. Phil. 2:8.  
**29** *Face.* Never blushing, or yielding to good advice.  
**31** *Battle.* It was kept for no other purpose by the eastern nations, who used oxen to till the land; asses and camels to carry burdens. Job 39:18. Ps. 19:8 and 32:17. C.  

---

## Chapter 22

**1** *Good.* Heb. “a name,” or reputation. H.—It is preferable to riches, but not to be compared with virtue, which is the only solid good; and even to be placed above *riches*, it must be well grounded. C.—*Favour* with all. H.  
**2** *Another.* They stand in need of one another. S. Chrys. hom. xxxiv. in 1 Cor.—They are equal in God’s sight, who only values real virtue. He disposes of riches, so that the poor may one day become rich. C.  
**4** *Fruit.* Lit. “the end of modesty, ( H.) or moderation, which must accompany every virtue.  
**5** *Perverse.* They are always in danger and in trouble.  
**6** *It is a proverb*, is added by S. Jerom, to make the sentence more striking.—*It.* He is like a tender plant, ( C.) or wax, or a new vessel.  
**7** *Servant.* He might be sold, &c. Ex. 22:3. Matt. 18:25. Gell. xx. 1. Plato (Leg. viii.) would have nothing sold on credit. These laws appear to be severe; but they are founded on wisdom, as nothing impoverishes more than the facility of borrowing.  
**8** *Consumed.* Or beaten with the flail of God’s anger.  
**9** *Is.* Heb. “has a good eye,” in opposition to the *evil*, or malicious one. Matt. 20:15.—*He*, &c. is not in Heb. or in the Lat. edit. of Comp. and S. Jer.  
**11** *He.* Sept. “the Lord loveth pious hearts. All the irreproachable are acceptable to him. The king feeds with lips,” by his just ordinances. H.—Kings hate duplicity; but require that the truth should be disclosed to them in a suitable manner.  
**13** *Streets.* Vain excuses of sloth!  
**14** *It.* Debauchery resembles hell. C. 23:23. C.—*Facilis descensus Averni*, &c. Æn. vi.  
**15** *Folly.* Ignorance and innate corruption are corrected by a good education.  
**17** *Incline.* Thus Solomon concludes his discourse, (c. 24:23) in the same manner as he began it, to chap. 10. Some commence the third book of Proverbs in this place; others, c. 25. C.  
**18** *Lips.* Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.  
**20** *Ways.* Repeatedly. Boss. T. 2 Cor. 12:8. Amos 1:11. C.—Prot. “have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge?” “Shalishim,” perfect, (Pagn.) or “three things,” (Mont.) means also ( H.) such as might suit princes and great officers. C.  
**21** *Sent.* Sept. “are sent to thee.” Thou mayst become a teacher, ( H.) or give satisfaction to thy parents, who have sent thee to my school. C.  
**22** *Gate.* Where judges passed sentence. M.  
**25** *Soul.* By imitating him, or by falling a victim to his rage.  
**26** *Hands.* Engaging to stand bond. H. c. 6:1.—Such a one might be required to pay the debt. C. 20:16.  
**28** *Set.* The pagans made a god of *Terminus*, to prevent disputes. Ovid. Fast. ii.—If it be unlawful to disturb land-marks, how much more so is it to give way to novelty in religion? Deut. 19:14. C.—Solomon is addressing those who follow the true faith. Else the conduct of infidel ancestors should not deter any from embracing the truth. H.  
**29** *Obscure.* By industry he shall raise himself to notice. H.—Kings employ those who are most active. C.

## Chapter 23

**1** *Sit.* Saul sat at table, and the custom of lying down was adopted only a little while before the captivity. It was recent among the Romans. C.—*Soliti patres considere mensis* *.* Æn. vii. 170.  
**2** *Throat.* Restrain intemperance and talkativeness. Eccli. 31:12. Sept. “stretch forth thy hand, knowing that thou must prepare the like; but if thou be more insatiable, (3.) desire not his meats, for he has them of deceitful life.” They cannot afford real happiness, ( H.) and to vie with the rich would only reduce them to poverty. Eccli. 13:2. S. Aug. (tr. xlvii. in Joan.) explains this text of the blessed Eucharist, observing, that we must give our life for our brethren, as Christ did for us. Before communion, we must slay the old man, and subdue our passions. C.—*Power.* Prot. “if thou be a man given to appetite.” The situation of a courtier is very critical. H.—Those who eat with the kings of Persia, were nicely observed by an eunuch, lest they should cast their eyes on any of his concubines. Lucian. de Merced.  
**3** *Deceit.* Poison. He wishes to discover thy secret.  
**4** *Prudence.* Be more solicitous for this, than to acquire riches. C.—Yet this wisdom must be sober. Rom. 12:3. 1 Tim. 6:9. Sept. “being poor, do not stretch forth thyself to the rich, but prudently retire. v. 2. H.  
**5** *Riches.* Sept. “to him, *the rich man*, he no where appears. He has prepared,” &c. H.—*Like.* Heb. “as the eagle, *it* will fly,” &c. H.—We must therefore fix our hearts on more durable goods.  
**6** *Man.* Heb. “eat not bread of an evil eye,” the envious, or rather the sordid miser.  
**7** *Like.* Prot. “as he thinketh is his heart, so is he: eat,” &c. H.—He is still convinced that his guests will ruin him: or “like one guarding, *or* trembling for his soul.” Sept. “swallowing a hair, he saith,” &c. He is afraid of expense, and would allow himself as little as possible.—*Diviner.* Such endeavour to speak what may come to pass, but are full of anxiety; so the miser’s words are contrary to his real sentiments, ( C.) as the diviner knows that he is imposing on mankind. H.  
**8** *Words.* Thou wilt be disgusted, and repine. Eccli. 31:25.  
**10** *Ones.* Heb. and Sept. “ancient boundaries.”  
**11** *Kinsman.* Heb. Gaal, “tutor, defendant, *or* redeemer,” the Lord ( H.) himself. Lev. 25:25.  
**16** *Reins.* Inmost affections.  
**18** *Thou.* Prot. “surely there is an end.” Marg. “reward.” H.—The testimony of a good conscience affords the greatest comfort in death. Sept. “if thou observe these things, thou shalt have posterity.” Heb. “hopes.”  
**20** *Eat.* Such feasts tend to corrupt the morals, and to misspend time.  
**21** *Rags.* At death the insolent shall be exposed to shame.  
**23** *Sell.* Acquire as much wisdom as possible, and keep it with care. C.—Sept. “do not drive wisdom from thee.”  
**27** *Pit.* It is difficult to overcome this passion, when once it has got possession of the *heart.* We must therefore watch over it, and consecrate it in variably to wisdom. v. 26.  
**28** **Ver** **.** **28** **.** *Him.* Prot. “increaseth the transgressors among men,” ( H.) and like a harpy, kills all whom she can entrap.  
**29** *Whose father.* S. Jerom has read *ab avi*, instead of *abo*, ( C.) which is an interjection, (Boch.) alas! or it means, “trouble.” Sept. “drunkenness,” (Chal. C.) or “sorrow.” Prot.—*Falls.* Sept. “hath sorrows.” Heb. “babbling,” (Prot. H.) or discontents of mind. C.—*Cause.* Drunkards often fall upon their best friends, as Alexander did on Clytus. M.  
**31** *Yellow.* Or bright, as it is said there is only one red wine in Palestine.—*Pleasantly.* Heb. “it goeth right,” and is excellent. C.  
**32** Basilisk, (*regulus*). Heb. Tsiphoni, ( H.) as asp. Cerastes, &c. Ps. 90:13.  
**33** *Women.* Wine excites to lust. C. See c. 20:1.—*Shall.* Sept. “shall these.” H.  
**34** *When.* Sept. “in a great wave.” Never is reason more wanted, nor less able to perform her duty.  
**35** *Drew.* Chal. “plundered.” Sept. “mocked at me.”—*Again.* This is the woeful effect of drunkenness, that men are not deterred from it, though they be sensible of its dreadful consequences. M.

## Chapter 24

**1** *Like.* Be not allured by their prosperity to imitate them. Ps. 36:1.  
**3** *Wisdom* and virtue, and not by injustice can the house be established.  
**5** *Valiant*, as well as a good economist. v. 4. C.  
**6** *Counsels.* “Consult many what ought to be done, but only a few of the most faithful, or rather thyself alone, what thou art about to do.” Veget. 3:9 and 27.  
**7** *High.* Thus the fool excuses himself. But wisdom condescends to our weakness, if we be truly in earnest. Deut. 32:12. *Mouth.* To defend himself, or to give advice. C.  
**9** *Of a fool.* In as much as he is wicked. Though he may have some pious thoughts, he attends not to them. H.—He thinks how he may commit evil, and renders himself hateful. C.—Heb. “a wicked thought *is* the sin of folly.” Sept. “the fool dieth in sins.”—*Detractor.* Heb. “scoffer.” H.  
**10** *Diminished.* This is the sad consequences of too much dejection. Eph. 4:19. Despairing, they abandon themselves to impurities. H.  
**11** *Deliver.* The Jews often put people to death without any formal trial, pretending *zeal*, as they did S. Stephen, &c. Our Saviour rescued the adulteress from such a situation, as Daniel had done Susanna. Yet this text may regard poor debtors. Ps. 71:4. C.—Christian bishops used all their influence to preserve the lives of those who did not deserve death. S. Amb. in Ps. 118. Ser. viii. Off. i. 36. and ep. xxv. and xxvi.  
**12** *I have.* Heb. “behold, we know not this man.” Pagn. H.—He is a stranger. But all mankind are brethren, and have a charge to assist one another, even though they be enemies. Eccli. 17:12. Ex. 23:4. C.—*Keeper.* Heb. notser, “preserver.” As thou hast received many good things from God, shew mercy to thy neighbour.  
**13** *Honey.* Of wisdom, which is most delicious. M.  
**14** *Thou* *shalt.* Heb. “yea, it is the last.” Mont.—“Then there shall be a reward.” Prot.—Thou shalt enjoy old age, or have posterity. C.  
**16** *Fall* into smaller sins, (S. Greg. vi. in 2 Reg. xv. &c.) or into disgrace, as yippol ( H.) rather intimates. Vat. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. xi. 31.—Both significations agree with the context. See Job 5:27. Matt. 18:21. C.—He who is not subject to mortal sin, may still be exposed to many failings, and venial sins, which do not deprive him of the title of *just;* whereas the wicked consents to mortal sin, from which he riseth not so easily. Hence the wise man admonishes us not to lie in wait, or calumniously seek impiety in the house or soul of the just. W.  
**18** *From.* To punish thee. C.—Thus will thy thirst of vengeance be disappointed. H.—The Hebrews believed that there was no evil, which was not caused by sin; and this was true in some sense. But still God often afflicts his servants, (v. 16,) as the whole book of Job tends to prove. C.  
**19** *Contend.* Or Heb. “associate.”—*Like.* v. 1. Ps. 36:1.  
**20** *Come.* Prot. “no reward,” ( H.) prosperity, &c. as designated also by the *lamp.* v. 14. C.  
**21** *Detractors.* Or those who speak ill of God or the king. C.—Prot. “that are given to change,” ( H.) and relapses.  
**23** *These.* Sept. have an addition, and then our C. 30 to v. 15 after which follows the remainder of this chap. and then the ten first verses of the 31st. H.—Solomon here resumes the sententious style. C. 22:17. C.  
**26** *Lips.* And be deemed a friend. M.  
**27** *House*, and support thy family. Before building, great deliberation is requisite. Lu. 14:28. Those who attempt to instruct others, must first set good example.  
**28** *Cause*, and necessity. Sept. “be not a false witness against thy fellow-citizen.”  
**29** *Work.* Revenge is often reprobated, though the law allowed of retaliation, which the more virtuous did not insist upon.  
**30** *Man.* Those who neglected their land were despised. C.—The ancient Romans esteemed agriculture as a most laudible and profitable employment. Cato. Rust. i. Cic. Off. i.  
**32** *Which.* Sept. “at last I repented: I looked forward to receive instruction.”  
**33** *Said I*, is not in Heb. C. 6:10. C.—Sept. “I will slumber a while,” to rest. Sept. “I will enfold my breast in *my* hands a little.” H.

## Chapter 25

**1** *These.* Solomon wrote 3,000, and we have only 915 verses extant. C.—The rest perhaps shewed his genius, but were less useful. Tostat. in 3 K. iv. 9.—*Men.* Isaias, Sobna, &c. C.—*Out* of other records, ( M.) or “translated” into a language better understood. Carthus. Bayn.  
**2** *Speech.* The Scriptures will denounce the truth to them, and shew them how to reign with justice. We must adore the mysteries of God; but are allowed to examine the secret designs of princes.  
**3** *Unsearchable.* Their counsellors must not betray their secrets. Tob. 12:7. The greatest enterprises depend on secrecy.  
**5** *Justice.* The wicked in a kingdom resemble rust on silver. C.  
**6** *Glorious*, or a boaster. H.—We must not seek the first places. Lu. 14:10.  
**8** *Not.* Sept. “repent when thy friend may reproach thee.” H.—*Friend.* A word spoken in haste may expose him to ridicule.  
**9** *Stranger.* It sometimes happens that friends fall out; but if either disclose the secret of the other, he will be deemed infamous. C. Jos. con. Ap. 2.—S. Ambrose says of his brother Satyrus, “though we had all things in common, yet the secret of our friends was not so.”  
**10** *Grace*, &c. is no in Heb. Compl. S. Jerom, &c. But it is in the Sept. “favour and friendship may give liberty; which keep thou for thyself, that thou mayst not be exposed to great shame. But guard thy ways unchangeably.” H.—Avoid quarrels.  
**11** *Time*, (Symmachus) “on its wheels,” (Heb.) flowing smoothly, ( C.) or “according to his two faces, is apples of gold in network of silver. The Scriptures have a double sense. The exterior one leads to that sense which is interior, and more excellent. Maimonid. Parkhurst, p. 366.—*Gold*, oranges.—*Beds.* On such the kings of Parthia slept, and these metals were very common under Solomon, 3 K. 10:27. Est. 1:6. C.—Mont. renders *mascioth* “transparent cases.” Prot. “*pictures* of silver.”  
**12** *Bright.* Heb. chali cathem, “an ornament of fine gold,” (Mont. Prot. H.) may probably denote a collar or ring. The eastern nations wore rings fixed at the top of the ears, and under the nose. Some were so large that they put their meat through them. The Scripture often alludes to these customs, which are so different from ours. Cant. 7:1.  
**13** *Harvest.* In June and July, when the heat was most intense, people of quality had snow from Libanus to mix with what they drank. Jer. 18:14. C.  
**15** *Hardness.* Heb. and Sept. “bones.” H.  
**16** *Up.* We must moderate the sensual appetite, ( M.) and even the study of wisdom, which is compared to honey. C. 24:13. Rom. 12:3. Eccle. 7:17. C.—We must not be too familiar, v. 17. Ven. Bede. Cajet.  
**17** *Having.* Heb. “being tired of thee.” No man is so perfect, but he will manifest some defect, and become importunate. C.  
**20** *And.* Prot. “as he that taketh away a, &c. *and as* vinegar … to a heavy heart.” H.—The former sentence may be joined with the preceding, as it is improper to deprive a person of his garment, no less than to trust in the faithless; though some would suppose ( C.) that this conduct, as well as the mixing of vinegar with nitre, is no less absurd than to attempt to relieve by music those who are extremely afflicted. Eccli. 22:6. T.—But Solomon does not speak of such, but only of those who are “heavy;” and we know that music has wonderful efficacy in relieving them, (1 K. 16:17) in like manner as this mixture serves to cleanse the skin and garments, (Jer. 2:22. C.) and to purify the ears, when they are deafish. Pliny xxxi. 10. Vales. lx.—*As a*, &c. is not in Heb. S. Jer. &c. C.—The Chal. has the latter part, ( H.) “grief tries the heart, as fire does silver. As the worm eats wood, so folly,” &c. C.  
**22** *Coals* of charity; (S. Chrys. in Rom. xii. 20) or, if he prove obstinate, his punishment will be the greater. Geier.—The former sense is more received. C.  
**23** *Rain;* (Sym. Prot.) or marginal note, “bringeth forth rain.” H.—But S. Jerom, who live in the country, knew that this wind was rather dry; and therefore he has abandoned the Sept. raiseth the clouds.” Job 37:9. Joel 2:20. Eccli. 18:23. The countries north of Palestine were not calculated to produce vapours and rain, which came rather from the south. C.—*Tongue.* If the hearers would shew their displeasure, detractors would soon be reduced to silence. S. Jer. ad. Rust. S. Bern.  
**24** *It is.* C. 21:9. Sixtus V. does not insert this verse here.  
**25** *Tidings.* Heb. and Sept. The Vulg. seems rather to speak of a “good messenger.” Homer said that a good messenger honoured the business most. Pind. Pyth. viii. C.  
**26** *Falling* into disgrace, or sin, occasions the wicked to exult, as if there were no God or religion. C.  
**27** *Majesty*, viz. of God. For to search into that incomprehensible *Majesty*, and to pretend to sound the depths of the wisdom of God, is exposing our weak understanding to be blinded with an excess of light and glory, which hit cannot comprehend. Ch.—When the Church proposes to us any mystery, we have only to believe. Heb. “but it is glorious to sound their glory,” and see where the wicked end, that we may not envy them. C. 3:31. Ps. 36:7. C.—Prot. “so *for men* to search their own glory, *is not* glory,” but a sin. H.—“It is not good to eat too much honey,” (Chal.) or to sound the glorious words of God and wisdom, or the mysteries of religion. Sept. “But it is right to reverence glorious speeches,” ( C.) with esteem and humility. Cat. Græc.  
**28** *Spe* *aking.* He lays himself open to every attack. C. 29:11.

## Chapter 26

**1** *Glory* and power. A fool in a high office will endanger himself and the public; ( C.) while the virtuous, seeing that merit is not regarded, will not push themselves forward. Æschines.  
**2** *As a bird*, &c. The meaning is, that a curse uttered without cause shall do no harm to the person that is cursed, but will return upon him that curseth; as whithersoever a bird flies, it returns to its own nest. Ch.—*Come.* Chal. “shall not come in vain,” if it be just, like that of Noe, Josue, &c. Heb. “shall not come” ( C.) to the person against whom it is uttered, though God will not hold the curser guiltless, as the Vulg. intimates. H. Curses, anathemas, &c. vented without reason, do not injure any but those who denounce them. Yet out of respect for ecclesiastical authority, those who are under censures, must abstain from their functions till they be absolved. C.  
**3** *Snaffle.* “Bit,” or muzzle, (*camus*) to prevent the animal from biting. H.—Sept. Arab. &c. “a goad for an ass.” But metheg denotes a bridle. (Mont. H.) asses being there very large, and commonly used for riding. C. 13:13. C.  
**4** *Answer not a fool*, &c. Viz. so as to imitate him; but only so as to reprove his folly. Ch.—If thou answer at all, (v. 5) do it to the purpose, and to prevent others from taking scandal, ( C.) as well as to humble the wicked, for his good. H.  
**6** *Iniquity.* He is exposed to shame, (Sept.) and must condemn his own folly. C.  
**7** *Fair.* Heb. “unequal legs,” *or* “lifted up,” so, &c. H.  
**8** *Mercury.* The god of travellers, who were wont to throw a stone at the foot of his statue, as the Indians (Vincent. Bellor. xxiv.) and Arabs did. Mahomet would not disturb this superstitious custom. The Rabbins style these statues Mercolis. But Sept. &c. give another sense, “as he that bindeth a stone ( C.) in the boss of a ring, σφενδονη, ( M.) or in a sling,” can do no good, but only endanger himself or others, “so,” &c. Yet margema is never used elsewhere for a sling, and it means undoubtedly “a heap of stones,” ( C.) as Mont. substitutes instead of “the sling,” in Pagn. “As a small piece of precious stone in a heap of stones *is lost*, so,” &c. Pole. Syn. Parkhurst in rogom. H.—*Honour*, or an office, in which he may do harm. C.  
**9** *If.* Heb. “*as* a thorn goeth up into the,” &c. Prot. H.—If he attempt to handle or to extract one, he will wound himself the more, as the fool would render truth and wisdom contemptible. C.—*Parable.* Sept. “but slavery in the hands of fools” groweth up. H.  
**10** *Anger*, and prevent lawsuits. Heb. is variously read and translated. C.—Prot. “the great *God*, that formed all things, both rewardeth the fool and rewardeth the transgressors.” Marg. “a great man giveth all, and he hireth the fool,” &c. Sept. “all the flesh of fools is exposed to many storms, for their excess is punished.” H.  
**11** *Dog.* This is the only animal which is known to do so. S. Peter uses this comparison to deter any from renouncing the faith; as the Fathers do, to shew the misery attending a relapse. Sept. here add, “there is a confusion,” &c. taken from Eccli. 4:25. C.  
**12** *Fool.* The ignorant may be convinced that he wants instruction. C.—But “none are worse than the half-learned.” Quintil. i. Jo. 5:21.  
**14** *Bed*, which he will scarcely leave, though avarice push him forward. S. Aug. ser. xxii. or clxiv.  
**16** *Seven*, or many wise men, who used to speak in a sententious manner. C.—So seven is used, v. 25.  
**17** *Anger.* Heb. “passeth by, *and* meddleth with a quarrel not ot him” pertaining. H.—Such expose themselves foolishly to danger. Great discretion is requisite to reconcile those at variance.  
**19** *Jest.* He will not escape, no more than the person who had committed murder involuntarily, if he were not in a city of refuge. Num. 35:22.  
**20** *Faileth.* Heb. Sym. C. “aboundeth, the fire is bright, *or* flourisheth.” Sept. H.  
**23** *Dross.* Hence the proud will be detested, and appear contemptible.  
**24** *Lips.* He will speak of what he hates much.  
**26** *Deceitfully.* Heb. “in desolation.” He will cringe, but when he finds an opportunity, he will discover his evil designs. C.  
**27** *Him.* “Bad advice is worst to him who gives it.” Varro. Rust. iii. 22.

## Chapter 27

**2** *Lips.* All hate affectation and vanity. Jo. 5:41.  
**3** *Both.* He is insupportable to himself and to others. Eccli. 22:17.  
**4** *And who.* Sept. “but envy (zeal) beareth nothing.” The more we yield to the envious, the more he is offended at our good behaviour.  
**5** *Love.* Which can be of no service to us, while reproof may cause us to amend.  
**6** *Enemy.* Joab slew Amasa, while he kissed him. 2 K. 20:9. Matt. 26:48. True friendship is not attentive to outward appearances.  
**8** *Place*, or vocation, like the prodigal son, Lu. 15. The Israelites were much attached to their own country, where they might practise the true religion. C.  
**9** *And.* Sept. add, “*wine* and incense … but accidents tear the soul.” H.  
**10** *Affliction.* He will be less compassionate than a tried friend.—*Better*, &c. This daily experience evinces. “Those who purchase land, should consider if there be plenty of water, and a neighbour.” Pliny xviii. 5.—The Persians honour most those who live nearest to them. Herod. i. 134.  
**11** *Thou.* Heb. Complut. and Sixtus V. “I may,” &c. Sept. “and cast reproaches from thee.”  
**14** *In the night.* Or “early in the morning,” *de nocte*, as the Heb. implies.—*Curseth.* His importunity will be equally displeasing. H.—Flattery is dangerous, ( C.) and unworthy of a free man. Cic. de Amic.  
**16** *Hand.* As it will flow away, such as woman is commonly incorrigible. C.  
**17** *Sharpeneth.* Or instructeth. *Fungar vice cotis* *.* Hor. Art.  
**18** *Glorified.* He who serves his master well shall be promoted.  
**19** *Are.* Heb. “to men.” Our hearts have all something similar. C.—Sept. “as faces are not like each other, so neither are the hearts of men.” They have all come peculiarity. H.—But this agrees not with the original.  
**20** *Destruction.* Heb. abaddo, or abadon. C. 15:11. Apoc. 9:11. People *die*, and are plunged in *hell* daily.—*Eyes.* Avarice and ambition. Eccli. 14:9.  
**21** *Praiseth.* If he be not puffed up, or if all agree in his praises, we may conclude that they are well founded.—*The*, &c. is not in Heb. Comp. S. Jer. or Chal. and destroys the connection.  
**22** *Mortar.* Such were used by those who could not afford handmills. C.  
**23** *Flocks.* Jo. 10:3. Eccli. 7:24. This may be applied to pastors.  
**24** *Generation.* Thou wilt be cited as an example of prudence, if thou hast forseen the change of thy affairs, and provided for it. In the east it was not unusual to see a general of an army reduced to the meanest condition, and economy is necessary for all.  
**26** *Field.* If thou wishest to purchase, or to pay the workmen.  
**27** **Ve** **r.** **27** **.** *Milk.* We cannot but admire such frugality. Sept. are rather different. C. v. 25, “Be careful of the grass of thy field … that thou mayst have lambs for thy clothing. Honour the field, that there may be lambs for thee. 27 Son, thou hast from me solid instructions for thy life, and for that of thy servants.” H.

## Chapter 28

**1** *Pursueth* *.* “A crime is its own punishment.” Senec. ep. 93. Lev. 26:36.—*Dread.* Of any thing terrestrial, as long as the object of his love is not attacked. Rom. 8:35.  
**2** *Princes* *.* Who each contend for the sovereign power. C.  
**8** *Poor.* It seldom happens that the unjust leave their riches to their children. C. 13:22. Job 27:16.  
**9** *His.* Sept. “he rendereth his prayer abominable.”  
**13** *Mercy.* This is true repentance, which enjoins, “not only to bewail past sins, but also to amend.” S. Amb. ii. Pen. v.—Sacramental confession was not required of the Jews, but they confessed their sins, when they laid their hands on the victim, &c. Lev. 4 and 5. C.  
**16** *Prudence.* Sept. “riches.” Poverty is a great temptation to people in authority, more than avarice itself. C.  
**20** *Innocent.* Unpunished, if he employ fraud, v. 22 c. 13:21.  
**21** *Forsaketh* *.* Heb. “oppresseth (Sept. selleth) a man.” C.—Neither small nor great bribes must be taken. Justinian.  
**22** *Poverty.* Sept. “the merciful shall have power over him.” v. 8. H.  
**28** *Men.* Sept. “the just groan,” and all are under “apprehensions.” C.

## Chapter 29

**8** *Corrupt.* Heb. “scoffers,” who provoke both God and men.  
**9** *Rest;* or bring him to hear reason. C.—Sept. “a wise man shall rule nations; but the wicked being angry, is laughed at, and does not frighten.”  
**10** *Soul.* they wish to protect the upright. Ps. 141:5.  
**13** *Enlightener.* Sept. “visitor,” with punishment, as they seem to speak of palliated usury, which cannot escape God. See C. 22:2.  
**18** *Prophecy*, by the urim, or by the mouth of prophets, who were in great power and estimation. 3 K. 1:24 and 12:23. and 2 Par. 25:6 and 28:8. C.—Sept. “There shall be none to explain *the law* to the impious nation.” H.—When pastors are wanting, all goes to ruin. 1 Cor. 11:4. Ven. Bede. C.  
**20** *Amendment.* S. Jerom (as Evag.) says, after Thucydides: “Ignorance produces confidence, and learning fear.”  
**24** *Soul*, and exposeth himself to death, though this was only inflicted for stealing a man. Ex. 21:16. The night-thief might also be killed in the fact. Ex. 22:2. But if the person who had stolen denied it on oath, he was put to death for perjury. Lev. 5:1.  
**25** *Fall.* Human respects will not long preserve him from sin. C.—Sept. have a double version: “Those who fear and are ashamed of men, shall be thrown down. But he who confideth in the Lord, shall rejoice. Impiety overturneth man, while he who trusteth in the Lord shall be saved.” Grabe. H.

## Chapter 30

**1** *Gatherer*, &c. or, as it is in the Latin, *Congregans*, the son of *Vomens* *.* The Latin interpreter has given us in this place the signification of the Hebrew names, instead of the names themselves, which are in the Hebrew, *Agur, the son of Jakeh.* But whether this Agur be the same person as Solomon, as many think, or a different person, whose doctrine was adopted by Solomon, and inserted among his parables or proverbs, is uncertain. Ch.—*Vomiter* may denote David, who delivered many excellent canticles; *Eructavit cor*, Ps. 44. De Dieu translates, “The words of him who is recollected the son of obedience.” The author styles himself foolish, and asks for neither beggary nor riches, (v. 2, 8) which seems not to agree with Solomon; though there can be no doubt but this chapter is inspired. C.—In effect, that great king might form this petition, being mindful of the instability of human greatness, and confess that of himself he was foolish.—*Vision.* Heb. massa ( H.) generally implies something disagreeable, but here it is put for a collection of moral sentences.—*With*, &c. Heb. also, “to Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,” (Prot. H.) friends of Agur, ( C.) or his children, ( M.) or rather Solomon speaks to all the faithful. We never find Agur mentioned as a canonical writer; and if he were, he would have been placed after Solomon. W.  
**2** *With me.* He speaks of what he could claim of his own, abstracting from the prophetic light. C.—In his humility, he supposeth that others are more perfect. The wisest know best their own defects. W.  
**4** *Descended.* How then could I acquire such a sublime science? Deut. 30:11. C.—Christ alone could impart it, (Jo. 3:13. H.) who is the perfect wisdom. W.—*Hands.* Sept. “breast.” H.—It is no less difficult to fathom the designs of Providence. Some understand the “spirit” of prophecy to be here meant.—*Son.* Sept. “children.” But many Greek copies, and all the interpreters, have *Son*, which the Fathers explain of the second person of the blessed Trinity, specified C. 8:22. C.  
**5** *Is fire-tried;* that is, most pure, like gold purified by fire. Ch. Ps. 17:31. Jer. 23:29.—It cannot deceive.  
**6** *And not any thing* contrary. Deut. 4:2 and 12:32.—*Liar.* Our Saviour condemned the false explanations of the Pharisees, as his Church does those of all heretics.  
**8** *Words*, which are so opposite to thine. v. 5.—*Riches.* The former often prompts men to deceive, the latter to grow proud and forget God.  
**10** *Accuse.* Sept. “deliver not” to an idolater. Deut. 23:15. Rabbins—*Servant.* Add not to his affliction. W.—We must suppose that the accusation is frivolous or false. Lyran.—A servant may do a person much injury: but this ought not to deter the other from performing what justice and charity require.  
**15** *The horse-leec* *h:* concupiscence, which hath two daughters that are never satisfied, viz. lust and avarice. Ch.  
**16** *Womb.* Sept. “the love of a woman,” ( H.) a harlot, or rather Heb. “a barren woman.”—*Enough.* The more fuel, the brighter the flame. These four similitudes may denote cruelty, lust, avarice, and prodigality; ( C.) or the first and last may be understood ( H.) of envy and ambition. W.  
**17** *Labour* *.* Sept. &c. “old age.” Heb. “the obedience or admonition.” Those who curse their parents, were sentenced to death. Lev. 20:6.  
**19** *Youth.* Heb. “a virgin.” The “conception of a mighty man (the Messias. H.) in a virgin,” is fitly compared to the flight of an eagle in the air, which leaves no *trace* behind, and is the most difficult to comprehend. See Jer. 31:22. Univ. Hist. iii. p. 144, note. Is. 7:14. Parkhurst in *álm* *.* H.—Some of the Jews have admitted this explanation. A. Lap.—Others understand that the marks of virginity are equivocal; (Bossuet, &c.) or, if we stick to the Vulg. and Sept. the difference betwixt a child and a young man is extremely great, and almost incomprehensible. C.—Young people who follow their carnal appetite, can no more give an account of their actions than of the course of an eagle, &c. W.—His wanderings are manifold. The Heb. seems to contain a prophecy of Christ’s conception.  
**23** *Mistress*, and is married to her master. She will generally prove insolent; like slaves on the throne, *Regnabit sanguine multo ad regnum quisquis venit ab exilio* *.* Suet. Tib. 59. C.  
**27** *Bands*, like an army. When one rises or falls, all do the like. They are so numerous in the East, as to darken the sun and spread destruction. Joel 1 and 2. C.  
**28** *The stellio.* A kind of house lizard, marked with spots like stars, from whence it has its name. Ch.—Heb. semamith. H.—It probably provides food against the stormy season, like ants. Bochart. C.—Others understand “the spider,” (Kimchi) or “monkey.” Vat. &c.  
**30** *Meeteth* *.* If he retreat, he looks back with disdain, till the woods conceal the turpitude of his flight. Pliny viii. 16.  
**31** *Loins.* It rules, and is even terrible to lions. Pliny x. 21.—The terms of the original are found nowhere else, and some understand the horse, the bee, and a soldier in arms. C.—*Whom.* Heb. “and Alkum with him.” Mont.—But we know no animal or king of this name;; and it may imply, “in the midst of his court,” or “assembly.” Chal. Some Latin copies read, *Et Rex, nec est qui resistat ei*, (Sixt. V.) which is more conformable to the Heb. ( C.) and is here translated, though the Vulg. read, *Nec est rex qui*, &c. These four emblems ( H.) denote fortitude, chastity, order, and justice.  
**32** *Mouth.* Fools ought not to govern. W.—Many might have been deemed wise, if they had continued in a lower station. C.—Heb. “If thou hast acted foolishly in raising thyself, and if thou hast entertained evil thoughts, *put* thy hand to thy mouth.” H.—Chal. “put not thy,” &c. Give not way to pride, or to insolent language. C.  
**33** *And.* Heb. “For he who presseth milk.” C.—Prot. “Surely the churning of milk bringeth for butter,” &c. H.—*Strife.* Moderation is necessary, ( C.) in all actions. W.

## Chapter 31

**1** *Lamuel* *.* This name signifies, *God with him;* and is supposed to be one of the names of Solomon. Ch.—Grotius would explain it of Ezechias. But why should we abandon the tradition of both Jews and Christians?—*Mother;* Bethsabee, who it seems was inspired, unless she received these maxims from Nathan. Solomon always speaks of her with the utmost respect, as a prudent mother may have the greatest influence over the tender minds of her children. C. 1:8 and 23:25.  
**2** *Vows.* She seems unable to express her concern for him when he first mounted the throne, and shewed her the greatest reverence. 3 K. 2:19.  
**3** *Women.* This would destroy thy health, and tend to impoverish the kingdom.—*Kings*, by injustice and ambition. C.  
**4** *Give.* Sept. “Do all with counsel. By advice drink wine. Lords are inclined to anger; let them not drink wine.” H.—Solomon took this advice. Eccle. 2:3.  
**5** *Poor.* Solon condemned to death, at Athens, the prince who should get drunk; and the Areopagites excluded from their assembly a judge who had dined in a tavern. Laert. 1. Athen. xiii. 2.  
**6** *Drink.* Heb. shecar, particularly palm-wine.—*Are sad.* Heb. “perish,” being sentenced to die; (Mark 15:23. Amos 2:8) or, who grieve and mourn for one deceased. On such occasions no food was prepared in the house, but the friends supplied what was necessary, and went to eat and drink with the afflicted. Eccle. 7:3.  
**7** *More.* Not that intoxication is permitted even to them.  
**8** *Pass* through life, or the country. C.—Sept. “Open thy mouth and judge righteously. Render justice to the poor and weak.” H.—Doctrine is best received by those who are more ready to hear than to speak. W.  
**10** *Who.* The following verses are in alphabetical order. They contain a grand eulogy of Bethsabee, who repented, or of a perfect matron. C.—Such are rare, though they may be found. W.—*Valiant;* industrious.—*Price.* Formerly people bought their wives. C.—*Is.* Heb. “is far above riches (Prot. H.) or pearls.” Lam. 4:7.  
**11** *Spoils*, taken in war. His wife will supply all necessaries. v. 21.  
**13** *Hands*, with skill and industry, ( C.) or “willingness.” Heb. *M*.—Ladies of the highest quality formerly employed themselves in this manner, like Penelope. Alexander, Augustus, and Charlemagne wore garments, which their sisters or wives had wrought. Curt. 5. Suet. 64. Eginhard.  
**14** *Bread;* all that is used for meat and drink. Sept. “riches.” Grabe, “livelihood:” Βιον. H.  
**15** *Night*, or early in the morning, as soon as the night was over; *de nocte*. Heb. “while it is yet night.” H.—Extreme vigilance is required of those who direct others. “The master must be first up, and last in bed.” Cato v.  
**16** *Considered.* This conduct is suggested by prudence. C.—Cato (Rust. 2.) says, “Do not go only once round the field,” &c.  
**17** *Arm;* working, and making others obey.  
**18** *Night*, during a great part of which she will work.  
**19** *Strong things*, “becoming” (Sept.) her station. C.—*S* *pindle.* She purposes and begins well, trusting in God for perfection and a reward. W.  
**21** *Domestics.* Heb. “house is clothed in purple,” which may be understood of the domestics, though it seems more probably to refer to her husband and children.  
**22** *Tapestry*, for the beds and floor.—*Linens*, or cotton; *byssus* *.* Ex. 25:4.  
**23** *Gates.* Chal. “provinces.” The rich were chosen for judges. C.  
**24** *The Chanaanite*, the merchant; for Chanaanite, in Hebrew, signifies *a merchant.* Ch.—The Phœnicians travelled into all countries. Traffic was not then deemed a discredit, even to kings.—*Girdl* *es* were worn both by men and women, and were very costly, insomuch that ( C.) the kings of Persia assigned cities to furnish their wives with them. Athen. i. in Antylla.—They who practise and teach the law may be said to buy and sell. W.  
**25** *Clothing:* it is very beautiful, or wisdom and virtue surround her.—*Day.* She fears not death, ( C.) or future distress of hunger, &c. Jans.  
**26** *Tongue.* She is ever bent on doing good. H.—Very different from many of her sex, who are taken up with vanity and complaints. C.  
**27** *Idle*, out of a sense of duty, and not though avarice.  
**28** *Her.* They were best able to judge of her merit.  
**30** *Lord.* Hitherto natural qualifications appear: but to these the Christian matron must add sincere piety: and thus Solomon completes the character of his mother, ( C.) who had given him such excellent instructions, or of any accomplished woman. Outward beauty soon ( H.) decays; but the fear of God is more deserving of praise. W.  
**31** *Gates*, before all the judges ( H.) and people. M.—Good works shall be rewarded at God’s tribunal, ( W.) when the vain worldly beauty shall be covered with confusion. H.—This idea of a perfect woman is best verified in the Catholic Church, (S. Aug. Ven. Bede) though the blessed Virgin, &c. may also be designated. W.—The use of the alphabet herein denotes, that we must begin with a moral good life, if we would penetrate the greater mysteries of the Scriptures. S. Jerom. Lam.
