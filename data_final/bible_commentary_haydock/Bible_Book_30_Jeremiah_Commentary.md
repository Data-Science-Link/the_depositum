# Jeremiah Commentary

**Jeremias** was a priest, a native of Anathoth, a priestly city, in the tribe of Benjamin, and was sanctified from his mother’s womb to be a prophet of God; which office he began to execute when he was yet a child in age. He was in his whole life, according to the signification of his name, *great before the Lord*, and a special figure of Jesus Christ, in the persecutions he underwent for discharging his duty, in his charity for his persecutors, and in the violent death he suffered at their hands; it being an ancient tradition of the Hebrews, that he was stoned to death by the remnant of the Jews who had retired into Egypt, ( Ch.) at Taphnes. His style is plaintive, ( W.) like that of Simonides, ( C.) and not so noble as that of Isaias and Osee. S. Jer.—He was the prophet of the Gentiles, as well as of the Jews, predicting many things which befell both, and particularly the liberation of the latter, A. 3485, after the seventy years’ captivity, dating from A. 3415, ( C.) or 3398, the 4th of Joakim. Usher C. 25. H.—He began to prophesy when he was very young, A. 3375, in the 13th year of Josias, ( C.) before that prince had brought his reformation to any great perfection. H.

## Chapter 1

**1** *Helcias*, the high priest who discovered the book of the law, (Clem. Strom. i. &c.) though this be uncertain.—Anathoth, a village to the north of Jerusalem, to which many priests had retired, though it did not belong to them. C.  
**3** *Joakim.* His immediate predecessor and successor, both called Jechonias, ( H.) are passed over, as their reign was short, ( C.) only lasting three months each. H.—*Fifth.* Jerusalem was taken on the 9th of the preceding month. But the temple was not burnt, nor the captives sent off till the fifth month, or the 10th of the civil year. C. 39:8 and 52:13 and 4 K. 25:2. C.—Jeremias also prophesied in Egypt. C. 44. W.—But this title alludes to his principal predictions. M.  
**5** *Knew*, with affection, and designed thee for this office for eternity. Many think ( C.) that Jeremias was purified from original sin before his birth. S. Aug.—He had this privilege, and was also a priest, prophet, virgin, and martyr. W.—Yet to *sanctify*, often means only to set aside. Ex. 13:2. Eccli. 49:9.—*Nations*, whose overthrow he points out. C. 25:27. 32. &c. C.  
**6** *Ah.* Heb. ahah*.* Sept. “thou Being.” Prot. “Then said I: Ah, Lord God.” H.—He does not imitate a child. He might be above 30 years old, though some say ( C.) only 14, ( T.) or less; yet he finds himself devoid of eloquence, like Moses. Ex. 14:10. C.  
**9** *Mouth;* perhaps H. with a coal, by means of an angel, (Is. 6:5) in a sort of dream. He found himself changed into a new man.  
**10** *Root up*, to announce the fall and restoration of many nations. Ezec. 4:2. C.—Jeremias spoke of the Gentiles, as well as of the Jews. W.  
**11** *Watching.* Heb. “of an almond.” Sept. “nut-tree.” H.—The almond-tree flourishes in January, and bears fruit in March. Theod. Pliny xvi. 25.—Thus God will speedily send his scourge from Babylon, to punish his people. C.—The sense is the same. M.—God’s law is outwardly bitter, but the kernel is sweet. Theod. W.  
**13** *North*, whence the wind blows, to make the fire burn more intensely. Assyria lay to the north, and Babylon to the east of Judea; but the troops always penetrated the northern frontier, as they could not pass through the Desert Arabia. The *caldr* *on* represented Jerusalem. Ezec. 11:3 and 24:3.  
**14** **Ver.** **14–15** **.** *North.* The tributary kings were forced to attend. Judith 2:7 and 3 K. 20:1.—*About.* The princes thus took Sedecias, and sent him to Reblatha. C. 39:3. C.  
**17** *Loins.* Make haste, and take courage. Job 38:3. M.  
**19** *Prevail.* God does not promise peace, but victory. W.

## Chapter 2

**2** *Espousals.* He speaks ironically. Theod.—Yet the Israelites at first shewed greater proofs of love than they did afterwards. It is true they often prevaricated, in the wilderness. Ex. 32:1. Amos 5:25. Ps. 77. &c. C.—The Lord declares his gratuitous love, and then upbraids his people. H.—He had caused them to multiply in Egypt, and gratuitously made choice of them. W.  
**3** *Incr* *ease;* most desirable. Osee 9:10. God punished those who attempted to injure his people: yet they abandoned his service.  
**5** *Vanity;* idols, whom he will not mention, to spare their shame. C.  
**7** *Carmel.* That is, a fruitful, plentiful land. Ch. W.—All Palestine is thus designated. M.  
**8** *Priests* were silent, or abandoned themselves.—*Pastors;* “princes.” Chal. Manasses, Amon, &c.—In Baal, promoting his worship. H.—The land was full of false prophets, and none stood up for the Lord.  
**9** *Children;* the Israelites, under Moses, and their posterity transgressed.  
**10** *Cethim* *;* Macedon. It here denotes the western nations, as *Cedar* does those of the east.  
**11** *Glory;* the true God and his ark. Ps. 3:4 and 1 K. 4:21.  
**12** *Gates;* angels, or the temple.  
**13** *Water.* The idols and nations, to which they have had recourse, injure them. C.—The Jews did just the reverse to what God commanded. W.  
**14** *Slave.* From such, labour and tribute were required. Mat. 17:24. Jo. 8:33.  
**15** *Lions;* kings of Assyria, &c. The decree for the devastation of Juda had already passed, though it was not put in execution.  
**16** *Taphnes*, 16 miles from Pelusium, in Egypt. The nation proved only detrimental to the Jews, by engaging them in their abominations, instead of affording relief.  
**18** *Troubled.* Heb. shichor, or Nile *water*, (Jos. 13:3) which was thought as good as wine, and grew better for keeping. Strabo xvii.—Hence the people adored it. Vitruv. viii.—God often reproached the Jews for distrusting in his protection, and seeking aid from the Egyptians, who deceived them. We know not that Josias did so. C.—He even opposed them, and lost his life in defending the country. 4 K. 23:29. H.—He was probably obliged to pay tribute to the *Assyrians*, whom Achaz had called in. 2 Par. 28:23. These alliances the Lord condemned.  
**20** *Thou.* Sept. Yet Heb. and Chal. have, “I have *permissively* broken,” or foretold this infidelity.  
**21** *Chosen.* Heb. Sorek. Judg. 16:4. Is. 5:2 and 16:8. C.—God created all things good, planted his Church in justice, and no evil proceeds from Him. W.  
**22** *Borith* *.* An herb used to clean clothes, and take out spots and dirt, ( Ch.) like kali, soda, ( C.) or soap. Langius.—Prot. “and take thee much soap.” H.  
**23** *Valley* of Hinnom, under the very walls of Jerusalem. C.—*Runner.* Heb. “dromedary,” which takes its name from its swiftness. H.—The female camel continues all day with the male, and cannot be approached. Aristot. Pliny x. 63.—Juda is represented as no less libidinous. C.  
**24** *Away.* The female may easily be found by the poisonous *hippo-manes* *.* Georg. iii.—Thus Jerusalem is an impudent prostitute. H.  
**25** *Foot*, and the parts which modesty covers. My exhortations are slighted. C.—Despair opens the door to every sort of impurity. Eph. 4:19. H.  
**26** *Taken.* Juda affected still to be very pious. v. 23.  
**28** *Cities.* All were abandoned. Ezec. 16:24. Osee 10:1.  
**30** *Prophets;* Zacharias, (2 Par. 24:21.) Isaias, &c. Mat. 23:34. C.—Punishment is designed by God to cause people to repent. W.  
**31** *See*, or hear. The *sword* seems to be animated. C.—Lateward. Heb. “darksome land.” Have I not heaped blessings on my people?—*Revolted.* Prot. “Lords.” H.  
**33** *Thou who.* Heb. “Therefore have I.” C.—Prot. “hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.” H.—Thou hast opened a school of vice.  
**34** *In* *nocent* children, immolated to Moloc, or people murdered, whose blood thou hast not concealed. 4 K. 21:16.  
**37** *Head*, like the violated Thamar. 2 K. 13:19. The king of Egypt was routed, when coming to assist Sedecias. C. 37:3. 10. C.  

---

## Chapter 3

**1** *It.* Heb. “a saying.” Sept. “If,” &c. Deut. 24:1. H.—*Woman.* Heb. “land.”—*Lovers.* Sept. “shepherds,” C. seeking aid from idols and foreigners.  
**2** *High.* Lit. “straight forward.” H.—On the hills, idolatry and immorality prevailed.—*Ways*, where harlots used to sit. Gen. 38:14. Prov. 7:9 and 23:27.—*Robber;* “Arab,” (Chal. &c.) or “crow.” (Sept.) C.—No sin is so great as to be irremissible to the true penitent. W.  
**3** *Rain;* about November. Deut. 11:14. This drought happened under Josias, (C. 5:24) and was different from that specified, C. 8:13 and 14:1.  
**4** *Guide.* Husband. Prov. 2:16 and Joel 1:8.  
**5** *Wilt.* Heb. “will he,” &c. The faithless people will not use this language, but do all the evil possible.  
**6** *Days*, before the 18th year. God now pronounces sentence ( C.) on all. H.—*Rebellious*, a faithless wife. The kingdom of Israel gave way to idolatry first. But the people were less favoured than Juda, which had many prophets and good kings, the temple, &c. Moreover, the misfortunes of Israel did not open the eyes of their brethren. C.—Both the ten tribes, and the two tribes ( W.) which adhered to the line of David, prevaricated. H.  
**10** *Falsehood.* Their reform was only apparent, under Joas, &c. C.  
**11** *Soul*, and appeared comparatively innocent. v. 6. Ezec. 16:51. S. Jer.—Yet neither of them was excusable. W.  
**12** *North.* Samaria, or rather Assyria, where the people were captives.—*Face*, in anger.  
**13** *Ways*, dividing thy love, and adoring idols with me.  
**14** *Kindred.* Only few Israelites returned under Cyrus. The rest came by degrees, though it was more fully accomplished by the conversion of the Gentiles.  
**15** *Pastors.* Zorobabel, &c. but more particularly Christ and his apostles.  
**16** *Ark.* It was no longer at Jerusalem. The law and its figures cease.  
**17** *All.* Many might embrace the Jewish religion. But the predictions of the prophets on this head, were not verified, till the gospel was preached. C.—Then many embraced the faith: several captives also returned to God. W.  
**18** *North.* Sept. add, “and from all places” where the Jews were in captivity. H.—Many thus returned to their own country. v. 14. C.—Israel had been led into captivity sooner, but all were released at once. Theodor. W.  
**19** *Gentiles*, which they all covet, or to which they are invited in the Church. C.—*Me.* On these conditions thou shalt be restored. H.  
**21** *God.* Hence proceed these miseries and lamentations.  
**23** *Liars*, unfruitful; and the idols have left us empty. C.—They were placed on the hills. Houbigant.  
**24** **4** **.** *Confusion.* Thus Baal was styled *Boseth*, contemptuously. Jer. 11:13.  
**25** *Shame.* We are justly punished with exile, ( C.) and death. M.  

---

## Chapter 4

**1** *Blocks;* idols, ( C.) and other occasions of sin. H.  
**2** *Swear*, when requisite. C.—Thus thou wilt learn to confess one God. Theod.—If all were upright, oaths would be unnecessary. Mat. 5:34. But as they are not so, ( C.) this may be a religious act. W.—*Justice.* These three conditions are essential. H.—*Him;* the people, ( C.) or God. S. Jer.—An oath must attest God, and be used when a thing is true and of moment. W.  
**3** *Thorns.* Your misconduct hinders your advancement. C.  
**4** *Hearts.* Understand, and act with purity. H.  
**5** *Cities.* Nabuchodonosor is at hand.  
**7** *Robber.* Nabuchodonosor attacks unjustly, ( C.) though he be God’s scourge.  
**9** *Heart;* counsel and vigour.—*Prophets* of falsehood.  
**10** *Alas!* Prot. “Then I said: Ah! Lord God, surely thou hast deceived,” &c. ( H.) by permitting the people to follow false prophets. Is. 63:17. Ps. 43:19.  
**11** *Desert* of Arabia. It may designate Nechao, (2 Par. 35:20) who slew Josias, after whose death all fell to ruin.  
**15** *Ephraim.* At Bethel and Dan the calves were adored. C.—But they were now no more. H.—The irruption of Nabuchodonosor is announced. He set himself up for a god.  
**16** *Guards.* The Chaldees will besiege the city, and prevent provisions from entering. 4 K. 25:1. C.  
**19** *My.* God, (S. Jer.) the people, (Grot.) or rather Jeremias speaks.  
**20** *Moment.* The cities are destroyed as easily as a tent.  
**22** *Me*, practically. They have not honoured me as they ought. C.—If they were indeed devoid of sense, they would be excused. W.  
**23** *Void.* Heb. “Thohu and bohu,” like chaos. Gen. 1:2. H.  
**25** *Gone.* Beasts feel the wrath of God, and in a land uninhabited; not even birds will remain. Osee 4:3. S. Jer.  
**26** *Carmel:* the beautiful country of Palestine, ( H.) Jerusalem, (Theod.) or the mountain so called.  
**27** *Destroy*, when Jechonias was led captive. God allowed the people still eleven years to repent; and he afterwards restored the Jews. C.—He will never suffer his church to perish. W.  
**28** *Repented.* Only a finite being can do this. God’s resolution is here unconditional and fixed.  
**30** *Stone*, or antimony, like Jazabel, (4 K. 9:30) to darken and enlarge the eye-lids.—*Lovers.* Infidel nations of Egypt, &c.  
**31** *Child.* Heb. and Sept. “a first-born,” when the pains are most acute. C.  

---

## Chapter 5

**1** *Go*, Jeremias, and you who publicly adhere to me.—*Man.* Sodom would have been spared for the sake of ten just people. Gen. 18:32. Before the reform of Josias, Jerusalem was strangely corrupted, though these expressions be hyperbolical, and spoken as it were in the heat of debate. Josias, Holda, and others, were living at this time, and renowned for their piety.  
**2** *Falsely.* Some may confess my name. But they swear falsely. C. 4:2. C.—Unless the requisite conditions be observed, an oath is unlawful. W.  
**3** *Return.* The miseries with which, Achaz, &c. were afflicted, produced no amendment.  
**4** *Foolish* idiots, ( C.) who have had no means of receiving instruction. H.—Such might be more excusable; but when the chiefs offend, the evil is irremediable.  
**6** *Lion.* Nabuchodonosor.—*Wolf.* Cambyses, ( C.) and *leopard.* Epiphanes. H.—The Chaldees, Persians and Greeks afflicted them. S. Jer.—The first beast may designate Nabuc: the second Nabuzardon: the third, Alexander or Epiphanes. W.  
**7** *How can.* I have only the character of judge left. C.  
**8** *Stallions.* Heb. mashcim, ( H.) “stretching out,” as others translate. Ezec. 23:20. S. Jer.—The horse is the most intemperate of all animals but man. Aristot. Hist. vi. 22.  
**10** *Destroy*, at the first taking of the city, v. 18 and C. 4:27.—*Branches.* Children of Jechonias, (C. 22:30) and the people. C.—Heb. “her battlements,” ( H.) Chal. “palaces.”  
**13** *Them.* The evil shall fall on the head of these impostors. So the wicked deride the prophets ( C.) impugning the known truth. H.  
**14** *Fire.* Thou shalt declare their impending ruin.  
**15** *Ancient.* Nemrod founded the empire of Ninive and of Babylon. Gen. 10:10. Nabopolassar had succeeded to the ancient Assyrian and Chaldee sovereigns. Under his son, Nabuchodonosor, the dominions were much enlarged.—*Say.* 4 K. 18:26.  
**17** *Devour.* Heb. “destroy.” They did not eat human flesh.  
**19** *Own.* You shall thus know the difference between the masters. C.  
**21** *Understanding.* Lit. “heart.” C. 4:22. H.  
**22** *It.* Nature and chance are improper terms. God regulates all, and has established those laws which preserve the world.  
**24** *Rain*, in autumn and in spring. Deut. 11:14. C.—*Fulness.* Heb. “the weeks for harvest.” H.—That of barley began at the Passover, and that of wheat ended before the feast of weeks, (Ex. 34:22. Lev. 23:10. C.) or Pentecost. H.  
**25** *Away.* The rain comes unseasonably.  
**26** *Man.* As some tyrants have done, though this implies ( C.) the eagerness with which the wicked strive to corrupt mankind. H.  
**28** *Of* *the widow*, is not in Heb. C.—*Fatherless.* Prot. add, “yet they prosper, *and they*,” &c. H.  
**29** *Nation?* It is contrary to God’s justice not to punish the guilty. W.  
**31** *Clapped.* Heb. “came down to, *or* received in, *or* domineered by their hands.” The priests concurred with these impostors for their own ends. C.  

---

## Chapter 6

**1** *Strengthen.* Heb. also, “Flee, Benjamites, from the midst,” &c. Jerusalem belonged partly to this tribe, which prided itself on its valour.—*Thecua* was in the lot of Juda, 15 miles south of Jerusalem.—*North.* The Chaldees approach. C. 1:13. C.  
**3** *Shepherds.* So captains are styled, because they feed and govern soldiers. W.  
**4** *Prepare.* Lit. “sanctify.” Observe the usual formalities of demanding reparation, offering victims, &c. The Chaldees thus encourage one another, and will allow themselves no rest day or night. v. 5.  
**7** *Cold.* Heb. “come forth.” All the citizens imitate her vices.  
**8** *Instructed*, by afflictions and prosperity, by public and internal admonitions. Willful ignorance is criminal, and drives God away. C. 51:9. Ps. 80:12.  
**9** *Basket.* Chaldees, destroy all. Nabuchodonosor took Joakim twice, and afterwards Jechonias and Sedecias. C. 29:2.  
**10** *Uncircumcised.* Impure and deaf. C.—*Non vocat impossibilitas supplicio quæ de contemptu et i* *nfidelitate descendit* *.* S. Jer.  
**11** *In.* Jeremias is indignant. The Lord then orders him to *pour*, or declare what will ensue. C.  
**13** *Prophet.* Sept. “false prophet.” C. 4:31. H.  
**14** *Disgra* *cefully.* They shall be ashamed, when the contrary to what they declared shall come to pass. C. 8:11.  
**16** *Paths*, of patriarchs, and of Moses. Avoid novelty in religion. C.—This advice is very applicable to the present generation. H.  
**17** *Watchmen.* Prophets. Ezec. 3:17 and 33:2.  
**18** *Congregation.* Sept. “shepherds feeding their flocks have heard.” The Chaldees are apprised of my resolution against Juda. C.—After the Jews had been called repeatedly in vain, the Gentiles obey. Mat. 10:5. W.  
**20** *To me.* For want of proper dispositions; otherwise the offerings of the best things were enjoined, and commendable. The Jews are taught not to depend on external observances, while they neglect the heart. C.  
**22** *North.* As Babylon lay with respect to Jerusalem, ( W.) or rather to the east. H.  
**26** *Only son.* Let thy grief be extraordinary. Amos 8:10. Zac. 12:10.  
**27** *Trier* of my people, as of gold in the furnace. Job 22:25.  
**29** *Bellows*, or crucible.—*Lead*, which was intermixed to purify the dross (S. Jer.) of gold and silver. But brass and iron could not be thus purified. All would be lost labour. Afflictions do not correct the obstinate. C.  

---

## Chapter 7

**2** *Gate*, before all the people. This discourse ends C. 13. C.  
**3** *Dwell.* Heb. “make you dwell here.” H.  
**4** *Lord.* The triple repetition shews the vain confidence of the people, who blindly imagined that the temple would screen them, ( C.) and that external sacrifices would suffice. But they were rejected with the temple. W.  
**7** *Dwell.* Heb. and Sept. as v. 3. H.  
**9** *N* *ot*, which have done you no good, and deserve not to be styled gods. C.  
**10** *Because.* Hebrew also, “although,” (Sa. Grot.) “to perform,” (Chal. Mont.) or “by doing.” God must surely approve of our conduct, since we are unmolested. S. Tho. Lyr.—But the Vulg. seems preferable, and the people attribute their success to idols. C. 44:17 and 2 Par. 28:23.  
**11** *Robbers.* Our Saviour alludes to this. Mat. 21:13.—*Seen.* Think not to hide yourselves, as in a den. My temple shall not be an asylum for wretches. C.  
**12** *Beginning*, under Josue. H.—The sins of a few priests caused this place to be abandoned, (1 K. 2:22 and 3:4. Ps. 77:60) and shall the crimes of a whole people escape? C.—It is true, that place and Jerusalem were once sanctified: but the people being criminal, God retires. W.  
**13** **Ver** **.** **13** **.** *Early.* Sparing no opportunity of reclaiming you. C.  
**15** *Ephraim.* The ten tribes ( W.) had been led into captivity in the days of Ezechias, the great-grandfather of Josias. C.  
**16** *Praise*, offered to appease my wrath. H.—This admirably shews the force of the saints’ intercession, which God does not reject, but rather encourages by such declarations. Abraham and Moses did not leave off praying for the guilty, (Gen. 18:23. Ex. 32:10) and the Lord complains that there was none to withhold him. Is. 64:7. Ezec. 22:30. C.  
**18** *Heaven.* That is, the moon, which they worshipped under that name. Ch.—Some understand the sun also the stars. C. 44:17. Is. 65:11. All the family contributes to promote this idolatry.  
**21** *Flesh.* I reject your holocausts. Keep them for yourselves. C.  
**22** **V** **er.** **22** **.** *I commanded them not:* viz. such sacrifices as the Jews at this time offered without obedience; which was the thing principally commanded: so that in comparison with it, the offering of the holocausts and sacrifices was of small account. Ch.—The observance of the decalogue would suffice. Victims were to teach internal piety. Lev. 1. W.—God “brought them out of Egypt, not for the sake of their sacrifices, but that they might … hear his word.” S. Iræn. iv. 17.—This was the principal design. See Mat. 9:13. Os. 6:6 and 1 Cor. 1:17. Maldon. M. C.—The rules for sacrifices were given after the adoration of the calf, as necessary preservatives against idolatry. S. Tho. i. 2. q. 102. a. 3.—Yet the paschal lamb, &c. had been already commanded. C.—Many such absolute expressions imply a condition or comparison. Gloss. Prov. 8:10.—*I brought.* Several MSS. read thus more accurately than the Heb. “He brought,” (Ken.) which Prot. abandon, ( H.) though the present reading may stand. Chappel. Crat.—Every variation should be noticed, as this and the former verse “seem greatly corrupted; perhaps the Syr. version will be the best guide to their true meaning.” Kennicott.—Yet the passage is sufficiently intelligible in the Vulg. and Sept.  
**27** *Thee.* Sept. omit this verse, which Grabe replaces. The people will be more inexcusable. H.  
**29** *High.* People lamented in such places. C. 9:13. Judg. 11:35. C.—*Wrath*, which he treats with the utmost severity. H.  
**30** *Abominations.* Heb. We have lit. “stumbling-blocks,” *offendicula* *.* H.—Manasses placed idols in the very temple, as the last kings of Juda did. 4 K. 23:4. Ezec. 8:3.  
**31** *Valley*, to the south of the city. Here Moloc was adored, and Josias therefore contaminated the place. 4 K. 23:10. C.—It was very delightful. S. Jer.  
**32** *Place*, elsewhere. H.—This was verified when Nabuchodonosor and Titus besieged the city. C.—The latter was quite shocked. Jos. Bel. vi. 14. See C. 19 and 31:40.  
**34** *Bride.* None shall think of marrying, (C. 16:9 and 25:10. C.) all being filled with lamentation. M.

## Chapter 8

**1** *Graves.* They might suppose that they would find treasures in them, as the tombs of Semiramis, Cyrus, &c. were thus enriched. This inhumanity seems to have taken place before the last siege. Bar. 2:24. C.  
**4** *Again.* Why then do not the people strive to repent?  
**7** *Stork.* These birds retire at the approach of winter to warmer climates. In Poland swallows plunge into marshes, like frogs. If instinct teach them to do so, for their preservation, is it not strange that men should be so inconsiderate?  
**8** *Falsehood.* The impostors have deceived you, and they are themselves taken prisoners. C.  
**9** *Them.* Those who understand, and do not observe the law, are not wise. W.  
**10** *Others.* Idumeans, &c. Yet most part of the land remained uncultivated. C.—The rest, to v. 13. “they will collect their fruits, says,” &c. is supplied by Grabe. H.  
**12** *They are.* Or, “are they?” &c. S. Jer.—No, they are too hardened. C. 6:14.  
**13** *Gather* into Jerusalem, to be butchered. C.—*Away.* They are now in the greatest distress. H.—This probably happened a little before the last siege. C. 14.  
**14** *Silent*, in utter destruction. 1 K. 2:9. We cannot be in a worse condition.  
**16** Dan, by which the Chaldees must pass. C. 4:15. Many have hence inferred that antichrist will be the serpent (v. 17) of the tribe of Dan. Gen. 49:17. C.  
**17** *Charm.* The Chaldees will not be moved to pity ( M.) by any words. W.  
**18** *Me.* God, Jeremias, the people, or rather Jerusalem bewails her children. C.  
**19** *Sion.* Thus the people complain, ( M.) or God answers them that they had no reason to have recourse to idols for protection. C.  
**20** *Saved.* Our hopes of redress are vanished. We must still pine away for want of food. H.—The siege continues, though we had been assured it would shortly be terminated. C.—It commenced January 30, A. 3414. Soon after Nabuchodonosor went to meet Pharao, and having defeated him, returned about June, A. 3415, and after 390 days took the city, 27th of July, A. 3416. Usher C. 39:2. C. Ezec. 4:5. H.  
**21** *I.* Jeremias. M.—The prophet continues to speak in the next chap.  
**22** *Balm*, (*resina*) “turpentine,” ( C.) which was much used. Dioscor. i. 66.—*Galaad* was famous for the best. C. 46:11. Gen. 37:25.—*Closed?* Have I not sent prophets? But they will not be healed. C.

## Chapter 9

**1** *To.* Heb. is more expressive. C.—“Who will give my head waters, ( H.) or change it into water, and my eyes into a fountain.” C.—Prot. “Oh that my head were waters.” H.—The miseries of my people are so great, ( C.) a few tears would not suffice to bewail them. W.  
**2** *Men.* Why cannot I retire ( M.) from this scene of misery, or afford some consolation to the captives? Sept. “Who will give me the last station in the desert?” H.  
**3** *Lies.* They are bent on deceit ( C.) and murder, ( H.) v. 8. Ps. 63:4 and 119:2.  
**4** *Deceitfully.* A man must guard against his relations and domestics. Mic. 7:5. Mat. 8:34. C.  
**5** *Iniquity.* It is become natural to them. S. Jer.—They cannot lay the blame on the violence of passion. They sin on purpose. C.—Sept. “they have not left off, (6) in order to be converted. Usury upon usury; fraud upon fraud; they,” &c. H.  
**7** *Try them* in the crucible of war. C. 6:27. C.  
**10** *Owner.* Heb. mikne, “cattle,” or ( H.) “substance.” S. Jer.—*De* *parted.* Beasts and birds will not continue long after men cease to cultivate the country. Theod. C. 4:25 and 12:4. Soph. 1:3.  
**11** *Sand.* The stones were burnt to dust. 2 Esd. 4:2. C.  
**15** *Gall* *.* Heb. rosh, “poison,” &c. Deut. 29:18. H.  
**16** *Consumed.* C. 44:27. No country shall afford them protection. C.—The richer sort were made captives, and most of the people destroyed, but not all. C. 4:25. W.  
**17** *Wise*, in composing or singing the *Nænia*, or mournful songs, recording the praises of the deceased. C.—“This custom still subsists in Judea: women go about with dishevelled hair and naked breasts, with *mournful* tunes, exciting all to tears.” S. Jer.—Music was also used. Mat. 9:23. Thus feigned tears, at least, would supply the want of real ones.  
**21** *For.* This was the song. C.—*Streets.* Death spares none. The least suspecting fall. H.—It enters by the windows, if the doors be shut. Joel 2:8.  
**22** *Speak.* Our editions of the Sept. omit this word, though S. Jerom found it in his copies, ( C.) and in Theodotion, expressed by “death;” while others rendered it, “speak,” as the same letters dbr, may have both meanings, according as people may please to pronounce them. S. Jer.—Grabe supplies, “by death. (22.) These things, says the Lord.” H.  
**24** *Me.* Virtue will save, when riches, &c. will prove useless. M.—Phocilides, a pagan, said, ( C.) “Boast not of wisdom, strength, or riches great. One God is wise, and potent too, and rich.” H.  
**26** *Egypt.* the uncircumcised shall be punished as well as Juda, if they transgress. Only the Jewish nation properly observed the right of circumcision generally, or at first. Others imitated them, but with various ceremonies. C. Diss. Ezec. 31:18. Judith 14:6.—Hyrcan obliged the Idumeans to receive circumcision. Jos. Ant. xiii. 17.—*Round.* The Arabs, &c. Lev. 19:27. C.—*Heart.* All then became guilty. Rom. 2:25. M.—Neither these nations nor Juda was circumcised in heart, and of course were hypocrites. W.

## Chapter 10

**2** *Ways.* Religious rites. v. 3.—*Fear.* Worship. Lev. 19:14.—*Signs.* They were designed to point out the seasons. Gen. 1:14. C.—Heathens thought that they had a divine power. W.  
**4** *Asunder.* Is. 44:8. Bar. 6:3. Wisd. 13:11. The pagans themselves laughed at such folly. C.—If such things were gods, the makers and tools deserved more adoration: *Fabri deorum vel parentes numinum*, says Prudentius. The vanity of such idols was more easily discerned than that of the stars. W.  
**5** *Tree.* The ancient statues were ill-formed, (Diodor. 4.) before Dedalus brought the art to greater perfection, and gave them a living attitude.  
**6** *There.* Sept. omit the three following verses; and from v. 9. *all these*, &c. to the end of v. 10 which Grabe inserts in a different character. H.  
**7** *Wise.* MS. 2. has in the margin “kings,” perhaps more correctly. Kennicott.  
**8** *Vanity*, and shews them clearly to be foolish ( C.) and wicked. H.  
**9** *Ophaz*, or Phison, (Gen. 2:11. C.) the coast of Pegu, Faprobana, &c. M.  
**10** *Wrath.* God is the true cause of all that terrifies mankind.  
**11** *Heaven.* This verse is in Chaldee, for the captives to use at Babylon, to defend themselves. It should be in a parenthesis, as it interrupts the discourse. Perhaps it was added during the captivity.  
**13** *Voice.* Thunder, (Ps. 28:3) which is usually the forerunner of rain. Lightning is occasioned by the inflamed exhalations of conflicting clouds.  
**14** *Knowledge.* If it were real, he would see the vanity of idols. v. 8. C.  
**16** *Portion.* The Lord. H. Ps. 72:6.—*Rod*, to measure, (Ps. 73:2) or the sceptre and ruler. M.  
**17** *Shame.* Idols. See if they will keep thee. Heb. “thy merchandise,” or most precious effects.  
**18** *Found* by the enemy. Heb. also, “find” me, being taught by affliction. C. 29:13. C.—Entering into sentiments of penance, they shall say, *Woe*, &c. H.  
**22** *North.* He has announced this conqueror eight times.—*Dragons. Tannim* means “huge reptiles,” whether of sea or land. C.  
**23** *The way*, &c. Notwithstanding man’s free-will, yet he can do no good without God’s help, nor evil without his permission. So that, in the present case, all the evils which Nabuchodonosor was about to bring upon Jerusalem, could not have come but by the will of God. Ch. W.—This prince succeeds by thy order. Theod.—Yet chastise us as a father, and have us not to his fury. v. 24. C.—“Let new preachers blush, who say that each one is governed by his own will,” (S. Jer. C. ix. 23) and able to do good without God’s grace. H.  
**24** *Judgment.* C. 30:11. Ps. 6:1. Justice is not contrary to mercy. C.  
**25** *Glory.* This is repeated from Ps. 78:6. M.—The prophet supposes that these nations will not repent, and that their sins are more enormous. To see God’s people treated with greater severity, might scandalize the weak, while infidels would take occasion to abuse their own impunity. C.  

---

## Chapter 11

**1** *The*, &c. He continues his discourse, (v. 15) or rather addresses the people, when Josias renewed the covenant. 2 Par. 34:29. Lev. 26. Deut. 27. C.  
**4** *Fathers.* God chooses his people for obedience, not for kindred, &c. S. Jer. W.  
**5** *Amen.* Sept. “So be it.” H.—Thou hast fulfilled thy engagements.  
**6** *Cities*, or to those who come thence to the temple, that all may know.  
**7** *For.* This and the next verse have not been read by Sept.; ( C.) but only “and they did not comply.” Grabe supplies the rest. H.  
**8** *Brought;* or “will bring,” seems preferable. What does the history of God’s people till the captivity exhibit, but scenes of disorder and of succeeding misery? C.  
**9** *Conspiracy.* They are leagued together to do evil, with all earnestness. S. Jer.  
**10** **Ver** **.** **10** **.** *To them*, for a long time. Yet they must not despair, or have recourse to idols, (v. 12) or witches. 1 K. 28.  
**13** *Confusion.* Thus he contemptuously denotes *Baalim.* C. 3:24. C.—Various idols were objects of adoration, ( H.) so that no city or street, perhaps not any house, was pure. C. 7:18 and 44:17. Is. 65:11. Ezec. 16:25.  
**15** *Beloved,* *dilectus* *.* Heb. and Sept. have the fem. Chal. “people.” They presumptuously thought that they would be freed from all their abominations, by partaking of the sacrifices. C.—But the offerings of such are not accepted. M.—The flesh is holy, but is of no service to the obstinate sinner. W.  
**16** *Burnt*, by lightning. The olive was a most useful and beautiful tree.  
**18** *Shewedst me.* He insinuates that something more than what appears must be understood. Theod.—All Christians explain what follows of Jesus Christ, (S. Jer. W.) whom Jeremias prefigured in his sufferings. C.—“Let us follow the rule which shews that all the prophets did most things for a type of our Lord and Saviour; and what was now done by Jeremias, foreshewed what would happen to our Lord.” S. Jer.  
**19** *Meek:* pet lamb. The Arabs still keep one in their houses. 2 K. 12:3. Bochart ii. 46. C.—*Knew.* I acted as if I had been ignorant. M.—Yet Christ foretold his sufferings. Mat. 20:18. &c. W.—*Bread.* Christ, *the bread of life*, was nailed to the disgraceful *wood.* S. Jer. S. Greg. Mor. iii. 12.—They threaten to beat him, (De Dieu) or to mix a poisonous wood with his food. C. M.—Some Jews had corrupted this text in S. Justin’s time. D.  
**20** *Sabaoth.* That is, of hosts or armies; a name frequently given to God, in the Scriptures.—*Thy revenge.* This was rather a prediction of what was to happen, with an approbation of the divine justice, than an imprecation. Ch.—He speaks of the impenitent, (S. Jer.) and wishes they may be converted.  
**21** *Life.* What precedes, was spoken concerning the prophet, though it regarded Christ also in a proper but more elevated sense. C.  
**23** *Remains.* All these priests shall perish. Ps. 36:28. H.—He speaks of the wicked, as a remnant was still left. C. 4. Is. 10. W.  

---

## Chapter 12

**1** *Is just.* Heb. “judgment.” Sept. “I will make my apology to thee.” Jeremias had been grievously persecuted by his countrymen: he therefore mentions a subject which has been the source of much perplexity. The success of the wicked is a temptation for *weak* souls. See Job 21. Ps. 72:3. Hab. 1:13. C.—The prophets often speak in their names, not being ignorant or doubtful of the justice of divine providence. W.  
**2** *Reins.* They have thy name in their mouth, but not in their heart. Is. 29:13. Mat. 15:8.  
**3** *Gather.* God orders his prophet to announce the misery of the wicked.  
**4** *Mourn?* Is not this a proof of my providence in chastising Juda? This famine is specified C. 8:13 and 14:4. C.—*Last end.* Two letters seem to be transposed in Heb. as the Sept. read “ways.” Kennicott.—The impious blaspheme as if all were ruled by chance. C.  
**5** *Horses.* If thou hast been terrified at the threats of thy fellow-citizens, how wilt thou withstand those of Jerusalem? ( M.) or he speaks to Juda, who would not be able to resist the Chaldees, since the Philistines, &c. had routed the Jews, though destitute of cavalry.—*Jordan*, or the nations of Ammon, &c. on that side. C.—Prot. “if in the land of peace, *wherein* thou trustedst, *they wearied thee*, then how wilt,” &c. H.  
**6** *To thee.* Edom, &c. made a league with Sedecias, which they broke. They always bore a hatred to the Jews, though sprung from the same stock. C. 27:1. Lam. 4:21. C.  
**7** *Soul;* people, ( H.) whose punishment was decreed. Say not, therefore, that the wicked always prosper.  
**9** *As a.* Sept. “a den of the hyena:” Alex. “robbers.” Grabe inserts, “or a den around it?” H.—They have read *auss*, “a den,” instead of *hait*, “a bird.” Bochart, (iii. 11.) however, shews that the latter word denotes various wild beasts, and nearly follows the Sept. Though the inheritance be most charming, it shall not pass unpunished. C.  
**10** *Pastors;* princes of my people, as well ( H.) as of the Chaldees. C. 6:3.  
**11** *Heart*, to seek God and the cause of their misfortunes.  
**13** *Fruits.* They shall not satisfy your expectations or wants.  
**14** *Land.* Nabuchodonosor led the Ammonites, &c. into captivity, five years after the Jews. Jos. Ant. x. 11. C.—After the children are chastised, the rod is burnt. W.  
**15** *Land;* the Jews, as well as their neighbours. C. 49:6. M. Is. 23:15. Ezec. 16:55.  
**16** *People.* After the captivity, converts were more cherished. Yet the predictions concerning the call of the Gentiles were accomplished only by the preaching of the gospel. C.  

---

## Chapter 13

**1** *Girdle*, usually worn by women. S. Jer. Ex. 28:42.—It denoted the Jews, who became more corrupt during the captivity; (v. 7. 11) so that God delivered them out of his pure mercy. Thus He explains this prophetical action. C.—*Loins.* God cherished his people. M.—*Water.* He made choice of them when they were rough and deformed. S. Jer.—Their sins cause their ruin. H.  
**4** *Euphrate* *s*, above 150 leagues distant. Some think this was only to be done in spirit: but it is generally supposed that the prophet made this long journey twice. Bochart suggests that Euphrates (Heb. Peratha) may be put for Ephrata, or Bethlehem, as the first syllable is often cut off. C.—Yet a journey to the Euphrates would represent more strikingly the destination of the people; and it would not be difficult for God to convey Jeremias thither in a short time, if requisite, as he sent Habacuc through the air to carry a dinner to Daniel; (14:32) though this supposition is not here necessary, as the labour to which Jeremias was repeatedly exposed, might shew the people their manifold transgressions and captivities. H.—Such prophetic actions make a deeper impression than words. Heb. 1. The ingratitude of the people is here described, to C. 21. W.  
**9** *Rot.* I will bring them low. M.—They shall see that all their dependance must be on the divine mercy.  
**11** *Glory;* that they might serve me for the edification of the world.  
**12** *Bottle*, of earthen ware. C. 25:27. C.—Every man shall suffer. v. 13. H.—This is another prophetical similitude denoting extreme perplexity. W.—*Do.* They deride the prophet, as if he said nothing worthy of notice. M.  
**16** *Dark.* Jo. 12:35.—*Mountains*, beyond the Euphrates, resembling clouds.  
**17** *My soul.* Jeremias can do no more. C.—Sept. “your soul, … your eyes,” &c. H.  
**18** *Queen;* Nohesta, mother of Joachim, or to the consort of Sedecias. C.—Sept. “to the princes.” H.  
**19** *South*, belonging to Juda; ( C.) or Egypt will afford no protection. Tournemine. C. 37:3. 10.  
**20** *North:* ye Chaldees. H.—Heb. and Sept. “see those who come.”—*Cattle.* O king, what account wilt thou give of the people to the Almighty? C.  
**21** *Head.* Achaz called the Assyrians into the country, and Ezechias had shewn his treasures to the Babylonians. Other kings excited God’s indignation.  
**22** *Defiled.* Thou art exposed to the brutality of the soldiers.  
**23** **Ver** **.** **23** **.** *Evil.* Bad habits are a sort of second nature. I speak in vain. C.—Yet God sometimes converts inveterate sinners, who cannot rise of themselves. W.  
**26** *Appeared.* Thou art treated as a wretched and vile captive. H.  
**27** *Me;* to serve me. M.  

---

## Chapter 14

**1** *Drought*, during the last siege, (v. 18. S. Jer.) or after the captivity of Jechonias; (C. 8:13) though the famine might happen in the days of Josias. Joel 1. C.—This scourge was in punishment of sin, and signified the privation of grace. W.  
**3** *Water.* Siloe was the only spring near, and it was often dry, (S. Jer.) though it was formerly abundant, (Jos. Bel. vi. 6.) as well as the fountain of Gehon. The city was furnished with cisterns. C.—But all was now dry. H.—*Heads;* mourning. 2 K. 15:30.  
**5** *Field.* They prefer places frequented by men. Pliny viii. 32.  
**6** *Win* *d*, for refreshment.—*Failed*, through want, though they be very piercing.  
**7** *Sake.* We have the honour to be called thy people. We urge no merit of our own.  
**8** *Lodge.* The Fathers apply this to our Saviour, in a spiritual sense. C.  
**9** *Wandering.* Sept. “sleeping;” ( H.) or as a boaster, who thinks himself strong. W.—*Upon us.* Shall strangers rule over thy people?  
**10** *Rested.* They are inconstant, fond of novelties, and apply to idols.  
**11** *Good*, that the drought may be removed. C. See C. 7:16 and 11:14. M.—“It is folly to pray for him who has sinned unto death,” (S. Jer. 1 Jo. v. 16) by final impenitence. C.—Sacrifices will not benefit the impenitent. S. Jer.  
**13** *Ah.* Hebrew has only one exclamation, or three letters, which Aquila renders, Ah, ah, ah. C. 1:6. Ezec. 4:14. H.—Jeremias lays the blame on false prophets. C.—Yet they afford no excuse to thy followers. Both fall into the ditch. W.  
**17** *My.* Sept. “your eyes.” Jeremias shews by his tears the future misery. C.—*Virgin.* Though many were sinners, the Church had some just souls. W.  
**18** *Famine.* Under Jechonias many were slain, and the chiefs carried into captivity. 4 K. 24:12.—*Into.* Heb. “through the land, and are ignorant.” Chal. “they apply to their business, to earthly concerns, and care not.” C. 5:31.  
**21** *Glory;* heaven, the temple or Jerusalem. How will infidels blaspheme!  
**22** *Rain.* Let not the people have recourse to idols, ( C.) in despair. H.

## Chapter 15

**1** *If.* The Geneva Bible reads corruptly, “Though Moses … stood,” contrary to Heb. and Gr. W.—*And Samuel.* These two had shewn a particular love for the people. Ex. 32 and 2 K. 12. C.—Ezechiel (14:4) specifies Noe, Daniel, and Job, who were eminent for sanctity. Daniel was still alive. Yet God will not grant their request; and he forbids his prophet to pray for those who were resolved not to repent. C. 14:11. H.—Their punishment was fixed, and God will not remit it at the request either of the living or of the dead. Hence it is evident, that the dead could and did sometimes make intercession, otherwise they would not here be mentioned. To evade this argument, Prot. in the Geneva Bible, suppose God’s “meaning *to be*, that if there were any man living, moved with so great zeal towards the people as were these two, yet he would not grant their request, for so much as he had determined the contrary.” Yet surely Jeremias, Daniel, &c. had a similar zeal; and therefore the text speaks of Moses and Samuel in a state of happiness, where their charity is greater than in this life, as S. Jer. S. Chrys. (hom. 1. in 1 Thess.) and S. Greg. (Mor. ix. 12.) explain it. W.—Jeremias had been praying earnestly for the people in the temple. But God answers his request with a severity rarely witnessed in Scripture, ordering him to drive the people out, or to announce that they should be thus treated. C.  
**2** *Death.* This Heb. phrase intimates that some should die by sickness, &c. W.  
**3** *Kinds* of persecutors, the sword, &c. C.  
**4** *Rage.* Heb. “agitation.” C.—Sept. “necessities.” Prot. “to be removed into all,” &c. H. This the event verified. Isai. 11:11.—*Manasses* *.* Though he obtained pardon, the people would not imitate his repentance. A dreadful warning for princes! C.—“The people generally perish by the fault of their governors.” S. Jer.  
**5** *Peace.* All will abhor thee. C.—“The creatures cannot be so clement as the Creator.” S. Jer.  
**6** *Intreating thee.* Heb. “of being intreated;” (S. Jer.) or, “of repenting,” and suspending the effects of my wrath. C.—Sept. “I will no longer spare them.” H.  
**7** *Will*, or “have scattered” the ten tribes, and many of Juda, before the last siege. C.  
**8** *Man*, or “a spoiler of the young man,” ( H.) so that the *widow* shall also be deprived of her children. Heb. “the young spoiler,” Nabuchodonosor. He shall not come like a night thief, to attack the metropolis.  
**9** *Seven:* many. It is not common for a mother to lose so numerous a family; yet such shall be the misfortune of Jewish parents. The synagogues shall decrease.—*Day.* Her prosperity shall end on a sudden. C.  
**10** *Strife.* Jeremias was under continual persecution, ( M.) yet ceased not to reprimand the wicked. H.—*Obsequium amicos, veritas odium parit* *.* Cic.—*Usury.* Such people are exposed to contention. M.  
**11** *Remnant;* posterity, ( C.) or rather possessions, as the prophet never married. C. 16:2. H.—God assures him that he shall be protected. M.—The Chaldees treated him with respect. C. 39:2 and 40:1. Sedecias and the people had often recourse to him. Chal. “They will come to intreat thee, when the enemy shall straiten them.” C.  
**12** *Iro* *n.* Shall the *iron* (that is, the strength of Juda) stand against the stronger iron of the north, (that is, of Babylon) or enter into an alliance upon equal footing with it? No, certainly; but it must be broken by it. Ch.—Iron is not easily united with brass, though Pliny (xxxiv. 4.) mentions a statue of this nature. Neither iron nor brass can stand against steel, which is meant by the iron from the north. The Jews shall not hurt Jeremias, v. 20. C. 1:17. C.—Prot. “shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?” The *riches* of Juda shall become a prey, v. 13. H.—Stronger kingdoms easily oppress their weak allies. W.  
**14** *Bring.* Sept. “enslave thee to thy,” &c. Chal. “thou shalt serve.” H.—They have read ( C.) hahabadti. Heb. has *r* instead of *d*, “I will make *thee* to pass with thine enemies into a,” &c. Prot. H.  
**15** *Patience.* That is, let not thy patience and long suffering, which thou usest towards sinners, keep thee from making haste to my assistance. Ch.—He is actuated by a zeal for God’s glory. C.—He is afraid of his own weakness, and begs to be delivered shortly. Ps. 12:2. W.  
**16** *Eat them.* I received them most cordially, (Ezec. 3:1. H.) as one who is hungry.—*Upon me* *.* I was recognized as the prophet of the Lord.  
**17** *Jesters*, who deride religion, (Ps. 1:1) or sport away their time. C.—*Hand*, through vanity. Lit. and I boast of.” H.—I rejoiced in suffering, as this prophet. Many ( C.) supply *nor* from the former part of the sentence. M.—*Threats.* I could not refrain from admonishing the people of their ways, ( H.) which I would not countenance by my presence. C.—All indeed kept at a distance from me.  
**18** *Trusted.* It is not cured as soon as might be expected. H.—It continually breaks out again, ( M.) like a bog not properly drained. H.—Heb. “Thou art become,” &c. Chal. “break not thy promise, as,” &c. Do not reject me when I stand most in need of redress. C.—My hopes seem ( H.) vain. W.  
**19** *Converted*, and cease to fear the people; ( C.) and confide in my *precious* words, ( H.) despising the *vile* threats of the people. M.—*Mouth;* interpreter. Ex. 4:16. Chal. “If thou wilt recall the wicked into the way of justice, though shalt fulfill my will.” See S. Jer. in Ps. cv. 32.—*To thee.* Thus Sedecias and the people acted, C. 21:1 and 42:2. C.—The prophet must not give way to sinners, but hey must be reclaimed. W.  
**21** *Mighty;* Chaldees. Providence watched over Jeremias, amid all his enemies. C.

## Chapter 16

**2** *Place.* It was going to be destroyed, and the cares of a family might interrupt the prophet. The Fathers believe that Jeremias never married, (see S. Jer. in C. xxii. Isidor.) which was then a rare example. C.—He always lived a single life, and not only in time of tribulation. S. Jer. c. Jov. 1. W.—The Church enforces this *law of God* for her sacred ministers, in subdeacons and the higher orders. S. Paul shews the propriety of such a regulation, (1 Cor. 7) which innovators deem unnatural and tyrannical. How then could God enforce it once? With his grace we may observe celibacy like Jeremias. H.  
**4** *Illnesses*, denoting God’s wrath. S. Jer.—*Earth.* The privation of sepulture was accounted one of the greatest evils.  
**5** *Feasting:* usual at burials for all relations. C.—This custom reduced many to poverty. Jos. Bel. ii. 1.—  
**6** *Cut.* Moses prohibited this being done in honour of Adonis. Lev. 19:27. Deut. 14:1. Ezec. 27:31. “The custom of cutting the arms and hair still subsists in Judea,” says S. Jerom; and in other countries. Plut. Herodot. iv. 71.  
**7** *Cup.* Most exquisite things were sent on such occasions. Buxtorf, Syn. xxxv. Prov. 31:6. Tob. 4:18. John 11:19.  
**8** *Feasting.* Heb. “of drinking,” in times of joy.  
**12** *Fathers* *.* Hence you are justly partakers of their punishment. Mat. 23:32. C.—A continuance in sin brings on severe punishments; after which, God again shews mercy. W.  
**13** Gods. Elohim, “masters,” &c. C. 17:4. Chal. “idolatrous nations.”  
**15** *Fathers.* He joins consolation with distressing predictions, and alludes to the redemption of mankind, of which the return of the Jews was the most striking pledge.  
**16** *Rocks.* They shall be found in all their lurking places. Ezec. 12:12. Hab. 1:4. C.—The apostles shall save them. Orig.—The Medes and Persians shall grant them liberty; or rather Nabuchodonosor shall *fish* at first, and afterwards *hunt* or destroy more of the Jews. C.—Apostolical men ( W.) shall be like rocks, (S. Jer.) for the protection of their hearers.  
**18** *Double:* enormous. H. C. 17:18.—I will punish them doubly.—*Carcasses.* So he styles the victims, or idols, the representations of dead men.  
**19** *Them.* After the captivity many were converted. Esth. 8 and 1 Esd. 6:21. Edom was forced to receive circumcision. But this was nothing in comparison with the crowds which embraced the gospel.  
**20** *Make gods.* This consideration alone suffices to shew their absurdity. C.—“Man must now be merciful to god!” Tert. Apol.—No one can make even a man, much less a god. S. Jer. W.  
**21** *Power*, in taking vengeance on idolatry.—*Lord.* “He who is;” ( C.) *Jehova.* H.

## Chapter 17

**1** *The.* Grabe (de Vit. p. 8.) observes that the four first verses were omitted in the Sept. by some careless transcriber, long before the days of Origen, who restored them from the Heb. and the other Gr. versions. On such occasions his work was very useful; but the marks being soon neglected, great confusion ensued. S. Jer. Kennicott, Dis. ii.—Grabe has restored these verses in his edition. H.—Eusebius (Dem. x.) and Theodoret acknowledged them; and Nobilius found the first verse thus expressed in many copies, ( C.) as it is in Grabe: “The sin of Juda is expressed in writing with a *finger* nail of adamant, cleaving to the breast of,” &c. H.—*Altars*, to appear more conspicuously to the latest times. This excited God’s indignation. C.—These figurative expressions shew the inveterate malice of the people. W.  
**3** *Sin* of idolatry. C. 15:13.  
**4** *Be left.* Prot. “discontinue from thine,” &c. H.—The land shall have its sabbaths, which thou wouldst not allow. Chal. Ex. 22:11. Lev. 26:34.  
**5** *Thus.* Sept. continue from the last chapter, “cursed,” &c. H.—Sedecias had formed alliances with several princes, instead of turning to the Lord. C. 27 and 37. C.—Our chief dependence must be on God, not on human policy. W.  
**6** Tamaric. A barren shrub, that grows in the driest parts of the wilderness. Ch.—Harhar denotes some sort ( H.) of “useless wood.” Sym. See C. 48:6. Isai. 17:2.—*Salt*, like the environs of Sodom, the fruits of which were bad.  
**8** *Fruit.* See Ps. 1:3. Pindar, Nem. viii. How different from the wicked! C.  
**9** *Perverse.* Sept. “deep.”—*Unsearchable* *.* Sept. “man, who shall know him?” H.—God alone can search the heart by his own power. He enables saints to do it by the light of glory, or of prophecy; as Eliseus and S. Peter knew secret transactions. W.  
**11** *Partridge.* Heb. kore, ( H.) may mean the “coucou.” The kra lays many eggs, *all of* which she does not hatch. C.—Prot. “*As* the partridge sitteth *on eggs*, and hatcheth *them* not,” &c. H.—It is rare that all produce birds; so the unjust do not succeed ( C.) in the *end.* H.  
**12** *Throne.* The temple. We may also read “O high,” &c. C. 14:21.  
**13** *Earth*, where alone their portion shall be, (Apoc. 3:5,) or they shall be forgotten. It is a proverbial expression, like that of Catullus:  
**15** *Come.* We have several instances of such impious sarcasms. Isa. 28:10 and 34:13. Amos 2:12. Mic. 2:6. C.—We fear not the Chaldees. M.  
**16** *Tr* *oubled.* Heb. “in haste to be a pastor after thee.” Chal. “I delay not, at thy command, to announce thy truths to them.” C. 1:6. Jeremias was aware of the dangers attending his office, yet not dismayed.—*Day:* approbation, (1 Cor. 4:3) or advantages of the world. C.—*Of man.* Heb. also, “of the wretched:” *anush.* I wished rather for the people’s welfare, ( H.) and sought not their ruin. Chal. Theodor.  
**18** **Ve** **r.** **18** **.** *Let them be confounded*, &c. Such expressions as these in the writings of the prophets, are not to be understood as imprecations proceeding from malice or desire of revenge, but as prophetic predictions of evils that were about to fall upon impenitent sinners, and approbations of the ways of the divine justice. Ch.—The prophet has already prevented this objection. v. 16. H.  
**19** *Gate* of the palace, or that by which the kings entered the temple, on the west. The time when this admonition was given is not ascertained.  
**21** *Souls.* Those who broke the sabbath were to die. Ex. 30:15. Num. 15:32.—*Burdens*, or servile work. C.—The Jews trifle in deciding what is a burden. Orig. prin. 4:2.—Sabbath often denotes the observance of the whole law. W.  
**25** *David.* I will observe my covenant. 2 K. 7:12.—*Horses:* in prosperity, ( M.) provided this law, as well as all the rest, be observed. H.—Such temporal rewards were commonly proposed under the law, as spiritual ones are now. W.  
**26** *Sacrifices.* Heb. mincha, ( H.) “offerings” of flour, wine, &c. C.  
**27** *Fire*, by means of Nabuzardan. M.—The city shall be entirely destroyed. C.

## Chapter 18

**2** *Potter’s.* Thus God would shew his dominion over all. Rom. 9:21.  
**3** *Wheel.* Heb. “stones.” Sept. “seats;” or “wheel.” Chal. Ex. 1:16. See Eccle. 38:32. C.  
**4** *Broken.* So Providence ordered it. S. Jer.—How should this idea humble man! C.—A potter may mould afresh the clay as long as it is soft, but God can change the hardest heart. W.  
**8** *Shall repent*, having free-will, though prevented by grace. S. Jer.  
**12** *Hopes.* C. 2:25. Sept. “we are valiant men.” H.  
**13** *Virgin.* The disorders of Israel are thus enhanced. C.  
**14** *Snow.* It continues on *Libanus* seven or eight months, (La Roque quoted. Univ. Hist. ii. p. 363) or all the year; (Tacit. Hist. v. 6.) and hence the mountain is justly denominated “white,” as the Alps and Albion are from *albon.* Bochart. Parkhurst, p. 155. H.—*Away.* Yet my people abandon me, to serve idols! Heb. may have many other senses to the same purpose. Sept. “Shall the mountain springs fail, or snow from Libanus? Shall a stream forcibly driven by the wind, turn aside?” H.—The laws of nature are observed by inanimate things, and shall my people be so foolish as to follow mere vanity.  
**15** *Ancient;* followed by the patriarchs. C. 6:16.  
**16** *Head*, through contempt ( C.) and pity. Lam. 2:15.  
**17** *Burning.* Heb. kadim, “eastern,” ( H.) coming from Desert Arabia. Ex. 10:13. C.—*Back.* Thus the Lord now treats the synagogue. S. Jer.  
**18** *Prophet.* Jeremias will not cease to upbraid us with our transgressions; or we have guides as good as him, and we shall not be left destitute, as he would intimate.—*Tongue*, detraction; or make him suffer for what he says. In all the transactions of this prophet, Christ was foreshewn; ( C.) and here, particularly, the Jews demand the crucifixion. S. Jer. W.  
**20** *Remember*, &c. This is spoken in the person of Christ, persecuted by the Jews, and prophetically denouncing the evils that should fall upon them in punishment for their crimes. Ch.—Jeremias had prayed earnestly for the people. C. 14:17. H.  
**21** *Therefore.* He foretells of the event, and approves of the chastisement of the impenitent, ( C.) whose “impurity might be a bad precedent for others. S. Jer. See C. 17:18.  
**22** *For.* Prot. “when.” H.—*Robber.* So Nabuchodonosor and all professional conquerors are styled. C.  
**23** *Destroy.* Heb. “with them.” use them as vessels of ignominy: *abutere* *.* H.  

---

## Chapter 19

**1** *Priests.* They were to furnish the vessel, and accompany the prophets. v. 10. Sept. “and thou shalt take some of,” &c. H.—Words and actions together instruct most powerfully. S. Jer. W.  
**2** *Gate*, which must have been to the south-east of Jerusalem, leading to the valley. C.—Sept. “Charseith gate.” H.—Here the common people were buried, after the reign of Josias, who contaminated the place where the idol Moloc had been adored.  
**3** *Tingle*, as if he had heard a sudden noise or clap of thunder. C.  
**4** *Profaned.* Lit. “rendered strange.” H.—I have no farther regard for it.—*Innocents:* their own children. v. 5. C. 7:31.  
**5** *Mind.* Perhaps the people stupidly thought thus to honour him; but God pointedly condemns such sacrifices.  
**6** *Valley.* Sept. “burial-place of slaughter.” v. 2. Here the Chaldees slew many.  
**9** *Sons*, to punish them for their cruel sacrifices. S. Jer.—This was verified under Sedecias. Lam. 2:10 and 4:10. Ezec. 5:10.  
**11** *Again.* The captives indeed returned, so that this must not be urged too much. C.—Yet the Romans strictly fulfilled this prophecy, (S. Jer. Sanctius) and the city was built in another place, and styled Ælia. H.—God can perform what is impossible to man. C. 18:3. Mat. 19. W.  
**13** *Topheth.* This sentence was not in S. Jerom’s Hebrew copy, but in the Sept. ( C.) with some variations: ( H.) “All the houses of the kings of Juda, like the place of Topheth,” is added by the Sept. S. Jer.—In Grabe they agree with the present Heb. and Chal. only rendering, “shall be as a place in ruin, for the defilements in all,” &c. H.—*Of heaven:* the moon, &c. 4 K. 23:12. Josias could not entirely root out this impiety. C. 32:29. His wicked son Joachaz or Sellum, was probably now on the throne, when the prophet went to the *potter*, &c. C. 18 to 21.  
**14** *People.* Many still resorted to the temple. C.  

---

## Chapter 20

**1** *Son*, or descendant. His father was Melchia. C. 21:1 and 1 Par. 9:12. C.—*Chief:* high priest, (Theod.) or rather a chief officer, (C. 29:25) or *prince*, (Matt. 26:27. Tolet. Grot.) whose duty it was to take up impostors. He treated Jeremias in this light. C.—See Lu. 22:52. H.  
**2** *Struck*, or seized. Grot.—*Upper gate*, nearer the temple. C.  
**3** *Phassur* *.* This name signifies, *i* *ncrease* and *principality;* and therefore is here changed to Magor-Missabib, or “fear on every side,” to denote the evils that should come upon him in punishment of his opposing the word of God. Ch.—Aquila renders *Posseur*, “a stranger,” and S. Jer. “blackness of visage.” H.—It may also mean, “one who causes paleness.” C.—*Mogur* may signify “fear *or* distress.” Sept. and Syr. “an exile.” H.—He deserved to be thus treated. v. 6. C.—He would be terrified by many enemies. W.  
**6** *Lie.* He was therefore a false prophet, and vexed that Jeremias should contradict him. C.  
**7** *Thou hast deceived*, &c. The meaning of the prophet is not to charge God with any untruth; but what he calls *deceiving*, was only the concealing from him, when he accepted of the prophetical commission, the greatness of the evils which the execution of that commission was to bring upon him. Ch.—Heb. “thou hast enticed me,” when I declined the office. T.—God never promised that he should suffer no persecution. H.—Jeremias might also have supposed that he was to be sent to the Gentiles. C. 1:5. S. Jer. in C. xxv. 18.—The oriental languages are much more lofty than ours, and express common things in the strongest manner. C.—We may perceive the different emotions of fear and joy ( D.) with which the prophet was actuated, like S. Paul, and our Saviour himself. The saints evince the weakness of man and the power of divine grace. C.—Heb. “If thou, Lord, hast deceived me, I am,” &c. Tournemine.  
**8** *Day.* They keep asking where are these enemies from the north, the plagues? &c. C.—He is sorry to see the word of God despised, (Theod.) and is guilty of a venial pusillanimity, concluding that his words had no good effect. M.  
**9** *And there*, or “for,” &c. I was grieved continually. Sanctius.—I could not however refrain from speaking. Acts 17:16 and 1 Cor. 9:16. Job 32:18.  
**10** *Side*, seeking an opportunity to ruin me, as the Pharisees did our Saviour. Ps. 40:10. C.—Prot. “familiars watched for my halting, *s* *aying*, peradventure he,” &c. H.  
**12** *Let me see*, &c. This prayer proceeded not from hatred or ill-will, but zeal of justice. Ch.—He expresses in a human manner a future punishment.  
**13** *Sing.* God having shewn that his prayer should be heard, he gives thanks, ( C.) and thus shews that what he is going to say proceeds not from impatience. Theod.  
**14** *Cursed*, &c. In these and the following words of the prophet, there is a certain figure of speech to express with more energy the greatness of the evils to which his birth had exposed him. Ch.—The wicked would deem the day of his birth *cur* *sed*, or unlucky. M.—Jeremias was now in prison, (Grot.) and people in pain express themselves forcibly, particularly in the East. v. 7. Job 3:2. C.—Perhaps no *man* had announced the tidings of his birth, or he might be no longer living to feel the effects of a curse: as the *day* was certainly irrevocably past. H.  
**16** *Repented*, is decree for the ruin of Sodom being fixed.—*Noon.* This is more extraordinary than at midnight. Let him always be terrified with dismal sounds. C.  
**17** *Who.* Sept. “because he (the Lord. D. T.) slew me not in my mother’s womb.” H.—Syr. Grot. &c. explain the Heb. in the same sense, though it may also agree with the Vulg. *from the womb*, or as soon as I was born. O that I had never seen the light! C.—He abstracts from the effects of original sin. T.—It is better not to exist than to be in constant misery. Mat. 26. S. Jer. W.—The prophet bewailed the abuse which was made of God’s word, by unbelievers. v. 8. H.

## Chapter 21

**1** *Sent*, after Nabuchodonosor had returned from Egypt. A. 3415. This consultation should be placed after C. 37. C.—*Phassur*, specified above, and C. 38:1. ( C.) or a different person. S. Jer. Pisc.—*Sophonias, the second priest*, (C. 37:3 and 52:24) of the 24th class, (1 Par. 24:18) who was slain at Reblatha. C.—Jeremias threatens the great ones to C. 29 and is persecuted. He spoke this when Nabuchodonosor invaded the country. W.  
**4** *City.* The people shall turn their arms against each other; or rather the Chaldees shall use their weapons to destroy them. C.  
**6** *Pestilence.* Sept. “death;” the sword, and various diseases. H.  
**7** *To them.* This was verified, C. 52 and 4 K. 24.  
**8** *Death;* the former if they submit, the latter if they fight, v. 9. C.—God’s grace is ever ready, that sinners may be converted. W.  
**9** *Spoil.* He shall be happy to escape naked. C. 38:3. C.  
**13** *Valley.* He speaks to Jerusalem, confiding in the strength of her situation, upon rocks, surrounded with a deep valley. Ch.—Lit. “valley, solid and in a plain.” H.—Isaias (22:1) styles it ironically, “the valley of vision.” C.—Jerusalem was situated on many rocks. Jos. Bel. vi. 6.  
**14** **Ver** **.** **14** **.** *Doings.* Heb. “studies.” So “Your studious pursuits” occurs, v. 12, in many Heb. MSS. though the printed copy have, “their;” and “spoiled” for *apprised.* Kennicott.—*Forest*, the temple, which is called Libanus, (Zac. 11:2) and the houses built of cedar-wood, (4 K. 25:9. C.) particularly the royal palace of the *forest.* 3 K. 7. H.  

---

## Chapter 22

**1** *Go.* The contents of this chapter are of a more ancient date than those of the foregoing chapter; for the order of time is not always observed in the writings of the prophets. Ch. W.—*King* Joakim, who succeeded Sellum, A. 3394. Usher.  
**5** *Myself*, having none greater. Heb. 6:13. Oaths evince the insincerity of men, who distrust each other; but when God condescends to use them, it shews men’s incredulity.—*House*, the temple, or rather the palace, where the king was sitting at the gate, v. 2. C.  
**6** *Galaad, the head of Libanus.* By Galaad, a rich and fruitful country, is here signified the royal palace of the kings of the house of David; by Libanus, a high mountain abounding in cedar-trees, the populous city of Jerusalem. Ch. W. Theodor.—Both mountains are connected. S. Jer. Strabo xvi.—Yet the proper Galaad was at some distance, and on the side of Ammon very barren. The palaces had arisen from a miserable state to resemble Libanus. They shall surely be destroyed. C.—The advantageous situation of Jerusalem should not protect it, no more than it had done Galaad. 4 K. 15:29. Jun. Grot.  
**7** *Prepare.* Lit. *sanctify;* ( Ch.) as various religious ceremonies were used before the declaration of war, and to know what would be the success. C.—The Chaldees were destined to execute God’s decrees. S. Jer.—*Cedars;* fine buildings, (v. 14. C.) and chiefs. H.  
**10** *Dead* *.* He means the good king Josias, who by death was taken away, so as not to see the miseries of his country.—*Away.* Sellum, alias Joschaz, who was carried captive to Egypt. Ch. v. 12 and 4 K. 23:33. C.—He was the fourth son of Josias, (1 Par. 3:15) and had probably the title of king after the death of Sedecias. W.  
**13** *Friend.* Joakim forced his subjects to work for him for nothing.  
**14** *Wide* *.* Heb. “measured;” large, and well-proportioned.—*Vermilion*, (cynopide.) This colour was invented in the town of Pontus, and was used for statues, &c. Pliny xxxiii. 6. and xxxv. 6. Wisd. 13:14. C.—Heb. shashar ( H.) may mean indigo. Jun. C.  
**15** *Cedar;* Josias. C.—Shall thy magnificent palaces secure thy empire? H.—*Him.* Obey the Lord, in like manner, that thou mayst prosper.  
**18** *Sister.* They shall not condole with his consort.  
**19** *Jerusalem.* C. 36:30. He died indeed *with* or like *his fathers.* 4 K. 24:6. But it is not said that he was buried. S. Jer.—The Chaldees designed to send him to Babylon, (2 Par. 36:6) but slew him on the road, (Usher, A. 3405) or treated his corpse ignominiously after his arrival. Grot.  
**20** *Go;* Jerusalem. The verbs are feminine.—*Lovers;* citizens, or Egyptians, &c. C. 27:2.  
**22** *Pastors*, or princes, whose expectations of aid will be frustrated. Osee 12:1. Chal. “Thy leaders shall be scattered to all the winds.”  
**24** *Jechonias:* Joachin, (4 K. 24:6. W.) or Chenias, who did not take warning by his predecessor’s misfortune.—*Ring*, or seal, if he were most dear to me, the prime minister of the greatest monarch. Agg. 2:24. C.—Alexander gave his ring to Perdiccas, designating him his successor, or regent. Curt. x.  
**26** *Mother;* Nohesta, (4 K. 24:8) who perverted, ( C.) or did not correct him in his youth. H.  
**27** *Mind;* ardently desiring and expecting to be liberated. C.  
**28** *Jechonias.* Prot. “Koniah, a despised broken idol? *is* he,” &c. Sept. Alex. “Jechonias has been dishonoured as a vessel, or which there is no need, for he hath been snatched and cast,” &c. H.  
**30** *Write this man barren.* That is childless: not that he had no children, but that his children should never sit on the throne of Juda. Ch. 5:28. Mat. 1:12. Ezec. 17:24. Zorobabel was of his seed, yet he never obtained the title or sovereign power of a king. The Machabees were of a different family. S. Jer.—Joachin, or Jechonias, was restored indeed to some favour, (4 K. 25:27) but not to the kingdom, no more than any of his posterity, till Christ. W.

## Chapter 23

**1** *Pastors.* Successors of Josias ( C.) and false prophets. M.  
**3** *Multiplied.* The prophets subjoin tidings of peace to such as might cause affliction. Theodoret.  
**4** **Ver.** **4–5** **.** *Pastors;* Zorobabel, &c. as figures of Christ, and of the pastors of his Church.—*No more*, as much as formerly. So many expressions must be understood.—*Branch.* Sept. “orient.”—*Reign.* Zorobabel was not chief governor, ( C.) though at the head of his tribe. H.—The kingdom of Christ was not of this world. Jo. 18:36. C.—He alone imparts justice to others. W.  
**6** *Saved:* less disturbed. The world shall be redeemed. Lu. 2:14. Eph. 2:14.—*Just.* Heb. “Justice,” by whom we are made just. He is the true God. Col. 2:9. 14. No man could bear this title: and Grotius insidiously attempts to apply it to the Jews, though the Chal. &c. clearly speak of the Messias. He must be read with great caution. C.—Sept. “This is his name, which the Lord will call him, Josedech. In the prophets. 9. My,” &c. H.—*Josedech* means “the Lord justice.” C.—Sym. “Lord, justify us.”  
**8** *Land.* The deliverance from Egypt and Babylon were emblems of man’s redemption, which was accomplished by far greater miracles.  
**9** *Prophets* of falsehood. He directs his discourse to them, and afterwards to the priests, being filled with amazement at their impending ruin.  
**10** *Adulterers;* impostors or idolaters.—*Cursing* of the Lord, or the abuse of his sacred name. C.—*Unlike.* Heb. “not right.” H.  
**11** *Defiled.* Heb. “hypocrites.” My priests retain the appearance of religion, to join with impostors in deluding the people.  
**14** *Jerusalem.* These were far worse, as they pretended to be inspired by God, whereas those of Samaria publicly adhered to Baal; so that the people must have been foolish to have been deceived by them. C.  
**15** *Gall*, or something mortally bitter. C. 9:15. H.  
**16** *Own.* To rely on private judgment, and not on the Church, is a mark of falsehood. W.  
**17** *Blaspheme.* Heb. “despise;” or Sept. “reject disdainfully the word of the Lord, you,” &c. C. 6:14 and 8:11.  
**18** *Counsel.* Heb. “secret.” Which of you is acquainted with his designs? I will inform you, that your perdition is at hand. v. 20. C.  
**21** *Not send.* The want of mission proves a prophet or preacher to be false. W.  
**22** *I should.* Some copies read *avertissent*, “they would have turned,” conformably with the Heb. &c. and we should suspect that this was a mistake of the transcriber, if S. Jerom did not agree with the Vulg. in his commentary, ( C.) though not in express terms: ( H.) “I also should not have abandoned them to impurity … Let us behold *how* heretics, having once given way to despair, … seek the gratification of their sensual appetite.” S. Jer.  
**23** *Off?* Can you so easily penetrate my designs, or escape my fury? Am I like your idols of yesterday? Sept. and Theodot. “I am a God at hand,” &c. which agrees with the sequel. C.  
**27** *Dreams*, as if God had favoured them with his revelations. H.—*Fathers* *;* the false prophets of Baal, whom these imitate.  
**28** *Dream*, to those who are really sent by God, ( C.) and recognized. 1 Cor. 14:29. H.  
**29** *Pieces?* True prophets will have a zeal fo the conversion of souls. C. 20:9. Heb. 4:12.  
**30** *Neighbour*, causing those whom I have sent to be disregarded.  
**31** *Use.* Hebrew also, “sharpen, *or* render smooth,” and insinuating. Ps. 49:16. C.  
**32** **2** **.** *Wonders.* Prot. “lightness.” Sept. “frauds,” or pretended miracles. H.—False prophets cannot work true miracles: but it is more difficult to distinguish these than the former mark of being lawfully sent. v. 21. W.  
**33** *Burden,* Massa, ( H.) denotes a weight, or sometimes a prediction. C.  
**34** *Burden of the Lord.* This expression is here rejected and disallowed, at least for those times: because it was then used in mockery and contempt by the false prophets, and unbelieving people, who ridiculed the repeated threats of Jeremias under the name of his *burdens.* Ch.  
**35** *Answered.* I will make you alter your language by chastisements.  
**39** *Take.* Heb. of the Masorets, ( C.) “I, even I, will utterly forget (Prot. H.) *or* abandon you.” Chal. But the sense of the Sept. and Vulg. seems preferable. C.

## Chapter 24

**1** *Engravers.* Heb. “those who enclose.” 4 K. 24:14 and 1 K. 13:19.  
**2** *Season.* Appearing in autumn and ripe in spring. Mic. 7:1. C.  
**5** *Regard.* Lit. “know,” with love. Ps. 1:6. H.—Jechonias was treated with honour, (4 K. 25:27) as well as Daniel (2:48) and Zorobabel, of the same family. C. 29:5. The captives, under Sedecias, (v. 8) were much more abused. C. 29:17. C.—This is the literal sense; the mystical shews that the good shall be rewarded. W.  
**6** *Up*, till the Messias appear, and the true *Israel of God*, his disciples, to whom the promises chiefly pertain. They will continue for ever. If this answer does not give satisfaction, as it ought, we may say that the Jews did not comply with the condition, and were therefore abandoned to the Romans. C.  
**8** *Egypt*, to which they fled contrary to the prophet’s advice. 4 K. 25:26.

## Chapter 25

**1** *Babylon*, when he was associated by Nabopolassar, three years before his death, A. 3397. This year Joakim was taken to be conducted to Babylon, though he was afterwards permitted to remain on very hard conditions, while the sacred vessels, Daniel, &c. were taken away, and the 70 years of captivity commenced. They ended in the first of Cyrus, A. 3468. Usher—This chap. should be placed before the 24th and after the 26th. C.—The prophets did not observe the order of time. C. 21. W.  
**3** *Josias.* He prophesied nineteen years under him, and three under his successors.  
**4** *A* *ll.* We know of Joel, Habacuc, Sophonias, and Holda. C.  
**9** *My servant.* So this wicked king is here called; because God made him his instrument in punishing the sins of his people. Ch. W.—He thought himself more than man, but he was only the rod destined for the fire.  
**10** *Sound*, or songs of women turning the *mill.* Mat. 24:41. C.—*Lamp*, or illuminations, on account of some victory, ( H.) or festival. Pers. v. 180. The Jews “light a lamp for the sabbaths,” (Sen. Ep. xcv.) before they commence. H.  
**11** *Years.* Ver. 1. The neighbouring nations were also involved in this calamity, and were to be sent back by Cyrus. C.—Another period of 70 years is specified, (C. 29:10) during which the city and temple should remain in ruins, till the second of Hystaspes, A. 3485. Usher—This system is not without difficulties. The present prediction seems rather to refer to the desolation, (Vatab. Agg. 1:2) as appears from Zac. 1:12 or the prophet speaks of the same event in both places, dating from the year preceding the capture of Jerusalem, ( A. 3415), till Darius gave entire liberty to the Jews, A. 3485. We differ from Usher in the years allotted to Cyrus, who began to restore the Jews. 1 Esd. 1:5. C.—These 70 years are dated from the 11th of Sedecias. W.  
**12** *Punish.* Literally, *visit upon.* Ch.—Cyrus overturned the monarchy, and the city was ruined by degrees. Is. 13 and 14 and 21:1. Ezek. 1:5. C.  
**14** *Kings.* They perfidiously joined the Chaldees, after making a league with Sedecias. C. 27:3. This is condemned, ( C.) and not precisely their submitting to Nabuchodonosor. C. 28:8. Their league with Juda was indeed wrong; but the infringement of it was another crime. Sept. is here much transposed almost to the end. See Grabe. H.—Jeremias had prophesied against the nations, though his words are given. C. 46. &c.  
**15** *Fury.* Chastisement. Is. 51:17.—*All*, who might be then at Jerusalem. Sanctius thinks Jeremias travelled into all these countries: most believe it was only done in vision. He might write to them. C.—The *cup* metaphorically denotes God’s wrath. Ps. 74:9. W.  
**18** *As*, &c. He probably inserted this ( H.) after the event, (Vat.) or the country was much distressed even under Sedecias.  
**19** *Pharao*, who was defeated (Ezec. 30:25) coming to assist Juda, (C. 37) and again plundered after the taking of Tyre. Ezec. 29:18.  
**20** *In.* Heb. “the mixed multitude,” (Ex. 12:38. C.) or “Arabs.” Grot.—*Ausitis*, near Palmyra. Job 1:1.—*Azorus*, taken by the Egyptians, and afterwards by the Chaldees. C. 47:2.  
**21** Ammon*.* The details are given in C. 48 and 49. Ezec. 25 to 34. Abdias and Sophonias.  
**22** *Kings.* Ithobaal (Jos. Ant. x. 11.) had many governors under him. Nabuchodonosor besieged Tyre for 13 years. Ezec. 26. &c.—*Sea*, or Gibraltar. See Jos. sup. v. 22. H.—He had navies on the Mediterranean. Ezec. 30:9.  
**23** *Buz.* Scenite Arabs, who cut off the hair of the eyebrows. C. 9:26. These Saracens left the hair below the ears long, as the Polonians and Hungarians do. W.  
**25** **Ver.** **25–26** **.** *Zambri*, sprung from Cethura, and dwelling in Arabia, ( C.) or Persia, (S. Jer.) where Pliny (vi. 28.) places the Zamarenians.—*Elam.* Persians, ( H.) by the sword of Alexander, (S. Jer.) or Cyrus subdued those who were subject to the Medes, and united the two nations.—*North.* Armenia, &c. subdued by Cyrus and by Alexander.—*Brother.* When Cyrus stood up for the Persians. All shall drink, as at a feast, ( C.) of this bitter wine.—*Face*, and forming the empire of Babylon. H.—*Sesac.* That is Babel, or Babylon; which after bringing all these people under her yoke, should quickly fall and be destroyed herself. Ch.—The Chaldees are not expressed, to avoid their resentment. The sh in *sheshac*, is at the same distance from the end as *b* in *Babel* is from the beginning of the alphabet. See S. Jer. H. 2 Tim. 4:17.—Yet they are not elsewhere spared. C. 49. &c. Sesac was probably the idol, “anais or the moon.” C.—The *Sacean* feasts were very dissolute, like the saturnalia at Rome. Dio. Chrys. iv. Strabo xi. C.—Cyrus took Babylon after he had conquered the rest of Asia, and then seizing Nabonides at Borsippe, which was sacred to Anais, “the moon,” ( C.) or Diana, (Strabo xv.) suffered him to die in peace. Berosus in Jos. c. Ap. 1.—Thus fell the king of Sesac, an idol worshipped both at Borsippe and at Babylon.  
**29** *City.* Jerusalem first fell a prey.  
**30** *Beauty* *.* The temple, which was like the palace ( C.) of the great king. H.—*Grapes.* Great feasting was then customary. The soldiers rushing to battle, “answer” the Lord. Sept. C.—People encouraged one another by songs under the labour of the vine-press, as those in distress must do. W.  
**31** *Flesh.* He will justify his conduct, particularly at the last day.  
**32** *To nation.* Jerusalem, Tyre, Syria, desert Arabia, Ammon, Idumea, and Egypt, shall fall one after another. Thus Cyrus will attack the Medes, Asia, and Babylon.  
**34** *Leaders.* Sept. “rams.” He addresses the princes.—*Vessels.* Sept. “chosen rams,” fattened for slaughter.  
**37** *Silent.* The places where you fed your flocks so delightfully, are laid waste.  
**38** *The dove.* This is commonly understood of Nabuchodonosor, whose military standard, they say, was a dove. But the Hebrew word *Jonah*, which is here rendered *a dove*, may also signify a waster or oppressor, which name better agrees to that unmerciful prince; or by comparison, as a dove’s flight is the swiftest, so would their destruction come upon them. Ch.—Sept. “waste *or* impassible before the great sword. C. 4:7. H.—While God, like a lion, protected his people, none durst invade them. M.—What is said respecting the Babylonian standards is very dubious, (Grot. C.) as the same expression is applied to the Persians, (C. 50:16. M.) though it may there also be understood of the Chaldees. H.—God is like a dove, yet terrible. W.

## Chapter 26

**1** *Beginning*, after Joakim had reigned some time. v. 21.  
**2** *Word.* This example all pastors should follow, in the midst of dangers. C.  
**3** *If.* God is not ignorant, ( C.) but he preserves man’s free-will. S. Jer.—He threatens conditionally, if people persist in evil. W.  
**6** *Silo.* C. 7:12. C.—*Curse.* No greater punishment could be threatened or endured in this world. H.  
**8** **Ve** **r.** **8** **.** *Death.* The pretext was plausible, as God seemed to have promised the temple an eternal duration. 3 K. 9:3. The Jews accused Christ of the like crime. Mat. 26:61. Such questions were brought before the sanhedrim and priests. C. 26:57. But the latter are here ( C.) the chief accusers with “the false prophets.” Sept. H.—The princes, moved by the elders, (v. 17) acquit the prophet, ( C.) at the persuasion of Ahicam. v. 24. Several *priests* would probably judge along with the other princes, as the examination of impostors belonged chiefly to their tribunal. H.—*All* is often used for most part.  
**15** *Sent me.* This was a complete justification. C.—None could deny but Jeremias had all the characters of a true prophet. v. 16. H.  
**16** *All.* The populace easily changes either for better or for worse. W.  
**17** *Ancients.* They declare what happened about 100 years before, respecting Micheas. 3:12. C.  
**18** *Mountain.* Sion, on which the house of the Lord was built. Conquerors have sometimes ploughed up cities. C.—*Jam seges est ubi Troja fuit* *.* Ovid, ep. i.  
**20** *There was.* The adversaries make this reply, or the others contrast the conduct of Joakim with the piety of Ezechias.  
**23** **V** **er.** **23** **.** *Egypt*, as a seditious person … Joakim was tributary to Pharao.  
**24** *Ahicam* *.* A man employed under Josias, (4 K. 22:12) and father of Godolias, who was also the protector of Jeremias. C. 39:14 and 4 K. 25:22. C.

## Chapter 27

**1** *Joakim.* This revelation was made to the prophet in the beginning of the reign of Joakim: but the bands were not sent, to the princes here named, before the reign of Sedecias. v. 3. Ch.—He wore them six or seven years. Vat. T.—But this is uncertain. Sept. omit this title. Syr. Arab. &c. read “Sedecias.” C.—As far as *Juda* may belong to the last chapter. S. Jerom includes the whole verse. H.—It seems to be rather a fresh prophecy, or the title may be spurious, like many in the Psalms. See C. 26:1 and 28:1. Is. 21:13.  
**2** *Chains.* Heb. “a yoke and pole,” ( C.) or piece of wood for the necks of slaves. S. Jer.—Thus would the servitude of these nations be clearly represented. H.—Bands and chains were proper signs, as they were used to bind captives. W.  
**3** Edom*.* Thus he exercises the function of prophet among the nations. C. 1:5. These had come to compliment Sedecias, or rather to form a league.  
**5** *Eyes.* God disposes of all princes, &c. His prophets speak boldly. C.  
**6** *Beasts.* The property of those people, or the most barbarous nations. S. Jer.—Hangmen and executioners may in the same sense be styled God’s *servants.* W.  
**7** *His son;* viz. Evilmerodach, and his son’s son, viz. Nabonydus, or Nabonadius, the *Baltassar* of Daniel, (chap. 5) and the last of the Chaldean kings. Ch.—*Come.* It will not be long before this rod is cast into the fire, the usual fate of those who execute God’s vengeance.  
**9** *Prophets*, who deluded the Jews, as *diviners* did the Gentiles.  
**10** *To remove.* Heb. “that I may,” &c. This will be the effect, though contrary to their intention.  
**11** *In it.* None complied, and though the Idumeans, &c. joined the Chaldees against Juda, they were punished ( C.) for their former league. v. 3. H.  
**16** *Time.* Hananias specified *two years*, (C. 28:3) which proved false. Some “silver vessels,” (Bar. 1:8) and not those of gold, it seems, ( C.) or not all, ( H.) were restored at the request of Saraias. C. 51:59.  
**18** *Host* *s.* If they prevail, account me a false prophet. C.—The things taken shall not be soon restored; but more shall be conveyed away. W.  
**19** *To thee.* Hebrew also, “concerning,” as v. 21. ( H.) though ( C.) inanimate things are often spoken to. S. Jer.  

---

## Chapter 28

**1** *Juda.* So far Sanctius joins with the former chapter, improperly. *In the 4th year*, seems rather an interpolation; though the Sept. omit *in the beginning*, &c. to reconcile the passage; and others date the 4th year from the last sabbatical one, which is quite unusual. See C. 27:1. C.—Sedecias reigned 11 years, so that the 4th might be said to be the beginning. W.—*Prophet.* Sept. “false prophet,” to explain the meaning: the original denotes any prophet. S. Jer. H.  
**3** *Years.* Some were brought back in the 4th of Sedecias; (C. 27:16. H.) so that this must be false, whether he spoke in the 1st or 4th year of his reign. C.  
**6** *Do.* Heb. also, “will do.” He speaks ironically; or shews that he wishes not the misfortune of his countrymen. C.—He approves of the good thing, but warns his people that is is falsely promised. W.  
**9** *Truth.* This criterion was given by Moses; and another was assigned in case the prophet attempted to introduce idolatry, which was not here the case. Deut. 13 and 18:20. C.  
**10** *Chain*, or wooden yoke. C. 27:2. H.  
**12** *Way*, mildly. God inspired him what to say soon after.  
**13** *Iron.* Deut. 28:48. The rashness of Hananias brought a heavier punishment on his admirers, which is the lot of all who follow heresiarchs. H.  
**17** *Seventh month.* He had spoken in the 5th of the sacred year. v. 1. C.  

---

## Chapter 29

**1** *Letter.* Lit. “book.” H.—It was probably sent at the beginning of the reign of Sedecias by his ambassadors, and is different from that sent by Baruch 1 and C. 52:28.—*Prophets.* Chal. “scribes.” C.—Sept. “false prophets.” v. 8. H.—Daniel had begun to prophesy, A. 3402. Ezechiel commenced only five years after the captivity of Jechonias. One prophet frequently instructs another, as Nathan did David. Dan. 9:2 and 1 Pet. 1:11. C.—Jeremias declares that the captivity would continue long. He comforts and rebukes to C. 40. W.  
**2** *Queen.* Nohesta.—*Eunuchs.* Real, (Heb.) or “Grandee.” Chal.—*Engravers.* C. 24:2.  
**3** *Gamarias*, the son of Saphan, is different. These two are unknown.  
**5** *Build.* Establish yourselves, as you must remain a *long* time in captivity. We are exhorted not to be attached to the things of the world, to remind us that we shall not live long. C. 16:2 and 35:7 and 1 Cor. 7:29.  
**7** *Peace.* We must submit to the magistrates, where we reside. Bar. 1:11 and 1 Tim. 2:1.  
**8** *Prophets.* There were many false ones. v. 21. Ezec. 13.—*Dreams.* The prophets, or people. They are vain.  
**10** *Seventy.* Dating from the 4th of Joakim to the 1st of Cyrus, A. 3468. C. See C. 25:1. 11. H.  
**11** *An end.* Sept. “these things.” This version is much abridged. From v. 15 to 21 is omitted in S. Jerom’s and the Rom. edit.; but not in the Comp. or Theodoret. C.—Grabe inserts what is wanting, and places the 15th at the end of our 20th verse. H.  
**15** *Said.* Expressing your confidence in Providence; or rather, if we join this with what follows, he rebukes them for trusting in false prophets, who represented their condition as worse than that of their brethren, who were left behind; whereas it was really better. v. 17 and C. 24:2. 8. C.—The deluded people suppose that the false prophets had been sent by God. W.  
**19** *By night*, or “early,” *de nocte*, as soon as the night was over. H.  
**22** *Curse.* v. 18. The malediction which has befallen the Jews, “overtake thee.” W.—*Fire*, in frying-pans, (see 2 Mac. 7:5) or cauldrons of boiling oil. This death shews that these were not the infamous judges who tempted Susanna, ( C.) as the Jews quoted by ( H.) S. Jerom, Salien, &c. would infer from v. 23 and Dan. 13:57. They were stoned to death by the people. ib. 62. C.—Yet the king might order their dead bodies to be cut in *two* and *burnt*, to express his horror of their wicked conduct. Dan. 13:55. 59. H.  
**23** *Folly.* A crime. Judge 19:23 and 2 K. 13:12.—*Witness*, the sovereign truth. C.  
**24** *And.* God orders his prophet what to say, to an accusation sent from Babylon, in consequence of the former letter. v. 5. 28. H.—Nehelamite, “torrent,” (S. Jer.) or “dreamer.” We know of no place of this name.  
**25** *The second priest*, (4 K. 25:18) a chief officer of the temple. C. 21:1.  
**26** *Joiada*, whose zeal had been conspicuous long before, under Joas, in persuading him to destroy the false prophets. 4 K. 11:17. Sophonias is exhorted to imitate him, by treating Jeremias in like manner. C.—*Thou.* Heb. “ye should be officers.” Prot. H.—There were many chief priests.—Raveth. Heb. “is possessed, and counterfeits the prophet.” Such were to be slain, being confined till sentence had been passed. Deut. 18:20. C.  
**28** *Time*, before you will return. H.—Sophonias read the letter, approving of its contents, (S. Jer.) though this is not certain. He took no violent steps against Jeremias, as Phassur had done. H.  
**32** *Sit*, in an honourable station, or they shall all die. C.  

---

## Chapter 30

**2** *Book.* This was spoken in the reign of Sedecias, for the people’s conviction. The prophet had received orders to write in the 4th year of Joakim. C. 36:1. C.  
**3** *Come.* Some in S. Jerom explain this and the following chapter of the end of the world, when all shall confess Christ. Others refer them to the preaching of the gospel alone. E. T.—But the return from captivity is specified, as prefiguring that event. S. Thomas, &c. C.—It is probable that many of the ten tribes returned to Samaria. C. 31. Ezec. 33. W.  
**4** *To Juda.* All the race of Abraham are concerned. The kingdom was no longer divided.  
**5** *We.* Jeremias is ordered to express the alarms of the captives, at the news of the destruction of Jerusalem, or rather of the Chaldee empire, by Cyrus. They were naturally afraid that they would also suffer.  
**6** *Bear.* Lit. “beget,” *generat* *.* But it has here the former signification, ( H.) *pariat* *.* Vat.—*Yellow.* The Babylonians are in great anxiety. C.  
**7** *Gr* *eat*, and terrible for this city, the outer walls of which shall be demolished, (Beros. C.) and all its glory perish. H.—*Of it.* Cyrus liberated the Jews. 1 Esd. 1.  
**8** *Strangers.* Idols. The people were not so prone to worship them. Yet the Jews were almost constantly subject to foreigners ( C.) *despectissima pars servientium, Macedonibus invalidis … sibi ipsis reges imposuere* *.* Tacit. Hist. 5.—Christ granted a more perfect liberty to the faithful. Jo. 8:33. C.  
**9** *David.* That is, Christ, of the house of David. Ch. Ezec. 37:24. Osee 3:5.—Grotius and some modern Jews, in opposition to their ancestors, (Chal. Kimchi, &c.) and to all Christians, would understand Zorobabel, though he was never possessed of the title or authority of king. C.—The prophecy may allude to him, but it is fulfilled only in Christ. Theodoret.  
**11** *Nations*, which are now no more. Grabe supplies v. 10. 11. 15 and 22. H.—*Judgment*, like a father, ( C.) though the *chastisement* may seem *cruel.* v. 14. H.—Heb. “with justice, but I will not deny thee for ever.” Chal. “utterly.” C.—Only the Church is preserved continually. All other kingdoms change. W.  
**13** *Up.* There is none to judge thy cause, or to be thy physician. C.  
**14** *Lovers.* Nations which had seduced thee to worship their idols. H.—*Enemy.* This *judgment* (v. 11) was requisite. C.  
**16** *Prey.* The Romans utterly overturned the Macedonian empire, ( H.) as the former had done the Persian, and they the Chaldee monarchy, which has risen on the ruins of the Assyrian empire. But the Jews rise as it were from their ashes. C.  
**17** *Close.* Sept. “remove the healing plaster from thy painful wound.” H.  
**18** *Temple.* After 70 years, it was rebuilt. The Church was founded on a *rock.* W.  
**19** *Play*, or laugh. C.—Prot. “make merry.” C. 31:4.—*L* *essened.* The Jews were as numerous in our Saviour’s time H. as ever they had been. C.  
**21** *Leader.* Zorobabel, the figure (Theod.) of Christ, who is here meant. C.—He springs from Jacob. W.—The sceptre was not taken away till his coming. Gen. 49. H.—*Who.* Cyrus alludes to this passage in his decree. 1 Esd. 1. C.—The prediction is fully verified in Christians. S. Jer.—Christ is near to God, being *one.* Jo. 14. W.  
**23** *Wicked*, at Jerusalem, or rather the Chaldees; and the Jews, who crucified their Messias. S. Jer. &c. C.

## Chapter 31

**1** *Israel.* The ten tribes returned as well as Juda, &c. C.—They were more ready to receive Christ than the other two tribes. Mat. 13. &c. W.  
**2** *Desert.* From which the former inhabitants had been driven, (4 K. 17:6. 24. C.) or, as those under Moses were favoured, ( H.) so shall the captives. Grot.—Sept. “I found him warm,” (θερμον, means also a *lupin*, which has misled the old Latin interpreters. S. Jer.) *murdered* “in the desert, with those slain by the sword. Go, and destroy not Israel.” H.  
**3** *Afar.* He has seemed to despise me, (S. Jer.) or he has spoken to my ancestors. C.—Chal. He has “manifested himself long ago to our fathers. Prophet, tell them I have,” &c. Ps. 35:11 and 108:11. C.  
**5** *Samaria.* Its wine was famous. Judg. 9:27. Jos. Bel. iii. 2.—*Time*, three years being elapsed. Lev. 19:35. C.—Prot. “plant, and shall eat (marg. profane) *them* as common things.” They shall not be too greedy, ( H.) but shall have leisure to enjoy the fruits of their labour. C.  
**6** *Watchmen.* Some were stationed on eminences to observe the first appearances of the moon, ( C.) which was a sort of festival. H.  
**7** *Head.* Rejoice over Babylon.—*Save.* Heb. Hoshang, “I beg,” was usually added; and this acclamation is used by the Church.  
**8** *Together.* All shall hasten, and there shall be no impediment. Is. 35:5.  
**9** *Shall*, or “came” into captivity. Bar. 6:6. Ps. 125:6. Is. 66:20.—*Way.* They shall find every accommodation, and plenty of water. Is. 35:7 and 49:10.—*Born.* Chal. “beloved.” I will treat the ten tribes as well as Juda. Christ inebriates his disciples with his graces. C.—Ephraim shall be treated with all the love and attention shewn to the first-born. W.  
**12** *Sion.* There shall be no farther schism or idolatry among them.—*No more*, if they prove faithful. This was not the case.  
**14** *Fatness.* Abundant crops secured them more plentiful tythes, as long as the *people* preserved their religion. H.—No nation had more priests, or better provided for. C.  
**15** *High.* Lit. “high places.” Heb. Rama. H.—There was a city of this name near Bethlehem, where Rachel was buried. Benjamin was her son, and was conducted by this road to Babylon. Chal. Grot. T.—Ephraim and Manasses were also her grandchildren, and she may bewail their captivity by personification. S. Mat. (2:18) shews that this prediction was more fully accomplished when the innocents were slain. The same passage may allude to different events. C.—All the people of God, both of the ten and of the two tribes, bewailed their captivity, and the mothers lamented for those slain near Bethlehem. W.  
**16** *Reward.* A time fixed for thy tears being dried up. Is. 16:14 and 40:10.  
**18** *I was.* Chal. Theodoret, and S. Chrys. have “not.” But chastisement produced a salutary effect upon the ten tribes. Osee 6:1 and 14:3.—*Convert.* Bring me back from captivity and from my evil ways. This must be attributed to grace. C.—We cannot repent without it. S. Jer.—*Da quod jubes* *.* S. Aug. Conf. x. 19. and 31. and 37.—God’s grace is the principal cause of justification. Man’s co-operation is the secondary cause. W.  
**19** *Thigh*, through grief. *Femur mœrenti plangere dextrâ* *.* Metam. xi.—Cyrus struck his thigh, mounted his horse, and went to attend the funeral of Abradates. Xen. vii.—So did Achilles for Patroclus. Il. xvi.—*Youth*, being seduced by Jeroboam.  
**20** *I spoke.* Heb. “my word is in him,” and he is docile to my instructions.  
**21** *Tower*, to bewail thy past follies; or signals to know the way, or tombs for thy beloved.  
**22** *Daughter.* Bury thy dead, and delay thy return no longer. The Israelites did not soon make use of the leave granted by Cyrus. C.—*Man.* Heb. “a hero.” T.—The fathers generally explain this of the incarnation. C.—Christ had the perfect use of reason in the virgin’s womb. H.—He was the brightness of his Father’s glory. Heb. 1:3. Even some ancient Jews apply this to the Messias. Galatin. 6:14. But the moderns understand that women would offer themselves in marriage; the times would be so happy. This was not so unusual in countries where polygamy prevailed. Ruth 3:9. Is. 4:1. Cant. 8:1. C.—Hence this is hardly the meaning; for God promises something *new.* H.—“The Lord hat created a new *thing* in a woman.” Aquila.—Symmachus agrees nearly with the Sept. “because the Lord has created thee by salvation a new plantation. Men shall go about in *thy* salvation.” This “might be explained, if it were not sacrilegious to argue respecting God’s word by human sense,” says S. Jerom; though this censure of “the Vulgate” (Sept.) seems rather harsh. He complains here of his copy. Theodoret explains it of the apostles going through the world to spread the gospel. H.—Behold whence thy happiness must come, ( M.) O thou who hast so long proved faithless, going *astray after many lovers.* H.—Christ, in his mother’s womb, was in stature small, but a perfect man ( W.) in the use of reason, &c. H.  
**23** *Bless thee.* Thus the captives speak in rapture at their return.  
**24** *Together.* Jerusalem shall be large enough to contain all, at the great festivals.  
**26** *To me.* Thus Jeremias concludes his prediction with joy. C.  
**27** *Men.* They shall increase exceedingly by my blessing. H.—*Beasts* were the source of their riches. Hence *pecunia* is derived from *pecus* *.* W.  
**29** *Edge.* Such observations had been too often made. Ezec. 18:12. H.—Henceforward you shall not suffer for the faults of Achab, Manasses, &c. Each one shall bear his own burden. The captivity has been like a deluge, cleaning all away. C.  
**31** *Covenant.* That made with the captives was not such. Their covenant is grown *old*, and at an end, as S. Paul shews. Heb. 8:8. They were not indeed divided, as they had been. Ezec. 37:16.  
**32** *Dominion* *.* As a husband, (Heb. C.) or “Lord.” H.—“I despised them.” Sept. Heb. 8.  
**33** *Heart.* They were more docile after their return: yet still their service was very imperfect and forced. How many false traditions were received, at the coming of Christ! This of course, regards his disciples.  
**34** *Lord.* Christ himself came to instruct mankind. The true God was better known than ever, even by the illiterate. Yet God requires us to have recourse to men, in order to know his truths, as S. Paul was sent to Hananias, and the eunuch to Philip. H.—The apostles were enlightened by the Holy Ghost, (Jo. 6:45. S. Aug. de Spir. C.) who still guides the flock by his pastors. The private spirit is too fanatical and delusive. H.—The most ignorant shall easily become acquainted with the truths of salvation. External preaching is requisite, though of little use unless grace touch the mind and the heart. T.—All will hear successively, ( H.) or embrace the gospel at the same time, for several years before the last day. Houbig. pref. in Prop. 356. Is. 11:9 and 45:23. Soph. 3:9. &c. H.  
**36** *Ever.* Like the Chanaanites and *Ephraim* during the captivity. Is. 7:8. God restored the latter. Yet they are again dispersed from above 17 centuries, so that this perpetuity, which shall equal the world’s duration, belongs to the Church. C.—*Israel* remains, not in the incredulous Jews, but in those who with the apostles embraced and propagated the faith of Christ. S. Jer. W.  
**37** *Out*, experimentally, and not by philosophical hypotheses, which were little known in the days of Jeremias. C.—Sept. “if *it* be made lower.” H.—This is impossible; so it is that I should abandon Israel. Theodor.—*All* was not faithless. C.—The *Israel of God* embraced the gospel. H.  
**38** *Come*, is only in the margin of the Hebrew, but is found properly in some MSS. Kennicott.—*Corner.* On the south, opposite to the former. 2 Esd. 3:1.  
**40** *Valley* of Hinnom, or Topheth, (C. 7:32 and 19:6) where Cedron flowed. Zac. 14:4. C.—The city was much enlarged on this side, under the Machabees. Jos. Bel. vi. 6.—*Ever.* Yet the temple was utterly destroyed by the Romans, so that we must explain this of the Catholic Church, founded on a *rock*, and proof against the *gates of hell*, and all the malice of heretics and persecutors. Mat. 16:18. C.

## Chapter 32

**1** *Tenth.* The city had been besieged about a year, (C. 39:1) and the prophet continued to admonish the king and people of their fate. C. 34. C.—He bought land, to shew that they should one day return. W.  
**2** *Court*, at large, so that people might come to him freely. He was not chained or in prison, as C. 37:15 and 38:6. 13. C.  
**4** *Eyes.* They were afterwards put out at Reblatha, ( H.) so that he could not see Babylon. Ezec. 12:13. W.—Sedecias was imprisoned, and buried there by the Jews. C. 34:5 and 12.  
**7** *Next.* Priests could sell only to their fellow priests. Lev. 25:34. S. Jer.—Others might dispose of their landed property to any, until the year of jubilee. The nearest relation had the first offer, but he was not obliged to purchase. Jeremias now consented, to shew that the people should return to possess the land, though it was now in the enemy’s hands. C.—Thus a Roman purchased the land on which Hannibal was encamped, despising his power and threats. V. Max. iii. 8. Livy xxvi. H.  
**8** *Came* into the city clandestinely; or rather he entered before the siege. C.  
**9** *Silver.* Heb. “seventeen sicles of silver.” H.—Coin was not yet used. C.  
**11** *O* *utside.* “There was another copy left open for inspection, (v. 14) which custom still prevails,” says S. Jerom. H.  
**14** *Days*, safe from dampness, &c. Thus Origen found a version of the Bible preserved at Jericho. C.—After the captivity, the owners shall claim their land.  
**17** *Alas.* Heb. ahah, ah! only once. Sept. “O, *thou* Being, Lord God.” H.—*Hard.* Heb. also, “hidden, wonderful,” &c. C.—“When the gods perform, nothing appears incredible.” Pindar, Pyt. x. See v. 27. Lu. 1:37. H.  
**18** *After them*, to the third and fourth generation. Ex. 34:7. His mercy is more exalted. C.  
**20** *Day.* We remember thy ancient miracles, and witness others.  
**23** *Any of.* Lit. “all those,” which seems better, as he who offends *in one*, becomes guilty *of all;* and the Jews certainly had observed some precepts, though they did not persevere unto the end. H.  
**24** *By.* Lit. “at the presence of the sword,” or by its force. Ps. 59:6. W.  
**25** *Is given*, in the eternal decrees. v. 28. H.  
**29** *B* *aal*, the sun, &c. C. 19:13. Soph. 1:5 and 4 K. 23:12. C.  
**30** *Continually*, (Sym.) “moreover,” (Aq.) or “alone.” Sept. and Theodot. v. 23. H.  
**31** *Built it.* The Jebusites polluted it. David himself offended, as well as Solomon, and under all the kings many crimes were committed, ( C.) which is always the case in large cities. These general terms only denote a great corruption, tough some would be virtuous. H.  
**34** *It*, under Achaz, Manasses, and perhaps the last kings of Juda. Ezec. 8:9.  
**35** *Consecrate.* Heb. “make *them* pass” through or into the fire, to be consumed in honour of Moloc. 4 K. 21:6.—*Heart.* They perhaps meant to imitate Abraham. C. 7:31.  
**37** *Lands.* What is here said must be understood of the captives, yet in such a manner that Christians are more particularly designated, for the Jews never enjoyed such perfect security, nor followed *one way*, nor enjoyed the eternal covenant, (v. 39. 40. C. 31:31. C.) except those who embraced the true faith of Christ. At all times *one* religion alone can be pleasing to God, (v. 39) and those who were saved under the old law, must have believed in a Redeemer to come, as we must do in one already past. H.—God would not suffer true believers to become extinct under the old law; much less will he since Christ’s coming. W.  
**41** *Truth*, like a tree which shall not be eradicated.  
**44** *Juda, and in.* A farther description of these cities is given, situated about the capital, Hebron, Sephala, (*the plain*) near Gaza, ( C.) and the Negeb or *south* country, ( H.) towards Arabia. Here the excellent commentary of S. Jerom ends, to our great loss. C.—It was perhaps his last work, undertaken after the twelve minor and the other three great prophets. He never wrote on Baruch, on the epistle of Jeremias, the Gr. parts of Daniel, &c. as the Jews did not allow them to be canonical, and the point was not then decided. The Church styles S. Jerom “the greatest doctor in expounding the sacred Scriptures,” as he translated and illustrated the greatest part of them; ( H.) and indeed he seems to have been the best qualified for the undertaking, of all the fathers. Du Pin.—Hence we may lament the more that we have not all his works in their genuine purity and perfection, as even the latest editions are very faulty, and proceed upon a plan which the learned do not approve. See A. Butler, Kennicott, &c. H.

## Chapter 33

**1** *Time.* Soon after the former. C.—He was comforted in prison by two visions, shewing that the Church should not perish for the sins of many. W.  
**2** *Thus.* Heb. uses the fem. for the neuter. Sept. “forming the earth,” &c.  
**3** *Cry.* The prophetic spirit was sometimes granted to earnest prayer. Dan. 9:2 and 10:3.  
**4** *To.* “Concerning the houses … and the sword of them,” who would not obey God, thus bringing on their own destruction.  
**6** *Their.* The houses, wounds, or *breaches.* Heb. and Sept. C.—*Peace.* That is, the peace and welfare which they pray for. Ch.—I will teach them how to pray for a durable peace.  
**8** *Iniquity*, by means of the captivity, which shall be a sort of baptism. C. 31:29. C.  
**9** *And it.* Jerusalem, as figure of the Church. M.—*Fear*, worship, and desist from persecuting God in his saints, ( H.) whom he so highly favours.  
**11** *Vows.* Promised victims of thanksgiving. C.—*First*, when they were settled in it under Josue. H.  
**13** *Mount* *ains.* C. 32:44.—*Numbereth* them, they come into the fold. C.—Chal. “my people shall be instructed, and formed by the hand of the Messias.” Grabe supplies what follows to the end of the chap. H.  
**15** *Bud*, or orient, Christ, ( C.) of whom Zorobabel was a figure. Theodoret. All cannot be verified of the latter. v. 16. C.—The Jews themselves explain this of the Messias. Calov.—It evidently refer to him, as he was born of David, whose posterity should continue till Christ, the founder of an eternal kingdom. W.  
**16** *Him.* Sept. Chal. &c. The Heb. has “her” Jerusalem, or the Church, which receives all its beauty from Christ. C.—See C. 23:5 where all read *him.* H.  
**17** *David.* This was verified in Christ, who is of the house of David; and whose kingdom in his Church shall have no end. Ch.—The tribe of Juda continued most eminent till his coming. But there was no king till Hyrcan, and he was of another tribe. The priests governed after Nehemias, till Herod was appointed by the Romans. This must therefore be explained of Christ’s eternal kingdom. Gen. 49. C.  
**18** *Priests.* This promise relates to the Christian priesthood; which shall also continue for ever: the functions of which (more especially the great sacrifice of the altar) are here expressed, by the name of holocausts, and other offerings of the law, which were so many figures of the Christian sacrifice. Ch.—The Levitical sacrifices have ceased for 17 centuries. But Christ will officiate by his ministers till the end of time. C.—S. Hypolitus and all the fathers agree that the blessed Eucharist is the complement of all the ancient sacrifices. W.  
**21** *Ministers.* The promise in not conditional, but as unchangeable as the course of the seasons. C.  
**24** *Families* of kings and priests, ( Ch.) or the two kingdoms of Israel and Juda. The people complained that God had broken his word, ( C.) so heretics assert that he has abandoned his Church for above 800 years. Providence watched in a particular manner over the families of Aaron and David, which enjoyed peculiar privileges, ( H.) or blessings. W.

## Chapter 34

**1** *Came*, in the 11th year of Sedecias, before the Chaldees returned to their siege. C. 37:4.  
**3** *Go to*, yet shall *not see Babylon*, (Ezec. 12:13) his eyes being put out. C. 32:4. C. See 4 K. 25:7. W.—Paine objects this as a false prophecy, though it was verified so terribly. Daniel, &c. would not neglect to bury the king. Watson.  
**5** *Peace.* That is, by a natural death. Ch.—*Burn* thee, like Asa; (2 Par. 16:14. C.) or aromatical spices were only burnt over their dead bodies, which were also embalmed. Sanct. Vat. &c.—Tostat says that Sedecias was intoxicated, for sport, (Hab. 2:15) and died of grief in prison. C. 52:11. C.—The king of Babylon would probably not refuse him a decent burial. Watson, Let. vi.  
**7** *Lachis*, near Hebron. Detachments were sent to different places.  
**9** *Brethren.* The sabbatical year happened in the 9th of Sedecias, when the Chaldees approaching, caused him to shew some signs of religion. But when they departed to meet the Egyptians, the people repented of what they had done well. C.—Such a relapse offends God more than the former sins, as our Saviour shews by a parable. Mat. 18. W.  
**14** *End*, or commencement. Glass. Gram. iii. 6. Ex. 21:2. Deut. 15:12. Lu. 2:21. C.  
**16** *And set.* Heb. “to their own soul,” to do as they pleased. H.  
**17** *For you.* I acknowledge you no longer as my servant. I will let loose the sword, &c. against you.  
**18** *Parts.* This was done to signify that if they transgressed, they consented to be slain. Gen. 15:9, 17. It seems Sedecias and his subjects had solemnly ratified the covenant made at Sinai, being impressed with fear of the enemy.  
**19** *Eunuchs*, chief officers. One was at the head of the army. 4 K. 25:19.  
**21** *From you*, to attack Egypt. Afterwards the various detachments came and took Jerusalem. C.  
**22** *Command.* He did not approve of their cruelty, but used them as scourges. W.

## Chapter 35

**1** *Joakim*, when Nabuchodonosor besieged him again in his 7th year. The Rechabites then pitched their tents in Jerusalem. v. 11. C.—Here we behold a figure of religious orders in the Church, as well as in the Nazarites and disciples of the prophets. Num. 6 and 4 K. 1. They observed certain rules for acquiring greater perfection, and refrained from many things which were otherwise lawful. Thus various religious orders, both of men and of women, have flourished in the Church, and though they have different names and regulations, yet they are not sects, as heretics would pretend, but all follow the same faith, use the same sacraments, and are a great ornament to the Catholic Church by their profession of the three essential vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, in imitation of the apostles. Mat. 19:12.—*Joakim.* This happened before the preceding prophecies. W.  
**2** *Rechabites.* These were of the race of Jethro, father-in-law to Moses. Ch.—All the Heb. and Latin doctors agree that the Rechabites were *strangers.* v. 7. 19. W.—*Treasures* of corn, wine, &c. Jeremias, as a priest, had free access.  
**4** *Of God.* Prophets are generally thus designated. 4 K. 4:7. We know nothing more of this holy man.—*Princes* of the priests; or where princes made their offerings, or assembled to judge. C. 26:10.—*Entry.* He was not removeable like the other Levites. 1 Par. 9:19. 34. C.  
**5** *Wine.* This was not an exhortation, but a trial. H.  
**6** *Jonadab.* A man much esteemed by Jehu. 4 K. 10:15. W.  
**7** *Days.* The reward of dutiful children. Ex. 20:12. These are models of those Christians who follow the rule of some virtuous person, in order to be at a greater distance from any transgression of the law, and to observe it with more perfection. C.—“If a father could lay such an injunction on his descendants, and they receive commendation for observing it, why may not the fathers of the Church enjoin things which are not of themselves necessary, but … useful to avoid the occasions of evil, or to advance in virtue?” says Grotius, a Protestant, after S. Jerom, (ad Paulin.) S. Aug. in Ps. lxx. &c. H. Jonadab exhorted, and prescribed this rule, but it was not properly a command, being too arduous. T.  
**11** *Syria.* 4 K. 24:2. The mention of these shews that this was the second siege, when Joakim was slain, and many led into captivity, (C. 52:28) with these Rechabites. C.—They lived under tents, but in case of necessity entered the city. v. 10. If they observe works of supererogation, all must surely keep God’s law. W.  
**14** *Me.* What a contrast! H.—This was only a counsel, mine a law! T.  
**19** *Before me*, in an honourable situation (1 Par. 2:55) about the temple. It was not requisite that they should be Levites. C.—*For ever.* Their reward shall be eternal bliss. H.—This they sought for, as they were *strangers* of Madian in the country. v. 7. M.

## Chapter 36

**1** *Fourth*, towards the conclusion, after the siege was raised. v. 6. 9.  
**2** *Write.* He had already prophesied 22 years. Now he was more frequently ordered to write. C.—He executed the order by the hand of Baruch. 5:4.  
**3** *If.* This indicates free-will. H.—God makes this last effort, that the hearing of so many separate prophecies together might make a deeper impression.  
**4** *Book.* This was afterwards burnt. What he wrote a second time has not come down to us, in the same order. Jeremias made us of his memory, which was directed by the Holy Spirit. C.  
**5** *Shut up.* Not that the prophet was now in prison; for the contrary appears from v. 19 but that he kept himself shut up, by reason of the persecutions he had lately met with. See C. 26. Ch.—If he had been confined, as Grotius asserts, the king would easily have found him. C.—He and Baruch retired to some secret place, as most priests ( W.) did formerly in England, ( H.) that they might better exercise their functions than they could do in the hands of the persecutors. W.  
**6** *Read.* This may sometimes have as good an effect as preaching without a book. H.—*Fasting day* of expiation, (Usher, A. 3398) or rather on ( H.) the day prescribed in the 9th *month.* v. 9. Lyran. T.  
**7** *They.* Lit. “their supplication may fall prostrate before,” &c. H.—It is personified. So Homer represents ( C.) “supplications,” as daughters of Jupiter, lame, and with eyes averted, (Il. ix.) to shew how we ought to pray. Jeremias finds means to instruct the people: the *word of God is not bound.* 2 Tim. 2:9. C.—As many refused to hear his discourses, God ordered him to write what might be a perpetual warning and reproach, or testimony against them. W.  
**9** *Fast.* Probably on account of the catastrophe the second year. Dan. 1:2. Many such were afterwards appointed. Zac. 7:3 and 8:19. All came to Jerusalem on such occasions.  
**10** *Gate*, on the east, (2 Par. 20:5) leading to the court of the priests. C.  
**18** *Readi* *ng.* No study was requisite. H.—*Ink.* It formerly resembled that used by printers, ( C.) being composed of soot and gum. Vitruv. 7:10.  
**19** *Are.* Thus they provide for the safety of the prophets, and perform their duty to the king.  
**21** *Read it.* This was the third time. It was in vain afterwards to destroy the book.  
**22** *Winter-house.* He was very magnificent, and had other apartments for summer. Though the climate was warm, fires would be useful in November.—*Hearth.* There was no chimney used, and the smoke went out by the door, or by holes at the top of the room, as we see in some old monasteries. C.—Charcoal was probably used. Bar. 6:42.  
**23** *Pages.* Perhaps what was written on so many skins, ( H.) or sheets of paper, pasted together, and rolled up; or there might be some marks to shew the different subjects, like the sections used in the synagogue, ( C.) or our chapters; though we are assured that all was formerly written without any separation even of letters. Prot. have “leaves.” H.—Heb. “doors.” C. The secretary cut and burnt the leaves by the king’s order. v. 25. W.  
**24** *Afraid.* They saw all without any concern, not believing that God spoke to them. They did not imitate Josias. 2 Par. 34:19.  
**26** *Hid them*, and prevented any one from betraying them. C.—He did not remove them to a place different from what they had chosen by his direction. W.  
**30** *None*, &c. Because his son, Joachin or Jechonias, within three months after the death of his father, was carried away to Babylon, so that his reign is not worthy to be taken notice of. Ch. Theodoret. W.—He was subject to the Chaldees; his uncle took his place. Joakim had the burial of an ass. C. 22:18. C.—None of the following princes enjoyed the glory or power of the ancient king. S. Tho. p. 3. qu. 31. a. 2. W.  
**32** *Before.* We cannot tell what. C.—Prot. “many like words.” H.

## Chapter 37

**1** *Sedecias* *.* He was less impious than his two predecessors; but too weak to do good.  
**3** *Pray*, or consult. He wished to know whether the Chaldees would return. C.—He feared, yet ill-treated the prophet, as Herod did the baptist. W.  
**6** *Return*, routed. C. 46:15. His army was small. Ezec. 17:17 and 30:21. This king Ephree, (C. 44:30) or Apries, had succeeded Psammis, after an interregnum of ten years’ continuance. Herod. ii. 161.—He foresaw that his own dominions would be invaded, after Jerusalem, the key, was taken. The other allies of Juda perfidiously sat still, or joined the Chaldees. C.  
**8** *Away.* They departed indeed, but for a short time.  
**9** *Tent.* So easy it is for God to destroy by few as well as by many! H.  
**11** *Possession*, lately purchased. C. 32. Lyran.—Yet some think this had not yet taken place. C.—Sept. “to buy *provisions* among.” Heb. “to slip away thence in the midst of the people.” H.—He wished to escape the fury of his enemies at Jerusalem. C.—It is an old device of persecutors to lay false charges on the innocent, as Julian and the Arians did. Hist. Tripart. vi. 27. W.  
**14** *Beat him*, as a traitor and fugitive.—*Prison*, very deep. v. 19. C.  
**15** *Prison.* Lit. “lake or pit,” ( H.) such as was used to keep wine. Thus God tries his chosen friends, according to their strength!  
**18** *Prophets.* He insults over these impostors, and speaks boldly. The Chaldees were now returned. C. 38.  
**19** *Be.* Heb. “fall prostrate.” C. 36:7.  
**20** *Entry*, where he had been already. C. 32:1 and 34:1. 7.—*Piece.* Roll, sufficient for a day’s maintenance. C.—Prot. “a piece of bread (Sept. a loaf) out of the baker’s street.” H.  

---

## Chapter 38

**1** *And Phassur*, the violent priest. C. 20:1.—*People*, who might come to the entry of the prison.  
**2** *Safe.* Heb. “a booty.” C. 21:9.—Sept. “like a thing found.” C.—The Hebrew idiom implies that he shall most surely live. Voluntary offerings prevent eternal misery. W.  
**5** *Lawful.* This is a compliment, or Sedecias complains indirectly that they had only left him the name of king. He grieved at the treatment of the prophet. C.  
**6** *Mire*, up to the neck; so that he would soon have been smothered. Jos. Ant. x. 10.  
**7** *Eunuch.* Officer over 30. v. 10. H.—He was afterwards rewarded. C. 39:15. C.—God moves some to pity the distressed, till he recompense their patience. W.  
**9** *City.* It was useless, therefore, to add the torment of the dungeon, since he must soon have perished. C.  
**12** *Arms.* He was probably naked. Sanctius.  
**14** *Third*, or officers of the guard’s *gate*, leading from the palace to the temple. 4 K. 11:19. C.—Heb. hashelishi; ( H.) the third denotes also an officer of the army.  
**17** *King.* He was at Reblatha. Though an usurper, he had claims upon Sedecias, whom he had appointed ruler, on his swearing to be faithful and to pay tribute. The prophet’s advice was just. C.—Even conditional prophecies are certain, and the king would have been treated differently if he had complied. But on his refusal, great misery ensued. W.  
**19** *Jews.* Traitors, whom Sedecias had perhaps treated ill. C.  
**22** *Say.* At parting, bewailing thy blindness, which has entailed misery upon all. H.—*Of peace.* That is, thy false friends, promising thee peace and happiness, and by their evil counsels involving thee in misery. Ch.—*Mire* *.* He alludes to his own treatment, ( C.) which he had received from these false counsellors or *princes.* v. 4. H.  
**26** *T* *here.* This he had actually done. C. 37:19. He perhaps renewed the petition, at this interview, to satisfy the king. H.—We may conceal the truth, but must never speak what is false. C.—“In a matter, says Puffendorf, which I am not *obliged* to declare to another, if I cannot with safety conceal the whole, I may fairly discover no more than a part.” Who can require a privy counsellor to reveal the king’s secret? Yet Paine accuses the prophet of duplicity! Watson.

## Chapter 39

**2** *Fifth.* The parallel passages and other editions read *ninth.* Some pretend that ( C.) the city was taken on the 5th of the 4th month, and after being pillaged was burnt on the 7th (4 K. 24:8) or 10th of the 5th month. C. 52:12. Sanct. A. Lap.—But the city was taken on the 9th of the 4th month, and Nabuzardan entered on the 7th of the 5th month, and burnt it and the temple on the 10th. Salien, &c. C.—From the beginning of the siege ( A. 3414) to the end ( A. 3416. Usher), two years and a half elapsed. It was interrupted a short time. Two fasts are still observed by the Jews to deplore these events. Zac. 7:3 and 8:19.  
**3** *Neregel, Sereser* *.* Perhaps Nabuzardan should be read, (v. 13. H.) or these names are mentioned twice, probably by mistake of transcribers. The former was an idol; (4 K. 17:30) the latter word means “treasurer.” C.—Prot. Nergal—Sharezer seems to be one person, as in Sept. or “treasurer of Nergel.” H.—*Samgar-nebu*, was “prefect of *the temple* of Nabo.”—*Sar* *sachim*, “prince of the sacæ, or Scythians.”—*Rabsares*, “master of the eunuchs,” or officers within the palace. Such a one was employed by Sennacherib. 4 K. 18:17.—*Rebmag*, “chief of the magi,” ( C.) or “master of the camp.” Jun.—These entered the first wall. C. 1:15. Is. 22:7.  
**4** *Walls.* This gate had not yet been seized, ( C.) leading to Jericho. v. 5. H. Ezec. 12:4.—Sept. Rom. passes over the next 12 verses, which seem to be taken from 4 K. 25:4. C.—Grabe supplies v. 4 to 13 inclusively. “And they sent,” &c. which is well connected with v. 3.—The possession of one gate would let all the army enter: whereupon Sedecias fled by a postern gate. W.  
**5** *In the land*, or environs of Emesa, in Syria. Theod.—*Judgment.* Reproaching him with perfidy and ingratitude. W.—He slew the nobles, as his accomplices.  
**9** *Army.* Heb. “slayers,” denoting soldiers, cooks, and sacrificers. Gen. 37:36.—*Remained*, having escaped the sword, &c. They had been spared when Joakim and Jechonias were taken.  
**10** **Ver** **.** **10** **.** *Cisterns*, and fields. 4 K. 25:12. They were thus attached to the Chaldees.  
**11** *Had given*, after the prisoners had got to Rama. C. 40:1.  
**13** *Nabusezban* perhaps stand for Semegar, Nabu, and Sarsachim. The other four officers occur v. 3. C.  
**14** *Godolias* *.* The Jews say he had gone over to assist the Chaldees. T.  
**18** *Saved.* Heb. “a booty.” C. 21:9. Thus God rewards what is done to his servants. Mat. 25:40. C.

## Chapter 40

**1** *Word.* This happened to Jeremias; (Raban) or the prophet rather interrupts what he was about to say, to let the reader know the state of affairs, when he was consulted about the journey into Egypt. C. 42:9.—*Rama;* probably in Benjamin, near Bethel. Judg. 19:12. C.—In this last part, Jeremias foretells what would befall the Jews in Egypt, and other nations. W.  
**3** *You*, people of Juda. H.—This pagan acknowledges that God had punished his people, (C. 18:16. C.) as Titus did at the last siege. Josephus. H.—He acknowledges the justice of God. W.  
**4** *Eyes*, with all kindness. C. 39:12. H.—*Before thee.* Thou hast liberty to choose. Gen. 13:9 and 20:15 and 24:51.  
**5** *And.* Heb. “And as he (the people, or Godolias) will not return, dwell;” or, “He had not yet answered, *wh* *en the general said:* Return to Godolias.” He perceived that the prophet was not desirous of going to Babylon; and he insinuated that such a step would not be for his advantage, as the captives would not return.—*Presents.* He had been plundered like the rest.  
**6** *Masphath;* because it was near Jerusalem, and an ancient place of devotion. C.  
**7** *Captains*, who had fled from Sedecias, and effected their escape. Jos. Ant. x. 11.  
**9** *With you.* They might naturally suspect Godolias, and think that the Chaldees would seize them as soon as they should know of their escape.  
**10** *Answer.* Heb. “stand before,” as minister ( H.) for the Chaldees. You need not be jealous of my power; and I can answer that they will not hurt you, provided you continue quiet. C.—He promises to act in behalf of the people, as a governor ought to do. W.

**13** *Came*, having discovered the design of Ismahel, whose ambition prompted him to murder the governor, that he might reign: as he was of the royal family. C. 41:1. C.  
**14** *Baalis* *.* Queen. Grot.—The Ammonites sought the entire ruin of the Jews.  
**16** *Do not* *.* He did right in forbidding this assassination, which could never be authorized, even to prevent a similar crime. Godolias should have taken precautions: but he was too open, ( C.) like Eumenes. Grot.

## Chapter 41

**1** *Month;* Tisri, the third of which is still observed as a fast by the Jews. C.—Godolias had given a supper to the traitors, and had drunk plentifully. They set upon him while he and the people were retired to rest. Jos. Ant. x. 11.—This happened two months after the burning of Jerusalem. C. 29:2. Nabuchodonosor soon after punished this perfidy of the Ammonites. C.—*Bread:* feasted. H.—Such tragedies are usually performed with the show of friendship. W.  
**4** *Second*, or next day. All had been slain in the night but some captives. C.  
**5** *Rent*, as people *mourning.* Lit. “dirty.” Heb. and Sept. “cut.” H. C. 16:6. Lev. 19:28.—*Lord*, Masphath, were people performed their devotions, as well as they could. Judg. 20:1 and 1 Mac. 3:46. Jeremias had probably ordered an altar to be erected, as Samuel had done. 1 K. 7:6. C.—Others think that these people went thither for a priest, to offer what they had brought on the altar of Jerusalem. Bar. 1:10. T.—Masphath lay to the south. C.—It seems many of the people about Samaria were true believers, and even more affected at the destruction of the temple. H.—Their city had been demolished by Salmanasar ( C.) long before, and many fresh inhabitants introduced, who adhered to idols. H.  
**6** *He*. Sept. “they.” Yet Heb. intimates that Ismahel feigned tears. C.—He did not weep sincerely. W.  
**7** *Into.* Lit. “slew them about the,” &c. H.—The pit was not full of water, but had been intended by Asa for a reservoir, (v. 9 and 3 K. 15:20. C.) when he built Maspha. W.

**10** *King’s;* Sedecias, ( C.) or some of his predecessors, as all the women were taken, (C. 38:22, 23) unless those had escaped before. H.  
**11** *Johanan.* He and the rest of the fugitives thus shewed that they were clean. W.  
**12** *Gabaon*, famous for the battle of Abner. 2 K. 2:13.

**16** *Eunuchs;* officers of Sedecias, who had escaped. C. 40:9.  
**17** *As.* Heb. “at the station *or* inn of Chamaam,” the son of Berzellai. Chal. Perhaps our Saviour was born in this ( C.) “inn,” (Eus. Dem. vii. 4.) which was then deserted. H.—*Egypt.* These poor wretches find no repose. C.

## Chapter 42

**2** *Pray;* consult. v. 4. C. 37:3. H.—*Few;* comparatively, though there was a great number. C. 43:5.

**6** *Good or evil.* That is, agreeable or disagreeable. Ch.—It would have been well for them if they had been sincere, (v. 10. H.) and determined to comply whether the prophet announced prosperity or the reverse. W.  
**7** *Days.* The *Spirit breathes where he will*, and the prophets must wait his good time. Jeremias prayed for ten days in that place. He now resumes his discourse. C. 40:1.  
**10** *Appeased.* Heb. “comforted.” Sept. “at rest.” I forget ( C.) or pardon ( H.) the past.  
**12** *And will.* Heb. “and he will.” The king will take pity on you.—*Dwell.* Sept. “return;” which is less correct.

## Chapter 43

**2** *Proud* and headstrong. C.—Sinful people easily become worse. They are guilty of calumny, and comply not with their promise/ C. 42:5. W.  
**3** *Baruch.* He had been at Babylon, and was liberated with Jeremias, always speaking with moderation of the king of Babylon, and exhorting the people to submission. This was enough to make the populace suspect. They are incapable of reasoning.  
**6** *And Baruch*, by compulsion. W. C.—Hence God did not cease to speak by their mouth. H.  
**8** *Taphnis*, or *Daphnæ Pelusiæ*, sixteen miles from Pelusium, (Antonin.) the Hanes of Isaias, (30:4) and key of Egypt. It was a royal city.

**1** *Magdal*, the third station of the Israelites, (Ex. 14:2) or another “tower” twelve miles from Pelusium. C. 46:14.—*Memphis*, the capital of Nome, near the western banks of the Nile, and famous for its pyramids, which are standing, though the town be no more. C. 46:19.—*Phatures* *;* perhaps in higher Egypt. Jeremias might go or send to these cities, this his last prediction, ( C.) to reclaim his countrymen from idolatry. H.  
**2** *Inhabitant:* or the number is exceedingly small. C.—All the Jews had retired. H.—It would be well if people would reflect, how those who have given way to heresy and infidelity have been treated. W.  
**6** *Forth*, drop by drop. C. 42:18. I have repeatedly warned them by punishments. H.  
**8** *Gods.* Their blindness and malice was inconceivable. They attribute their past miseries to the neglect of worshipping the moon! v. 18. They may be compared to a mixture of iron and brass, which is put through the crucible in vain. C. 6:29. Ezec. 22:18.  
**11** *Face*, to punish grievously. Ezec. 4:3 and 20:35. C.—All did not perish, but the far greatest part. v. 14. 28. W.  
**14** *Desire* and expectation. C. 22:27. They meant to return as soon as the Chaldees had left the country: but their hose were vain. The enemy would fall upon Egypt, after he had taken Tyre and the neighbouring provinces; and those who had not abandoned that country in time, would perish. v. 12. 26. C.  
**17** *The queen of heaven;* the moon, which they worshipped under this name, ( Ch.) as also under that of the Celestial Venus, (Theod.) Diana, and Isis. It seems the Jews had engaged by vow (v. 27) to restore her worship. C.—The women more particularly adored the moon: yet all were guilty. C. 7:18 and 4 K. 23:5. W.  
**18** *Famine.* They think nothing of the transgression of the law, &c. v. 23. Could obduracy and blindness go greater lengths? 1 Mac. 1:12.  
**19** *Worship.* Heb. “to represent.” The cakes had a crescent on them. C. See Hesychius in σεληναι.—*Husbands.* The women are most zealous. But all partook of this idolatry. C. 7:18. C.  
**21** *Heart*, or mind to punish you for idolatry. Sacrifices could be offered to the Lord only in his temple. H.  
**26** *Liveth.* They swore by his name as by that of idols. God could not abide such company. C.—Not one of these obstinate Jews shall be spared. v. 14. Others, like Jeremias, the Sept. and the holy family, no doubt called upon the Lord in the land of Egypt. H.  
**30** *Enemies.* Herodotus (ii. 161. 169.) informs us that Apries reigned fortunately twenty-five years, when he lost many of his men fighting against the Cyreneans, and was dethroned by Amasis, and strangled by his subjects. Usher ( A. 3433) suspects that Amasis was assisted and confirmed by Nabuchodonosor, and he might this fulfill the prophecies. C. 43:11. &c. Ezec. 29. &c. Josephus (Ant. x. 11.) and Berosus (c. Ap. i.) assert, that Nabuchodonosor defeated and slew the king of Egypt, though Herodotus is silent on this subject, his account being communicated by the Egyptian priests, and full of fables. C.

## Chapter 45

**1** *Book*, which Joakim burnt, and sought the life of the prophets. C. 36. C.—Baruch apprised of the general distress, weeps for it, and his life is spared. W.

## Chapter 46

**1** *Gentiles*, to whom Jeremias was sent. C. 1:5. What follows regards them, ( C.) if we except the last chapter. H.—It was thought proper to place these predictions here, though out of their chronological order, to which the Sept. have more adhered, placing them after C. 25. C.—The punishment of the chief enemies of the Jews is foretold. W.  
**2** *Nechao* *.* He slew Josias, and took all as far as Charcamis. 4 K. 23. Four years after Nabopolasser associated his son, and sent him to conquer these countries, which he effected. 4 K. 24:7. Jos.  
**3** *Prepare* Egyptians, the enemy is at hand. C.  
**5** *Seen.* The prophets usually speak as if things were already past. W.  
**6** *Away.* It will be in vain. C.—Nechao went to defend Charcamis, but lost “many myriads in the battle,” and all the country “as far as Pelusium, except Judea.” Joseph. x. 7.

**10** *Devour.* It seems animated, and eager to slay the victim. Ezec. 39:17.  
**11** *Of Egyp* *t;* or ye Egyptians, who have been wounded. The balm ( H.) or *resina* of Galaad was then very famous. Gen. 37:25. C.—Egypt thought itself invulnerable, and is derided. Its cures was hopeless. v. 16. W.  
**13** **V** **er.** **13** **.** *Egypt*, under Apries, about thirty-five years after the former expedition. C. 44:30. Ezec. 29 and 31. This country was invaded the last. v. 14.

**16** *Dove.* Heb. also, “of the destroyer.” Sept. “Greeks,” or Ionians. C.—See C. 25:35. Ch.—Nebuchodonosor came with expedition, or had a dove on his standards. M.

Prot. “*is but* a noise, he hath passed the time appointed;” ( H.) or, “the height which the crowd (or God, *who raised*) hath displaced.” C.—Sept. retain the original: but the middle word varies in their copies. H.—All the boasts of Pharao ended in smoke. He lost the proper opportunity, and caused his own kingdom to be laid waste. Syr. “the disturber, who deranges the times.” C.

Sept.) in the Delta, north of Busiris. Ammon was the chief god adored at No. Nah. 3:8. Sept. Alex. “I will revenge myself on Ammon, her son, on Egypt, or Pharao, and on them.” H.—Ammon was of their invention, and for this the people were justly punished. It means also, “a multitude.”—*Kings.* C. 42:12. Apries was slain, (C. 44:23. C.) and his two successors perished miserably by sentence of Cambyses. Herod. iii. 14. and 16.

## Chapter 47

**1** *Gaza*, going or returning from Charcamis. Apries also attacked Tyre, and would of course invade the Philistines.

## Chapter 48

**1** *Moab.* This people broke their covenant with Sedecias, yet were punished for having entered into it, five years after the taking of Jerusalem. Jos. S. Jer. in C. xxv. 32.—The same war is described by Ezec. 25:8. Soph. 2:8. Many words of Isaias (15 and 16 and 24) are adopted, though he speaks of what happened under Ezechias.—*Nabo*, a town at the foot of that mountain, where Moses died. Deut. 34. It might have been famous for some pretended “oracle.” Is. 15:2 and 46:1. This chief city, with the rest, shall be destroyed.

**28** *Place.* Seek for shelter in the caverns and highest mountains. H.

## Chapter 49

**1** *Melchom*, the idol of the Ammonites. Ch.—Gad, to whom a part of their country was assigned. After the captivity this tribe, the Ammonites seized the country, regardless of God’s appointment.

C.—They had taken the country as their right, as if all Israel had perished; which God resents. W.  
**2** *Rabbath;* called Amana, Astarte, and Philadelphia, by Stephanus.—*Possess;* returning first from captivity, and subduing the cities of Ammon, under Hyrcan. 1 Mac. 5:6.  
**3** *Hai*, or Je-abarim. Both these cities pertained also to Moab.—*Hedges.* Heb. Gederoth, may be the city Gadara.—*Melchom*, or Moloc, who claimed dominion over this people.

**7** Edom*.* This nation was involved in the common ruin, for its barbarity towards God’s people. Abd. x. Ps. 136:7. Ezec. 25:12.—*Theman*, renowned formerly for wisdom. Job 2:11. Yet at the approach of danger, all were confounded. C.—They were only worldly wise. W.

**14** *Ambassador;* Jeremias: or rather this is a personification of the passions, which would sufficiently prompt the Chaldees. C.—A good angel might urge them to execute the divine decrees. Theodoret.—The greatest armies are thus made use of by Providence, without approving of their malicious designs.  
**15** *Little.* Edom was scarcely known, except in sacred history; and it was forced to receive circumcision by the Machabees.  
**16** **Ve** **r.** **16** **.** *Hill.* The mountains were numerous, and full of caverns. v. 8.  
**17** *Desolate.* The few who survived left their ancient territories, which are now a desert, like most of Stony Arabia. C.—*Hiss*, out of contempt. The punishment was so great as to excite surprise. W.  
**19** *Swelling.* Lit. “pride;” ( H.) or those banks which the Jordan reaches, when it overflows. They are lined with woods, from which lions rush to devour the sheep. C.—*Strong* “one’s dwelling.” Heb. H. Zac. 11:3.—*Over her.* What sort of men come to the attack? or, who shall dare resist them? C.  
**20** *Little.* Chal. “chiefs of the people.” Tsair ( H.) is supposed to have this sense. Mic. 5:2. C.—But the weakest of the Chaldees will be an overmatch for Edom. H.  
**23** *Damascus*, the capital of Syria. Is. 7:8. W.—It was punished at the same time as the rest. Jos.—*Arphad* *;* Arad, an island near Tyre, or *Raphanæ* *.* Theod.—Syr. “Rephad … they are troubled from the sea.” Nabuchodonosor left Tyre to invade them. C.—*As in.* The islands of the Mediterranean tremble for themselves, and all Syria is afraid, hearing of the fall of so many cities and nations.  
**25** *They.* Heb. Sept. and Chal. add, “not.” Why have they not spared this beautiful city? or, why have not its citizens given it up, to prevent its entire demolition?  
**27** *Benadad* *.* So the kings were usually styled. 3 K. 15:8. Sept. “the son of Ader.”  
**28** *Ceda* *r* and *Asor* were parts of Arabia; which, with Moab, Ammon, Edom, &c. were all brought under the yoke of Nabuchodonosor. Ch.—We know nothing of the situation of Asor, which means “a court.” C.—It might be the flying camp (Theod.) of the Saracens, (S. Jer. in Is. xxi. 16) who dwelt under tents like the hordes of Tartars, the Ethiopian emperor, and the mogul. Yet this seems to have been a fixed habitation. v. 30. 33.—*East;* the Desert Arabia. v. 32. C.—*Cedar* was the son of Ismael, and Asor the chief city of the Agarens. W.  
**29** *About.* The enemy shall terrify them, and plunder all their riches.  
**31** *Alone.* We need not fear any resistance. They have no allies. C.—The ancient Suevi, of Germany, laid waste the surrounding countries, that they might appear more terrible. Cesar iv. and vi.  
**32** **Ve** **r.** **32** **.** *Wind;* throughout the world.—*Round.* C. 9:26. C.—This the Arabs did, in imitation of Bacchus. Herod. iii. 8.  
**34** *Elam.* A part of Persia. Ch.—The Elamites had besieged Jerusalem, under Manasses, ( C.) and are therefore punished. W.—They were subject to Aseradon: Nabuchodonosor subdued them after the other nations. v. 36. Cyrus set his countrymen at liberty, ( C.) and thus began his conquests. H.—Pagan historians assert, at random, that they were before subject to the Medes.  
**38** *Thence.* Daniel (8:2) governed at Susa, the capital of Elam, for Baltassar.  
**39** *Return.* They joined the standards of Cyrus, and became masters of the East. C.—This and similar texts are understood of the conversion of the Gentiles. Acts 2:7. W.

## Chapter 50

**1** *Prophet.* He had spoken against them in the fourth year of Joachim, and now is more explicit in the fourth of Sedecias, (C. 51:60) sending his predictions to be read, and then thrown into the Euphrates. The fall of Babylon was gradual. It was in consequence of her pride and cruelty, v. 11, 17, 23, 29. Is. 47:6. C.—It had shewn the greatest enmity to the Jews, and was at last overthrown by the Medes and Persians. W.  
**2** *Declare.* This is grand. Let all the captives publish these tidings. C.—*Bel*, &c. Bel and Merodach were worshipped for gods by the men of Babylon. Ch.—Merodach might be an ancient king deified. C.—These greatest of their idols could neither save the people nor themselves. W.  
**3** *A nation*, &c. viz. the Medes, ( Ch.) under Darius, (Dan. 5:31. Theod. Grot.) or rather under Cyrus, who came upon Babylon from the north, after conquering Asia; though he was born to the east of that city. Is. 61:2 7. He was a Mede by his mother, and ruler of that nation. He gave liberty to the Jews, as the prophet inculcates ten times.—*Desolate.* Herodotus. Xenophon, &c. say not that Cyrus demolished any part of the city; but Berosus informs us that he took it without opposition, and levelled the outer walls. Hystaspes did more damage. Herod. iii. 150.  
**4** *Weeping* for joy and compunction. Israel returns, as well as Juda. C.—Thus Joseph wept when he beheld his brethren. Gen. 42:24. W.  
**5** *Covenant.* They renewed the old one under Nehemias, and never publicly broke it, as they had done. Yet the covenant of Christ is more properly meant.  
**6** *Shepherds;* kings, ( C.) and false prophets. H.  
**7** *Not sinned:* the Jews were such notorious offenders. But in what had they injured the Chaldees?—*Beauty.* Heb. “dwelling or fold.”  
**8** *Kids;* rams. This comparison was not ignoble. Go boldly out of the city, before it be besieged.  
**9** *Nations.* Cyrus had Armenians, &c. in his army. C.—*Thence*, by the bed of the Euphrates, the waters of which were mostly let out into the marshes. Thus the city was taken, while the people were feasting. Herod. i. 191.—Aristotle (Pol. iii. 3.) says, three days passed before all the citizens were apprised of its fate, it was so extensive: but this is incredible. If we follow the account of Berosus, Cyrus routed Nabonides, who fled to Borsippe, while he took Babylon and demolished the outer walls. Jos. c. Ap. i. C.—*N* *orth*, with respect to Babylon. W.—The Persians lay rather to the south, and to the east of Palestine, ( H.) if our maps be accurate. C.  
**11** *Bulls.* You have rioted in Juda, and treated my people cruelly. H.—In Hebrew four verbs have improperly *i* for *v;* but C. 51:34. *v* supplants *i* five times. Kennicott.  
**12** *Dust*, like a suppliant. Is. 47:1. C.—*Dry.* The country shall be equally unfruitful. The waters of the Euphrates being let off, gave a passage to the enemy. v. 9. H.—Babylon soon lost its splendour. C.—Vologeses completed its ruin. Pliny vi. 26.—It ceased to be the metropolis or *mother* city. H.—The whole country was laid waste. W.  
**15** *Hand*, to form leagues; or she faints, (Sept.) and submits. Lam. 5:6.  
**16** *Harvest.* Such were usually unmolested. C.—Babylon was so large, that people sowed corn within the walls. Curt. v.—The environs were well cultivated. Pliny xviii. 17.—*Dove*, or the *destroyer;* for the Hebrew word signifies either the one or the other. Ch. C. 25:38 and 46:16.—Lit. “from before the sword of the dove.” The power of Babylon is no more. H.—The king is compared to a dove, for his swiftness; or God is meek, though terrible. W.—*Land.* The other nations were set free as well as the Jews. C.  
**17** *Bones.* He completely ruined the nation, which the Assyrians had left. H.—They led the ten tribes away, and the Chaldees took the rest. 4 K. 18 and 25. W.  
**18** **Ver** **.** **18** **.** *Assyria.* This monarchy was subdued by Nabopolasser.  
**19** *Israel;* the ten tribes, whose country is specified.  
**20** *None.* Idolatry shall not be re-established.  
**21** *Rulers:* the most potent empire of Babylon.—*All.* Heb. “anathematize them and their posterity.”  
**23** *Hammer.* The violent injustice of the Chaldees is thus entitled.  
**24** *Aware.* Men seemed to rise out of the earth. v. 9.  
**25** *Armoury.* Fire and war are the Lord’s weapons. Job 38:22.—*Work:* punishment. C. 48:10.  
**26** *That.* Heb. “her granaries; trample on her as on heaps of corn, destroy,” &c. He alludes to the custom of oxen trampling out the corn. C. 51:33.  
**28** *Voice.* I hear the captives proclaiming this at their return.  
**30** *Peace*, in the grave; ( C.) or shall submit quietly. 1 Mac. 1:3. H.  
**31** **V** **er.** **31** **.** *Proud.* So the Chaldees are often styled in the Psalms. 100.—The prophet addresses Nabuchodonosor, or rather Baltassar, ( M.) under whom the city was taken, (Jos. &c.) by Darius and Cyrus. He may be the Nabonides of Berosus, the question is so much perplexed. Yet “we are convinced that Darius reigned at Babylon before Cyrus, and took the city after the death of Baltassar.” C.—Most commentators are of a difficult opinion. H.  
**33** *Israel.* Samaria had been destroyed forty-four years before the fourth of Joakim, from which period many of Juda had been captives seventy years, till Cyrus became their deliverer, and chastised the Chaldees. C.—Both kingdoms had been oppressed by a strong hand, till a stronger, even God himself, delivered them. W.  
**34** *Name.* He gives victory to Cyrus. Thus the Lord directs all for the sake of his elect, and laughs at the vain projects of men. C.  
**35** *Wise men.* They were styled Chaldees, and inhabited a certain part of the city, being employed in astronomical and mathematical observations. They disapproved of those who cast nativities. Strabo xvi.  
**36** *Diviners.* Heb. “impostors.” They were nowhere more plentiful. Dan. 1:20. Fortune-tellers were consulted on every occasion. The eastern nations are still much addicted to this superstition.  
**38** *Drought.* Cyrus almost drained the Euphrates. C. 51:42. Is. 21.—*Things*, fit to terrify children. Bar. 6:14. C.—Prot. “they are made upon their idols.” H.  
**39** *Fig-fauns.* Monsters of the desert, or demons in monstrous shapes; such as the ancients called *fauns* and *satyrs:* and as they imagined them to live upon wild figs, they called them *fauni-ficarii*, or *fig-fauns.* Ch.—Maldonat reads *sicariis*, “ruffians.” Sixtus V. and S. Jerom, (in Is. 13:21) have *fatuis*, “foolish wild men.” Heb. “the Tsiim iwth the iim shall dwell there, and the daughters of the *Yahana* ( H. swans) shall there reside,” or “*fishermen* among the *rushes* shall dwell,” &c.—*Ever.* Its situation is unknown. There is still a town of the same name, but not in the same place.  
**42** *Cruel.* The Medes will not spare for money. v. 3. Is. 13:7.  
**43** *King.* Baltassar, (though he was succeeded by Darius) or Nabonides. v. 31. C.  
**44** *And beautiful.* Heb. “habitation.” H.—He will rush into the fold. C. 49:19. C.—The king of Babylon had ruined many. Others shall destroy him, rushing on like the Jordan. W.

## Chapter 51

**1** *Thereof.* Heb. leb kamai, “of the heart, rising up against me.” H.—Many take Leb-kamai to be the enigmatical name of the *Chaldees*, by a secret combination of letters, (Kimchi. Grot.) as if they were not clearly designated in the sequel. C.—The prophet expresses more pointedly what he had declared in the preceding chapter. W.  
**2** *Fan her.* After the corn was trodden out, it was heaved into the wind. This custom would insinuate the distress and captivity of the Chaldees. Sept. “I will send … scoffers, and they shall treat her with scorn, καθυβριουσιν. H.—They have read ( C.) *zedim* for *zarim.*  
**3** *Mail.* There will be little or no resistance made. C. 50:3. H.—The Persians denounce destruction to all taken in arms; or, according to Sept. and Syr. they exhort each other to fight. C.—“Let him,” &c. H.—Heb. of the Masorets, “you who bend … spare not.” C.—Prot. “against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow,” &c. H.—Heb. is printed *ne tendat tendat tendans* *.* The second word is properly omitted in some MSS. Thus (1 Chron. 24:6) we read *taken taken, achuz* having been put erroneously for *achad*, one. Kennicott.  
**5** *Forsaken*, as a widow, *viduatus* *.* H.—God still considers the nation as his spouse.—*Their land.* That of the Chaldees, ( C.) or of the Jews. Theodoret.—*Sin*, or punishment.  
**6** *Silent.* Jews proclaim that Babylon is justly punished, ( C.) *lest you pa* *rtake in her crimes.* Apoc. 18:4. Prot. “be not cut off in her,” &c. H.  
**7** *Cup.* She has exercised the vengeance of the Lord on Juda, Egypt, &c.  
**8** *Suddenly.* She has not lost many battles; but is fallen at once from being the greatest city of the East.  
**9** *We.* The guardian angels, or Jews reply. Miracles are lost on her.—*Heavens.* Her crimes call for punishment. Gen. 18:21 and Jon. 1:2.  
**10** *Justices.* We had not injured the Chaldees, though we had offended God.  
**11** *Sharpen.* He addresses ironically the citizens of Babylon.—*Medes.* Thus the subjects of the Persian monarchs are commonly styled. C.  
**12** *Standard.* Call together thy subjects and allies. H.—This must be explained of Babylon. M.—Yet all will be in vain. v. 11. H.—*Ambushes.* Herein the valour and genius of heroes was most displayed. Jos. 8:2. Homer.  
**13** *Waters.* Not far from the Tigris, and divided into two parts by the Euphrates. C.—*Entire*, being cut up by the roots, *pedalis*, (Lyran.) or according to the measure of thy crimes. Delrio. C.—Sept. “thy end is truly come into thy bowels.” H.  
**14** *Himself.* Sept. “his hand” lifted up, or by his power.—*Locusts.* Their ravages were equally dreaded. Joel 2:4. Judg. 6:5.  
**16** *Rain.* Thunder and lightning are usually followed by showers. C.  
**17** *Every man*, &c. That is, every maker of idols, however he boasts of his knowledge and skill, does but shew himself a fool in pretending to make a god. Ch. Wisd. 14:18.—*By his*, or “by default of knowledge;” (*a scientia* *.* H.) as the Heb. may also mean. The Babylonians were so confounded, they knew not what to do. C.—Prot. “Every man is brutish by his knowledge.” Marg. or “is more brutish than to know.” C. 10:14. H.  
**20** *Thou*, Cyrus, (Grot.) or more commonly the Chaldees are understood.  
**25** *M* *ountain.* So Babylon is styled in derision. See C. 21:13. Is. 1:10 and 20:6 and 22:1. The city stood on a plain. Some think that its palace and walls are designated.—*Burnt;* unfruitful. This happened long after Cyrus, though it then ceased to be the capital, and became only a shadow of its former greatness.  
**26** *Corner.* No king or conqueror shall spring thence. Alexander thought of making it the seat of his empire, but was prevented by death. Strabo xv.  
**27** *Prepare.* Lit. “sanctify.” H.—Call together all nations to fight against Babylon. W.—Many religious ceremonies were used.—Ararat, where the ark rested, (Gen. 8:4) near the Araxes, (S. Jer. in Is. xxxvii.) or in the Gordyean mountains, in Armenia, where the *Menni* dwelt.—*Ascenez*, or Ascantes, ( C.) near the Tanais. Pliny vi. 7.—*Taphs* *ar*, “the prince.” Nah. 3:17. Pagn. “Warriors.” Chal. “Machines” Sept.—*Caterpillar*, or “locust,” (*bruchum* *.* H.) which resembles more a body of cavalry. C.—Sept. “Push forward the cavalry against her, as a multitude of locusts.” H.  
**28** *Prepare;* “sanctify.” H.—*Media.* Cyrus. v. 11.—*Captains:* generals. C.—*Rulers.* Lit. “magistrates.” H.—Heb. Seganim, a title used once by Isaias, and frequently by those who wrote after the Assyrians ( C.) commenced their invasion. H.  
**30** *Bars*, fastening the gates. C.—Those who entered by the channel of the river, would seize the gates to let their companions enter. H.  
**31** *King*, feasting in his palace, (Herod. i. 191.) or at Borsippe. Berosus. He sent to make inquiries, ( C.) or his subjects hastened to convey the doleful tidings, and thus met each other. H.  
**32** *Fords.* Thus the enemy entered.—*Marches.* Heb. “sedges,” which grew to the size of trees, and were burnt when the waters of the river and lakes were drained. Herodotus (i. 185. 178.) specifies a lake four hundred and twenty stadia square, and says the ditches round the city were full of water.  
**33** *Threshing*, performed by oxen treading, and by rollers, &c. Judg. 8:16 and 2 K. 12:31.—*Little;* about fifty-six years.  
**34** *Dragon*, or huge fish, which swallows without chewing. Sion is here venting her complaint. Ps. 136:8. C.—She shews that Babylon is justly punished for her cruelty towards God’s people. W.  
**36** *Spring;* commerce, the source of her riches; or rather the waters shall be brought out of their usual channels. For many ages ( C.) the Euphrates has been lost in sands, and reaches not the Persian Gulph. Pliny vii. 27. Cellar. iii. 16.  
**37** *Dragons.* This has been the case for above sixteen centuries. C. 50:31. Is. 13:21.  
**38** *Roar.* They shall retain their haughty air and threaten others, when they themselves shall fall ( C.) in the midst of their feasting. Dan. 5:30. Xen. vii.  
**41** *Search*, the city which worshipped the moon, (C. 25:26.) Bel, (C. 50:2.) &c.  
**42** *Sea:* numerous armies of Cyrus, or the waters of the Euphrates let loose. C.—In the days of Alexander, many tombs of the kings were inundated. Strabo xv.  
**44** *Down.* His priests pretended that he eat, (Dan. 14:11) and a woman of their choice slept in the most retired part of the temple. Herod. i. 181.—The prophet derides this notion. The idol, or rather his votaries, ( H.) shall be forced to let go the Israelites. C.—*Fall*, by means of Cyrus and of Darius. C. 50:3. H.  
**46** *Faint.* You may apprehend that your miseries will increase in the midst of such confusion; but no, Baltassar, the last of your oppressor’s race, shall be assassinated by Neriglissor, who will be succeeded by Laborosoarchod and Nabonides. This last shall yield to Cyrus, who well grant you liberty. Baltassar reigned two years, Neriglissor four, his ill-tempered infant son nine months, when his followers murdered him, and gave the crown to a Babylonian called Nabonides, who kept it seventeen years, till Cyrus took him prisoner. This we learn from Berosus, quoted by Josephus, c. Ap. i. On the other hand Daniel makes Darius, the Mede, succeed Baltassar, and after him Cyrus reigned. To these changes and continual alarms the prophet alludes.  
**47** *Idols;* Bel, &c. v. 41.—*Slain.* Heb. “dancers.” The people were feasting. C.—It means also “slain,” (Prot.) or “soldiers.”  
**48** *Praise*, for the just punishment. H.—The crimes were public. C.  
**50** *Mind.* Offer sacrifices of thanks on Sion, ( H.) both Jews and other nations. C.  
**51** *We.* The Jews answer: we are ashamed when we think of these places. M.  
**53** *High.* Her fortifications and ditches will prove fruitless. C. 48:7. 18.  
**55** *Great voice*, or boasting and songs of joy, usual at public meetings.—*Noise.* They groan under affliction.  
**57** *Drunk*, with the wine of fury. v. 39. C. 25:26.  
**58** *Broad wall.* The pagan historians agree not in the dimensions, but allow it was excessively broad and lofty. C.—Six chariots might go abreast. It was 360 stadia long, (Ctesias); or 480 (Herod. i. 178.) that is above 23 leagues, allowing 2,500 paces for each. This author says the breadth was fifty cubits of the *king*, three inches larger than the common one, or about twenty-one inches. Pliny (vi. 26.) improperly applies this to Roman feet, and says the walls were two hundred feet high; while Herodotus assigns so many cubits. C.—There were three different walls. Curt. v.—Cyrus demolished the outer one. Beros.—What remained, ( C.) with the hundred brazen gates, Darius treated in like manner. Herod. i. 179. and iii. 159.—Thus was the prediction fulfilled, and the works of so many captive nations brought to nothing. It is asserted that 200,000 ( C.) daily finished a stadium, (Curt. v.) or 125 paces. C.  
**59** *With.* Heb. also, ( C.) “on behalf of.” Prot. marg. H.—It is no where else asserted that Sedecias went in person, and Sept. Chal. &c. explain it in this manner. Baruch accompanied his brother Sararias, and probably took the letter. Bar. 1:2. Saraias went to petition for the sacred vessels.—*Prophecy*, or of the embassy to speak ( C.) in the king’s name. Heb. menucha, was a caution of Benjamin. It means, “rest;” whence some have inferred that he was chamberlain, (Cant. 3:8) or a favourite. Most translate, “chief of the presents,” Sept. and Chal. as if they they had read mincha, which he carried as a tribute to Babylon. Jeremias gave him charge of the parcel, perhaps before Baruch had determined to go.  
**64** *Sink.* The angel did the like; (Apoc. 18:21. C.) and the Phoceans, leaving their country, swore that they would return no more till a piece of red hot iron, which they threw into the sea, should swim. Herod. i. 165.—*Thus*, &c. was added by the compiler. Sept. omit the sentence, as what relates to Babylon is place C. 28 in their copies. C.—Yet Grabe puts it in a different character. H.—Jeremias wrote a great deal, after the 4th year of Sedecias, v. 59. C.—He here finished his predictions against Babylon. W.—This does not mean that he did not write the next chapter, ( M.) as Cappel allows, (Houbig.) though this may still be doubted. H.

## Chapter 52

**1** *Sedecias* *.* This is purely historical, taken from 4 K. 24:18, &c. Many doubt with reason the Jeremias inserted it, as he could not well be alive at the time when Joakim was honoured. v. 31. If he had written both this and the Book of Kings, the variations which we here discover would not be seen. It seems, therefore, that Esdras or some other has inserted it, to explain the fall of Jerusalem and the lamentations; as a similar addition has been made to Isaias. C. 36. &c. See Grot. C.—The history occurs more at large, Par. ult. W.  
**3** *Revolted*, breaking his oath, which greatly offended God.  
**12** *Tenth:* 4 K. *seventh*, on which day Nabuzardan set out from Reblatha, according to some. But it was above sixty leagues, or hours journey, distant. C.—He entered the city on the 7th, and put his orders in execution on the 10th. Usher.—Nothing of the king’s imprisonment, or of the *city* poor occurs. 4 K.  
**15** *Poor.* He took those of the city, and left the poor of the country. v. 16. C.—Sept. Alex. omits this verse, which Grabe inserts: 16. “And the rest of the people, the chief cook or general, left for,” &c. H.  
**20** *Under* the sea *the bases*, ( H.) or bowls, *which*, &c.  
**23** *Hundred;* four next the wall were not seen, or were *fixed* to the chaptrels.  
**24** *Second* in dignity to the high priest, a chief officer of the temple.  
**25** *Seven:* 4 K. has *five.* But this seems more correct, as seven were commonly employed. Est. 1:10. Tob. 12:15. C.—Two might be taken later. H.—*A scribe.* S. Jerom has *Sopher*, (4 K.) as if it were a proper name, and not an office.  
**28** *Seventh year* of Nabuchodonosor, and last of Joakim. 4 K. Sept. Rom. omits this and the next verse, which are found in Theodoret and the Compl. edit. C.—Grabe supplies all from, *And Juda*, v. 27, to 31. H.—Zuinglius observes that the Sept. have not a fragment of it, and that it has been added by some one to hide the ignominy of the Jews. It is interpolated in the Arab. of the Lond. Polyglot, and seems contrary to the true history. 4 K. 24:14. Kennicott, Diss. 2.  
**31** *Joachin* *.* He had been thrown into prison when 18 years old, and continued there 37 years. It is not probable that Jeremias wrote this. Evilmerodach had also been the same in prison.—*Five:* 4 K. has *seven.* Probably Nabuchodonosor died on the 25th, and his son then resolved to liberate Joachin; which he did on the 27th.  
**32** *Kings*, who had been conquered, and kept at court for parade. C.
