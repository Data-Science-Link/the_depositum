# Wisdom Commentary

This book is so called, because it treats of the excellence of **Wisdom,** the means to obtain it, and the happy fruits it produces. It is written in the person of Solomon, and contains his sentiments. But is is uncertain who was the writer. It abounds with instructions and exhortations to kings and magistrates to administer justice in the commonwealth, teaching all kinds of virtues under the general names of justice and wisdom. It contains also many prophecies of Christ’s coming, passion, resurrection, and other Christian mysteries. The whole may be divided into three parts: In the six first chapters, the author admonishes all superiors to love and exercise justice and wisdom. In the next three, he teacheth that wisdom proceedeth only from God, and is procured by prayer, and a good life. In the other ten chapters, he sheweth the excellent effects, and utility of wisdom and justice. Ch.—Their authority is surely greater than that of the Jews, ( C.) whom Prot. choose to follow. H.—Before they attack us, they must, however, answer this prescription. C.—S. Iræn. Clem. Alex. Origen, S. Athan. &c. attribute this book to Solomon; and, though S. Jerom and S. Aug. call this in question, they maintain its divine authority. Sometimes the Fathers abstain from urging it against the Jews, because they reject it, for the same reason as our Saviour proved the immortality of the soul, against the Sadducees, from the books of Moses alone, though other texts might have been adduced. The Councils of Carthage, 419, Florence, Trent, &c. declare this book canonical, ( W.) agreeably to the ancient Fathers. S. Aug. Præd. xiv. and de Civ. Dei. xvii. 20. &c.—Philo (S. Jer.) the elder, ( W. M.) one of the Sept. (Geneb.) might compile this work from the sentences of Solomon, preserved by tradition, as Sirach’s son did that of Ecclesiasticus; ( W.) or it is styled “Solomon’s Wisdom,” (Sept. H.) on account of its resembling his works, in like manner as the Second of Kings is called *Samuel’s*, though he wrote none of that book. W.—Sixtus (Bib. viii. hær. ix.) and others, maintain, that this was written originally in Heb. and some think by Solomon; being translated by the Sept. But these go too far. C.—The nine first chapters seem, however, to be the production of Solomon, though the latter may have been added by the Greek translator, (Houbigant) who must, therefore, have been divinely inspired. H.—The sentiments are very grand, ( C.) and contain a prediction of the sufferings of the *just* one, whence we may infer, that the name of the author was originally in the title, like that of all other prophets. The arguments which Calmet adduces, to prove that Solomon was not the author of the first part of this work, may easily be refuted. In the New Testament, that part is frequently quoted, whence we may gather, that it was allowed to be the work of Solomon. Houbig. præf. p. 176.—Some style this work Panaretos, as being an exhortation to all virtues. C.—All the five sapiential books (Prov. &c.) are cited under the title of Wisdom in the mass-book. Superiors are here admonished to act with justice, and taught that wisdom is to be obtained by prayer, and by a good life. C. 9. Its effect and utility ( W.) form the subject of the latter part. See Apocrypha, vol. i. p. 597. H.

## Chapter 1

**1** *Goodness.* Entertain just sentiments of the Deity, and avoid all duplicity. This truth is placed in the strongest light in the five first chapters, or preface.  
**3** *Unwise.* He shews that their wisdom is all folly, and that they cannot withstand his power. C.—There are mortal sins of *thought.* W.  
**4** *Subject.* Or “enslaved to sin.” H.—Soul and body are intimately connected, so that the actions of one defile the other, and banish wisdom.  
**5** *Discipline.* The instructive light of the Holy Ghost.—*Understanding.* Those who deny God or Providence, ( C.) and lead a wicked life, are abandoned. H.—*Not abide.* Ελεγχθσεται: “He shall be connected *or* manifested,” shewing that he will not *acquit* the guilty, v. 6. M.—When Solomon fell, his wisdom ceased. Iniquity soon betrays itself. C.  
**7** *That.* S. Aug. reads *hic*, “this who,” more correctly than *hoc*, as it refers to the spirit, ( C.) which having made and filled all things, must be perfectly acquainted with every action. H.  
**10** *Jealousy.* God is *strong and jealous.* Ex. 20. C.—He examines the smallest deviation from the paths of rectitude. H.  
**12** *Seek not* with such eagerness (*zelare*) your own ruin, ( C.) by an evil life, ( W.) or rather thrown not the blame on death, as if you were necessitated to sin. God created man to be immortal.  
**14** *Health.* Good. Gen. 1:31. C.—*Poison*, or medicine, ( W.) *medicamentum* *.* W.—Poison and wild beasts become noxious to man only after sin. It is this which infects the veins. All may derive an antidote from Jesus Christ.  
**16** *It.* Sept. αυτον.—*Death.* The wicked strive M. to draw upon themselves the second death ( C.) as they will not repent. W. Is. 28:15. H.  

---

## Chapter 2

**1** *Right.* He shews how the wicked brought death into the world, and expresses the sentiments of the epicureans, as in Ecclesiastes. The six first chapters are a sort of paraphrase of the nine first of Proverbs, in which the attractions of virtue and of pleasure are contrasted, &c. C.—*Remedy.* Lit. “refreshment.” Sept. “healing.”—*Hell*, or the grave. H.—They reject as fabulous, the accounts of people being raised to life by miracle. C.—They suppose that the soul is mortal, and that there is neither reward nor punishment after death. W.  
**2** *Nothing.* Sept. “by chance.” The epicureans imagined that the first man was produced by the conflux of atoms. Lucret. i. 5. C.—*Smoke*, or vanishes like it.—*And speech.* Budæus would substitute “a little spark.”—*Speech* may be used for “thing.” Our life is something like a spark. M.—Speech is an effect of the rational soul, as a spark comes from fire. C.  
**5** *Sealed*, like one in the tomb. Matt. 27:66. The epicureans were well convinced of the fragility of our nature: but they drew false inferences from it, pretending that we should enjoy ourselves now, as there will be no future life. This they ought to have proved. C.  
**6** *Come.* From the disbelief of future rewards and punishments proceeds the epicure’s life. W.  
**7** *Time.* Sept. Alex. “of spring.” H.—Youth is the spring of life. The voluptuous conclude, from the transitory nature of things, that we should make use of them. Would it not be more rational to despise them? C.  
**11** *Worth.* Strange maxims! which few will dare to proclaim, though they act according to them. C.  
**12** *Just.* Infidels are not content to live in riot: they also persecute the just. W.—This passage points out the conduct of the Jews towards our Saviour, in so striking a manner, that Grotius would assert it has been altered by some Christian. But the Fathers adduce it as a clear prediction ( C.) of the Jewish malice. Matt. 27:41. Mar. 14:53. W.  
**13** *Knowledge.* The prophets spoke to sinners in the name of God, and many of them lost their lives in the cause. Christ appeared as a new star, to promote their welfare; yet this only serves to irritate them. C. Jo. 8:16.  
**20** *Words.* Or he shall be punished for what he has said. Syr. Vat. &c. Matt. 26:61. C.—We shall hence form a judgment of his real merits, ( M.) unless this be spoken ironically; as if the just had foolishly flattered himself with the divine protection. Matt. 27:43. H.  
**22** *Secrets.* The disbelief of mysteries leads to a dissolute life, and to the persecution of the just. W.—The pagans knew not the advantages of suffering, and even the apostles were ignorant of the mystery of the cross, till after the resurrection. C.  
**24** *Envy.* Lucifer thought that the honour of the hypostatic union ( C.) belonged to the angelic, rather than to the human nature; and this he was guilty of envy, ( H.) and strove to become *like the most High.* Is. 14:14. S. Bern. ser. xvii. in Cant. Corn. A. Lap. &c.  

---

## Chapter 3

**1** *Of death*, is not in Sept. During life the just are protected by God, (Lu. 12:7) and still more in death. This passage is very applicable to martyrs. C.—Temporal death is to the just the road to happiness, where they shall not incur damnation, or *the torment of death.* Though the martyrs seem to be utterly destroyed, they pass to joys eternal and unspeakable. W.  
**2** *Die.* In this the wicked are not under a mistake; but they err when they suppose that the just shall be no more. If the hopes of the pious where confined to this world, they would be the most miserable of all. 1 Cor. 15:19. C.  
**6** *Holocaust.* The sufferings ( M.) which they have voluntarily endured, cause them to be pleasing to God. H. Zac. 13:9.—*Time* of judgment, or of death. C.—Sept. “at the time of their visitation, they shall shine, and,” &c. 5:7. Matt. 13:43. H. Zac. 12:6.  
**8** *Judge.* All the just shall approve of God’s condemning the wicked. W.—They shall be invested with power, (Apoc. 2:26. Matthew 19:28) which, like that of Christ, will be of a spiritual nature, ( H.) and will appear most terrible at the last day. Matt. 28:18. Apoc. 19:6. C.  
**9** *Elect.* Sept. add, “and a visitation for his saints.” Charity secures both faith and hope; which, without it, are unavailing to happiness. H.—Those who have the virtue of hope, will await the completion of God’s promises.  
**12** *Foolish.* Dissolute, as the sequel shews. Prov. 9:13. Rom. 1:26. The family of the wicked imitate his conduct, and become his torment. C.—This is often the case. In the moral sense, the sensuality and works of the impious are corrupt. W.  
**13** *Barren.* The Jews deemed this a reproach. But it is better than to have children by a crime. M.—*Fruit.* Her good works shall serve instead of children for her glory, at the hour of death.  
**16** *Perfection.* Lit. “shall be in consummation,” or wholly destroyed. H.—They shall not come to age, or Sept. “initiated.” The pagans excluded the base-born from their mysteries, as the Church does from holy orders; and experience shews, that the fruits of adultery are often miserable, ( C.) and while they imitate their parents, they can have no hope. v. 18.  
**18** *Trial* *.* Lit. “of knowing” ( H.) the works of all. The crime of adulterers is not imputed to their offspring; and it sometimes happens, that the children of saints are cast away.  

---

## Chapter 4

**1** *Glory.* The offspring of the chaste is happy, ( C.) and honourable: ( H.) very different from that of adulterers. C.—Bodily chastity is a great virtue; but purity of faith is more requisite to please God, being the foundation of all virtues. W.  
**2** *Itself.* Virtue extorts the esteem even of worldlings. Antiochus wept for Onias. 2 Mac. 4:37. C.—*Sublatum ex oculis quærimus invidi* *.* Hor. iii. od. 24.—*Conflicts.* In the cause of continence. C.  
**3** *Slips. Vitulamina*, a word, to which the people were so habituated, that it could not be altered. S. Aug. de Doct. xii.—Yet some read better ( C.) *plantationes* *.* S. Bonav. Lyran.—The offspring of the unchaste will not prosper. C. 3:16.  
**6** *Beds.* Lit. “sleep,” *somnis*, υπνων. C. 7:2. H.—Whether the children live or die, they are a reproach to their parents, as those who see them enquire about their birth.  
**7** *Death.* He is always ready; but dies in his youth. C.—Whenever death comes, it is for his advantage, and if he depart in his youth, his immaculate life is to be preferred before the old age of the wicked. v. 16. W.  
**11** *Away.* Like Henoch. Gen. 5:24. Heb. 11:5. C.—“Bad conversations corrupt the best manners.” 1 Cor. 15:33. Is. 57:1. But could not God have supported the just under temptation? Undoubtedly. His judgments are unsearchable. S. Aug. de Præd. xiv. C.—The holy doctor thence proves, that those who die in a just state, might have forfeited it, if they had lived longer. God knew this possibility, and that it would not take place, and his foreknowledge agrees with man’s free-will, which some, inclining to Pelagianism, would controvert. They objected to this authority: and he was therefore obliged to prove that the book of Wisdom is canonical. Ib. W.  
**12** *Bewitching.* Thus the pleasures and goods of the world are well described. For as *fascination* consists in a delusion of the people, who suppose that their senses are deceived by vain appearances; so it is the mistake of worldlings to believe that the objects of their desires are real goods, and contain no danger.  
**19** *Speechless.* The damned shall have no excuse, being condemned by their own conscience, ( W.) which shall be instead of a thousand witnesses. M.—In three words, three different punishments are specified.  
**20** *Against.* Conscience will condemn or acquit those who have no other law. Rom. 2:15. C.  

---

## Chapter 5

**1** *Then.* At the day of judgment. The just and the reprobate know each other’s condition. Lu. 16:20.—*Labours.* Defrauding them of their wages, (Lev. 19:13) or plundering them. Sept. “despised, ( C.) *or* frustrated his labours.” H.—Worldlings deride those who strive to obtain the goods of eternity, ( C.) and think they labour in vain. W.  
**3** *Within.* Or among themselves.—*Repenting.* In despair.—*Reproach.* We diverted ourselves with turning them to ridicule. C.—This change of sentiment ( H.) proceeds not from the love of virtue, and is useless. W.  
**5** *God.* As they styled themselves truly, through the merits of Christ. C. 2:18.  
**6** *Understanding* in not in the Rom. ( C.) or the Alex. copy. H.—Some read “of justice.” Ephes. 5:11. C.  
**9** *Post.* Sept. “fame.”—  
**13** *Virtue.* How quickly passes the life of man, (Prov. 30:18) and how few leave behind them a good reputation! Many of those whose actions are recorded in history, were falsely admired, ( C.) and indeed the scourges of mankind. H.  
**14** *Such*, &c. This is not in the original; but supplied to complete the sense, ( C.) as otherwise the following remarks would seem to be the confession of the damned *in hell*, ( H.) or before the judgment-seat. Castro.—The past time is used to shew the certainty of the event. W.  
**15** *Dust.* Sept. Ps. 1:4. Lit. “like the tender beard, ( H.) *or* wool.” *Lanugo* *.* C.  
**16** *Care.* Lit. “thought.” H.—God thinks and provides for them.  
**17** *Crown.* The Scripture thus represents the glory of the blessed, because there is nothing more desirable than independence. But the happiness of the elect will be to throw their crowns at the foot of God’s throne, (Apoc. 7:10. C.) in whom they find every advantage. S. Aug. ser. i. de vit. apost.  
**18** *Armour.* Sept. “he will take zeal, his complete armour.” H.—See Is. 59:17. Eph. 6:16. C.—The misery of the damned is unchangeable. W.  
**21** *Unwise.* “As we have sinned in all, we are wounded by every thing.” S. Greg. hom. 25. Ev.  
**22** *Directly.* Straight to the mark. M.  
**23** *Casting.* He alludes to the ballista, used to throw stones. Jos. 10:11. These comparisons shew the power of God over all nature. C.  

---

## Chapter 6

**1** *Wisdom*, &c. This is not in Greek, and seems out of its place, being taken from Prov. 16:32 or Eccles. 9:16. C.—The connection with the preceding is observable in the next verse. H.  
**2** **Ve** **r.** **2** **.** *Kings.* The author puts these words in the mouth of Solomon to give them greater weight, ( C.) or rather ( H.) as the inspiration of God is the most unexceptionable authority, and it would be of no service to introduce a false personage speaking; these nine first chapters were written by Solomon, though the original has since disappeared. This has been the case with respect to the original text of Tobias and Judith, (Houbigant) as well as to that of the many canticles and parables which Solomon wrote. H.  
**4** *Power.* All power is from God, and to be respected, even though the magistrate should sometimes abuse his authority. W. Rom. 13:1.—They must render an account to the common master. 2 Par. 19:6.  
**6** *Rule.* How severely did God chastise Moses, David, and Ezechias.  
**7** *Little*, and ignorant. Those in power ought to know, and to perform their duty.  
**8** *Equally.* In proportion to their exigencies, or he punishes all as they deserve. It is not clear that he speaks of grace, as the Pelagians would assert, ( C.) abusing this passage. See S. Aug. ep. cvi. or clxxxvii.  
**9** *Mighty.* This cannot be too often inculcated, (v. 6) lest the great should forget God and themselves. C.—Each must render an account of his charge, and be punished accordingly if he offend. S. Greg. hom. ix. Evang. W.  
**10** *Kings.* Sept. “tyrants.” But this title was nor formerly odious.  
**11** *Just.* Sept. “holy.” The Jewish judges were generally priests.—*Answer.* The sovereign judge, to whom Job and David confidently appeal.  
**13** *Seek her.* With the assistance of divine grace. Deut. 30:11. Rom. 10:6. The advantages of wisdom invite us to seek her. C.  
**15** *Door.* Ready to introduce herself. H. Prov. 1:20 and 8:34 and 9:1.)  
**16** *Think.* With eager desire to be guided by her maxims. C.  
**17** *Providence.* To facilitate our just designs. Prov. 9. M.—She is on the watch to save us. H.  
**18** *Discipline.* We must begin with a sincere desire of instruction, and submit to correction, ( C.) if we would come *near to God*, v. 20. H.—Wisdom is attained by this gradation. W.  
**21** *Everlasting* is not in Greek. Wisdom conducts to the throne, (v. 22. C.) which shall last for ever. H.—The sense of the Vulg. is very just. C. 5:17.  
**24** *Now.* The pagans attributed the invention of wisdom to Socrates, or to Pythagoras. But she proceeds from the bosom of God, and was practised long before their times.  
**25** *Envy.* I will not imitate such. C. 7:13. Wisdom ought to be diffused. C.  
**26** *World.* The wicked is ransomed and healed by the wise. Philo.  

---

## Chapter 7

**1** *Myself.* Solomon acquired wisdom, and all others may do it.  
**6** *Out.* Augustus asked a little before his death: “Have we acted our part (*personæ*) well enough?” Suet.—Life is like a stage; before and after which, all are equal.  
**7** *Wherefore*, as I had no advantage over others naturally, I asked for the wisdom requisite to fill so important an office. 3 K. 9:10. C.—Solomon, whose sayings are here recorded, prayed for wisdom. W.  
**8** *Preferred.* I did not ask for extensive dominions, &c. C.—In Prov. 8:10. &c. as well as here, some things refer to the uncreated, and others to created wisdom. M.  
**13** *Not.* Ecclus. 20:32. Matt. 25:25. Such disinterestedness deserves to be imitated by all the learned. C. 6:25.  
**14** *God.* Coming *near* to him. C. 6:20 and 1 Cor. 6:16. The wise do not seek for glory; but it follow them.  
**15** *Would.* With sincerity, and in a sententious and captivating manner. 3 K. 9:24. C.—*Thoughts. Præsumere* has this meaning. H.—Presumption is far removed from true wisdom. Solomon manifested his greatness of soul by his buildings, and wise regulations.  
**18** *Times.* Or “things.” S. Amb. Abr. ii. 7.—Times past, present, and future, (Orig. hom. xxi.) or the three seasons;; autumn, the *beginning* of the civil year, summer the end, and spring or winter, the middle. Grot.—*Their.* The “seasons,” as the Greek implies, ( C.) and the vicissitudes of heat and cold. M.  
**22** *Holy.* These are the proper epithets of the spirit of wisdom, ( W.) or of the Holy Ghost. Corn. a Lap. Lorin.—They may also be applicable to the wisdom which resides in man: *one*, in essence, *manifold*, in its operations, *subtle*, knowing all things; (c. 1:7) *eloquent*, to persuade; ( C.) Greek, “easily moved, or moving,” ευκινητον, ( H.) *active.* Gr. “open ( C.) *or* entire.”  
**24** **Ve** **r.** **24** **.** *For wisdom*, which is the same with the Spirit, and the Son of God. v. 25.  
**25** *Glory.* As S. Paul testifies of Jesus Christ. Heb. 1:3. Euseb. Demon. Evang. iv. 5.—It may also be understood of the wisdom given to the prophets and saints. v. 27. Plato thought this to be a vapour, or fire proceeding from God. In Protag. Philo. de Som.—Some apply the passage to the blessed Virgin. Corn. a Lap. v. 26. C. See Prov. 1:2. W.  
**26** *Goodness.* This is particularly noticed, as he speaks of the favours received. It was also an effect of infinite goodness, that the Deity should communicate itself substantially, in the generation of the Son, and the procession of the Holy Ghost. M.  
**27** *Prophets.* No age or nation has been left destitute by God. Among the Gentiles, Job was a saint. H.—The philosophers also knew God, (Rom. 1:21) and taught many important truths, ( C.) though they erred in other respects, and dishonoured their profession. True religion has always subsisted, and saints, ( H.) yea even pagan philosophers, have borne witness to the truth. Clem. Alex. &c. C.  
**30** *Evil.* Or disgrace. Grot.—The brightest days are succeeded by night. The divine wisdom never fails, though that of man is subject to change, as Solomon has taught us by his own woeful example. C.  

---

## Chapter 8

**1** *She.* The uncreated wisdom is infinite; and the created is the most excellent of God’s gifts. W.—*Sweetly.* God is every where present, (S. Bern.) and directeth all with ease. S. Aug. ep. ad Dard. q. i.  
**4** *Works.* Directing us to imitate them, as much as possible. H.—She teaches us how to refer all to God, ( M.) while mere philosophers stop at vain speculations, and barren admiration of the Deity.  
**6** *Are.* Wisdom is an universal teacher. But she particularly inculcates virtue. All science which has not this tendency is vain. C.  
**8** *Speeches.* Rhetoric, (Grot.) or doubtful matters, as Solomon discovered the real mother. 3 K. 3:27.—*Arguments.* Greek, “riddles,” which were much in fashion. 3 K. 10:1. C.—*Wonders.* Such as comets and eclipses. M.—When Anaxagoras discovered the latter, he durst not write, but only instructed his disciples in secret, for fear of being taken for an atheist, or magician. Plut. in Nicias.—The sciences, which are now common, were formerly confined to few; and the people looked upon eclipses as so many prodigies. The wise man is possessed of all natural sciences, and can predict the changes of weather, &c.—*Ages.* Forming a judgment of futurity from past occurrences.  
**13** *After me.* He speaks to the great, who are more sensible of glory. Solomon’s fame would have continued untarnished, if he had not fallen, ( C.) and we may hope that he repented, and verified this prediction. H.—It is not certain that he obtained immortal glory. W.  
**15** *Of me.* Wisdom is the best protection.—*Good and valiant.* These are the two most essential qualifications of kings.  
**19** *Received.* “By lot,” *sortitus*, ( H.) to exclude all preceding merit. S. Aug. de Gen. lit. x. 18.—*Good soul.* Natural dispositions (Pineda) are perfected by grace and labour. C.  
**20** *More good.* The pre-existence of souls seems to be insinuated, though this is not clear, and the opinion is now rejected. Some are born with a better disposition for learning than others. S. Aug. con. Jul. iv. 3.—Yet none possess any seeds of virtue by nature, or are more infected than others, with original sin, as some heretics would assert. C.  
**21** *Continent* *.* All good must come from God. H.—Chastity cannot be preserved without his aid. S. Aug. Conf. vi. 11.—Yet this seems not to be the literal sense. Solomon prays for the acquisition of wisdom, ( C. Eccli. 6:28 and 15:1. M.) which includes continence, religion, and every virtue. H.  

---

## Chapter 9

**1** *God.* This prayer, which continues to the end of the book, is a paraphrase of 3 K. 3:6. &c. with several additional instructions, to remind people in authority of the love of justice. C.  
**7** *King.* Hence it appears, that the sentiments of Solomon are expressed. W.—*Judge.* This is the first duty of a king.—*Thy sons.* He ought to govern his people, remembering that they are God’s creatures and children.  
**8** *Beginning.* In thy eternal decrees, or when thou madest choice of Israel. H.—The temple was greater, but very like the tabernacle: only the court of the priests was divided from that of the people. In the desert, the whole camp was considered a the court of the latter. C.  
**9** *With thee.* The uncreated wisdom is God himself: that which is communicated to man is his gift. v. 10. W.—*World.* Prov. 8:22. This request shews what idea Solomon had of God’s majesty, for which he was preparing a temple.  
**17** *Thought.* How shall we govern as we ought, and act as thy vicegerents, without thy Spirit? Prov. 16:10 and 2 K. 14:17.  
**19** *Whosoever*, &c. is not in the Sept. But *men* includes as much. H.—The saints have been preserved from the contagion and punishments of the world only by means of the divine benefit. C.  

---

## Chapter 10

**2** *Sin.* Hence it is clear, that our first parent repented, ( W.) and was saved. Gen. 5:5. S. Iræn. iii. 34. S. Aug. ep. xcix. ad Evod. Corn. a Lap. C.—*Things.* Before sin, he submitted willingly; but afterwards, he was forced to use all his ingenuity to preserve this dominion.  
**3** *The unjust.* Cain. We have no proof of his repentance.  
**4** *Cause.* The wickedness of the race of Cain. C.—*Just.* Noe.—*Wood.* Who would have thought that such a vessel would save mankind, &c. amid the raging storms? Noe must have been an able mechanic: ( C.) but God both directed him, and closed up the door. Gen. 7:16. H.  
**5** *She knew the just.* She found out and approved Abraham, ( C.) Sem, or Heber, who took no part in building the tower. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. C. xvi. 4.—*To God.* Many say that Abraham was at first addicted to idolatry. Philo. S. Aug. &c.—But not after he was directed by the light of heaven. C.—*Strong.* Gave his strength to stand firm against the efforts of his natural tenderness, when he was ordered to sacrifice his son. Ch.—*Against.* Lit. “in.” To obey God was true compassion to his son, though it might have deprived him of this life. H.—How many virtues did not Abraham manifest on this occasion! S. Amb. Off. ii. 5.  
**6** *The just man.* Lot.—*Pentapolis* *.* The land of the five cities, Sodom, Gomorrah, &c. Ch.  
**10** *The just.* Jacob.—*Of God.* Or heaven open, and angels ascending and descending. Gen. 38:12.  
**11** *Deceit.* Laban’s craft did not prevent Jacob from growing rich. H.  
**12** *Enemies.* Laban and Esau. C.—*Conflict* with the angel. Ch.  
**13** *Just.* Joseph. Ch.—*Sinners.* His brethren, &c. Sept. “from sin” of adultery. M.—*Pit.* Or prison, to which he was confined at the instigation of Potiphar’s wife, always preserving his virtue. C.—He had also been let down into an old *pit* by his brethren. H.  
**14** *Kingdom.* Which he ruled under Pharao. Gen. 41:40. C.—The Hebrews styled all in high authority kings. Grot.  
**16** *God.* Moses. Ch.—Num. 12:7. Ps. 104:26. &c.  
**21** *Eloquent.* They would, if possible, have sounded forth thy praise. Dionys.—The Hebrews had been kept in ignorance, and afraid to speak. C.—Infants, and dumb people, might also, by miracle, join in the song. H.

## Chapter 11

**1** *Prophet.* Moses, ( Ch.) by whose ministry the Hebrews were delivered, ( H.) and governed with the utmost prudence. Num. 12:2–6. C.  
**3** *Their enemies.* The Amalecites, ( Ch.) and all others, who durst attack Moses. Deut. 3:1.  
**5** *By what things*, &c. The meaning is, that God, who wrought a miracle to punish the Egyptians by thirst, when he turned all their waters into blood, (at which time the Israelites, who were exempt from those plagues, had plenty of water) wrought another miracle in favour of his own people in their thirst, by giving them water out of the rock. Ch.—The Egyptians were thus tormented by thirst, though so near the Nile; and the Hebrews were refreshed in a barren desert. Ex. 7:20.  
**7** *River.* The Nile, to which the Egyptians gave divine honours. C.—*T* *hou.* Sept. “disturbed with corrupted blood, in punishment of the infanticide decree, thou gavest,” &c.  
**14** *By their punishments*, &c. That is, that the Israelites had been benefited and miraculously favoured in the same kind, in which they had been punished. Ch.—*Benefited.* After war, peace is more agreeable. W.  
**16** *Serpents* *.* The Egyptians adored asps, and fed them at their tables, without receiving any harm. Ælian. Hist. xvii. 5.—*Dumb beasts.* Viz. frogs, sciniphs, flies, and locusts. Ch.  
**24** *Repentance.* If people neglect to reform their conduct in this world, they must expect to be treated with all severity in the other.  
**25** *It.* Sin and disorder is the work of man, deserving hatred. C.—God created nothing evil, nor is there any but one God, as the Manichees pretended.  
**26** *Called.* Into existence, or into its proper place. Rom. 4:17.  
**27** *All.* Awaiting their amendment, and unwilling to destroy thy creatures. C. 12:10. Hence thou didst not exterminate the Egyptians at once. C.

## Chapter 12

**1** *O how.* Sept. “for incorruptible is thy Spirit;” which S. Athanasius (ad Serap.) adduces as a proof of the Holy Ghost’s divinity. C.—God loves the soul of man. Grot.  
**5** *Consecrat* *ion.* Lit. *sacrament*, or land. That is, the land sacred to thee, in which thy temple was to be established, and man’s redemption to be wrought. Ch.  
**8** *Wasps.* These were the auxiliaries of the Hebrews. Deut. 7:20. S. James saved Nisibis from the Persian army, by praying for gnats to descend. Theod. Philot. i.—The inhabitants of Belgrade incensed bees, by fire and smoke, to attack the troops of Amurath. Bonf. iv. dec. 3.  
**10** *Natural.* We are all by *nature children of wrath.* Eph. 2:3. H.—But the Chanaanites were accursed by Noe, (Gen. 9:25) and were brought up in wickedness (Ps. 57:4) by their parents. S. Aug. de Bapt. ii. 8.—*Changed.* Because they would not employ well the time allowed them. C.—By custom, malice became as it were natural, after nature was corrupted. W.  
**11** *Pardon* *.* Or impunity. C.—“Thou art angry, and yet are tranquil. S. Aug. Conf. i. 4.  
**12** *Done?* Shall the clay say to the potter, why hast thou made me thus? Is. 45:9 and 64:8. We know, that under a just God, no one is miserable, unless he deserve it. v. 15.  
**15** *Punished.* S. Aug. ep. 106. Some have read incorrectly: “Thou condemnest him who ought not to be punished, and deemest him a stranger to thy virtue,” which S. Greg. (Mor. iii. 11.) explains of Jesus Christ, the victim of sinners; other, of people born in sin, (Lyran.) while some would hence prove the decree of reprobation. Duran.—But it is needless to explain a text which the Greek shews to be inaccurate. C.  
**19** *Hope.* Under a God of such clemency, none should despair.  
**27** *God.* Who destroyed their idols: yet they did not serve him, ( W.) which was true of all the pagans. Rom. 1:21. C.  

---

## Chapter 13

**1** *Vain.* Sept. “foolish by nature, who are ignorant of God.” H.—In this and the three following chapters, the miseries of idolatry are described, to shew the value of wisdom and piety. C.—Without the knowledge of God, all is darkness. 1 Cor. 2:2. S. Just. dial.—*Is. He who is*, must be the most proper name of God. Ex. 3:14. Philosophers could perceive that all creatures had a beginning, and that there must be some first cause or God, whom some confessed, but did not honour as they ought. Rom. 1. W.—*Could not.* Inasmuch as they were vain. H.  
**2** *Fire.* The chief god of the Persians.—*Wind.* Zephyrus, &c.—*Air.* Which is perhaps the wind. Socrates was accused of adoring nothing, but heaven and the clouds, (Aristot. nub.) as the Jews were. *Nil præter nubes et Cœli numen adorant* *.* Juv. xiv. 97.—*Stars.* The zodiac, or pleiads. This species of idolatry was most ancient and general.—*Water.* The ocean, Neptune, &c. The Egyptians adored water above all, as the origin of other things. Hence they were punished first by it. Philo, vit. Mor. 1.—*Moon.* These were mostly the objects of worship, under the names of Baal, Astarte, ( C.) the Phœbus, or Dianæ of the Romans. H.  
**5** *Thereby.* God is announced by the heavens, and by all creatures. Ps. 18:1. Rom. 1:20. “Who can look up to heaven, and be so foolish as not to allow that there is a God?” Cic. Harusp.  
**10** *Of men.* The pagans in general took the material statue to be the residence of a god. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. C. vii. 6. and viii. 13.—The more learned regarded the figures of the sun, &c. as his representations, while others supposed that Jupiter meant the heavens, Juno the air, Vulcan, fire, &c.—*Hand.* This is to abuse antiquity. The idol of the Arabs was a rough stone. In more polished nations, the workmanship of Praxiteles, Phidias, &c. was more regarded. C.—As no creature deserves to be esteemed a god, much less do the works of men’s hands. W.  
**14** *Vermilion.* The ancients greatly esteemed this colour, ( C.) and painted with it the statues of their gods on festival days, and the bodies of those who had the honour of a triumph. Pliny, xxxiii. 6.  
**15** *Iron.* Baruch (6:26) ridicules the same custom, and the other prophets intimate that the pagans took these statues to be really gods, otherwise their practice was no more blameable than that of the Jews, who fastened the cherubim to the ark with gold, and carried them. But the latter did not believe that the Deity resided personally in those images; no more that we do, that Christ is attached to his image on the cross. This distinguishes the behaviour of the faithful from that of pagans. C.

## Chapter 14

**1** *Him.* The folly of exposing one’s life, without necessity, to such imminent danger at sea, is great; though much less than to confide in idols, ( C.) which are commonly made of more corruptible wood than ships. W.  
**3** *Waves.* Of the Red sea, (Vat.) through which the Israelites passed, ( W.) or rather hast taught navigation to Noe, (v. 6) and enabled him to build the finest vessel that ever appeared.  
**5** *Saved.* Before the invention of the compass, long voyages were deemed the effects of rashness, or of great confidence in Providence. C.  
**7** *Cometh.* By which Noe was preserved, (Corn. a Lap.) or criminals are executed. Jansenius—The author foretells the redemption of mankind on the cross. W. Gal. 3:13. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. C. xv. 26. S. Amb. Ps. cxviii. ser. 8.  
**12** *Fornication.* Invention of idols brought people to give way to spiritual fornication, and corruption of manners. W.—They freely practised what was sanctioned by the example of their gods. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. ii. 7. and 3 K. 14:24 and 4 K. 23:7, 3. C.  
**13** *Beginning.* Truth is always prior to falsehood. H.—Josephus (Ant. i. 4.) says, idolatry commenced in the 8th generation, and the Jews assert, under Enos. “Then began the name of God to be profaned,” as the Chal. &c. translate, Gen. 4:26. S. Jer. q. Heb.—The corruption of morals was the natural consequence. v. 12.—*Ever.* Christ shall destroy them. C.  
**15** *Servants.* This was at first done privately, and made the way for public idolatry. Calvin attempts to refute this assertion, maintaining that Laban’s idols were more ancient, and not images. But this argument is nugatory, as *theraphim* may be rendered either *images*, (Prot. 1552.) or *idols.* Prot. 1603. The latter version is preferable, as Laban called them his gods, and the Greek and Latin have idols. It is also certain, that Ninus set up the image of his father, Jupiter Belus, to be honoured by the people, before Abraham’s time; and the fathers agree, that the making of images in memory of the dead, was the first occasion of idolatry. S. Chrys. hom. 87. in Matt. S. Jer. in Osee ii. &c. W.—Nimrod ordered divine honours to be paid to his deceased son. Gul. Paris. Leg.—Yet this fact is not certain. Diophante, the Lacedemonian, assigns the same origin to idolatry as is here given. Grot.  
**18** *Ignorant.* The arts of sculpture and painting may be prejudicial, ( C.) and were therefore banished by Moses from his republic, (Philo) as the Jews were so prone to idolatry. C. 15:4. The case is different with us. H.  
**21** *Name.* It cannot with propriety be given to any but God. W.—The Jews explain this of the name Jehovah, which they will never pronounce. C.  
**23** *Children.* This was done by the Chanaanites, Hebrews, &c. C. 12:23. Is. 57:5.—*Hidden.* The sacrifices of Ceres, Bacchus, &c. were performed in the dark, and horrible impurities were committed. Eph. 5:12.—*Madness.* Before they be initiated in the mysteries of Ceres, or prostitute themselves in honour of the deities of impurity, (Jos. Ant. xviii. 4.) in the very temples. *Quo non prostrat femina templo?* Juv. ix. C.—Many crimes proceed from idolatry. W.  
**28** *Mad.* Like the Bacchanalian women, running crowned with serpents, and eating raw flesh.—*Lies.* The delusions of the devil, or the fraud of priests.—*Easily.* Those who believe not in religion, or in the power of him by who they swear, can give no security by an oath. They fear no harm. v. 29. Yet they are perjured if they believe Jupiter, for example, to be a god, (S. Aug. ep. 54. ad Pub.) and if they do not, they are impious; abusing an oath, which is in itself sacred. C.  
**31** *Just.* Lit. “the punishment of sinners always walketh about,” &c. H.—“The stone does not hear thee speaking, but God punishes the deceiver.” S. Aug.—The pagans supposed that their idols sometimes punished perjury. Juv. Sat. viii.—It is God who does it. C.  

---

## Chapter 15

**1** *Mercy.* The pagans have no real respect for their gods: the fear them not. C.—But we know that Thou governest all, ( H.) and will punish us, if we transgress. C.  
**4** *Us.* He wrote after the captivity, when the Jews abhorred idolatry, ( C.) as they might also do at the beginning of Solomon’s reign. H.—*Picture.* It is not certain that the art was known in the days of Moses, or that he expressly forbade it. Pliny says it was discovered at Corinth, by making the outlines of a man’s shadow on the wall. Afterwards one colour was used, till a variety was found to represent things more perfectly, (L. xxxv. 3, 4.) so as to deceive the senses, for which reason it is styled *a fruitless labour.* C.  
**10** *Clay.* In death, those who have trusted in creatures, shall be abandoned by all.  
**11** *Worketh.* God gives life, and also the rational soul. Gen. 2:7.  
**12** *Evil.* This is the maxim of worldlings. C.—*Virtus post nummos* *.* Hor. i. ep. 1.—Our occupations are like those of children. They presently perish, or we must quit them. S. Chrys. hom. xlvii. ad Pop.—We must strive to act our part well. Libertines deem this life a comedy, and represent religion as an imposition. C.—They are like atheists, as they leave the true God, who seek gain by idols. W.  
**14** In their pride, they threaten more than they can perform, (Is. 16:6) or they take images to be gods, which infants only imagine are men, as Lactantius observes, quoting Lucilius,—  
**19** *Beasts.* They are deformed, ( H.) and seem to have been cursed by God, like the serpent. Gen. 3:14. C.—*Fled from.* Or “have banished” (Lorin.) God’s praise, claiming it for themselves. M.  

---

## Chapter 16

**1** *Things.* Sept. “therefore by similar things they,” &c. H.—The Egyptians were punished for their idolatry by beasts, though they worshipped them, ( H.) being infested with insects, frogs, locusts, &c. (C. 12:23. Ex. 8 and 10. C.) and seeing their first-born perish for their cruelty. W.  
**2** *Meat.* The second time, God gave them in his anger: but still he dealt favourably with his people, (Ex. 16:13. Num. 11:7. C.) punishing them as a father, for their amendment. W.  
**3** *They indeed desiring food*, &c. He means the Egyptians; who were restrained even from that food which was necessary, by the frogs and the flies that were sent amongst them, and spoiled all their meats. Ch.—Ex. 8:3. C.—*These.* The Israelites. Ch.—*New meat.* Quails. M.  
**6** *Sign of salvation.* The brazen serpent, an emblem of Christ our Saviour; ( Ch.) and of the obedience which they should shew to God’s commands. C.—The sign could have no inherent value; but, as a token of God’s favour, was the means of curing the people. W.  
**12** *Plaster, malagma.* The remedy ordained by God was not naturally efficacious. C.—“Every wound of the soul has its medicine in the Scriptures.” S. Aug. Psalm xxxvi.  
**17** **7** **.** *The fire had more force.* Viz. When the fire and hail mingled together laid waste the land of Egypt. Ex. 9. Ch.—This destroyed the useful cattle, but not such as infested the Egyptians. W.—The water seemed to nourish the flames. 3 K. 18:39.  
**18** *Mitigated.* The Egyptians could not banish the insects with fire and smoke, (Jans.) or the storm sent by God, did not exterminate the sciniphs, which had caused the magicians to acknowledge a miracle. Ex. 8:18. The frogs and flies were already gone. Ib. 11 and 31. C.  
**20** *Angels.* See Ex. 16. W.—If angels stood in need of food, they could have nothing more delicious. So water is styled *honey*, to denote its excellence. Ps. 77:25. Lev. 20:24. Joel 3:18.—*Taste.* These expressions are figurative. C.  
**21** *Sustenance.* Lit. “substance,” which some explain ( C.) of God himself preparing this delicious food. Naz. or. xlix.—*Liked.* So that if a person wished to eat an egg, &c. the manna became one, without altering its appearance, which is the case in the blessed Eucharist. Valentia, 4 disp. 6. &c.—But this opinion supposes a continued miracle, which seems not necessary, and it is generally believed that the taste alone was changed, which S. Aug. and others restrain to God’s *faithful* servants, otherwise the Hebrews could not have been disgusted with manna. Num. 11:6 and 21:5. To these it was therefore simply manna. But the others found in it whatever they could desire. S. Greg. Mor. vi. 9.—Yet according to others, ( H.) both enjoyed the same privilege. M.—We cannot account for men’s fancies.  
**26** *Word.* Deut. 8:3. Matt. 4:4. Fruits, of themselves, could not support man. C.  
**28** *Light.* Those who desire to receive any favour must seek it with diligence, as the manna was to be gathered before sun-rise. Clarius. C.  
**29** *Wat* *er.* The ungrateful and negligent shall find their hopes frustrated, ( C.) as well as the wicked, who expect salvation ( W.) without a change of manners. H.—Ingratitude stops the fountain of grace. M.  

---

## Chapter 17

**1** *Souls.* The Egyptians, who were punished with horrible darkness, as they had followed an unjust, dark, and cruel policy against the Hebrews.  
**2** *Providence*, and day-light, like incorrigible slaves, in prison. C.—The Egyptians were three days in darkness, (Ex. 10:22) and the Gentiles continued without faith in God, till after Christ’s resurrection. W.—Only few served him, before that glorious event.  
**3** *Sins.* This interior darkness was punished with the exterior one. C.—*Forgetfulness.* Of each other, being concerned only for themselves, ( H.) or they seemed to be forgotten by Providence, or buried in *Lethean*, most dismal obscurity. The interpreter thus mentions Cocytus, without sanctioning poetical fables. Job 21:33. M.—*Exceeding.* Greek, “spectres.” C.  
**6** *Fire.* Like lightning, which would not allow them leisure to distinguish objects. C.  
**7** *Rebuked.* Or chastised. H.—The magicians could not imitate this miracle, nor secure themselves from its horrors. C.  
**9** *Fear.* the Egyptians kept serpents in their houses, and fed them. But now, neglecting to shew this attention, they were affrighted with their hissing.—*Air.* Or could live. They seemed to wish for death, ( C.) like the damned, but it fled from them. H.  
**10** *Things.* The wicked are most cowardly. C.—“Crimes may be safe; they cannot be secure.” Sen. ep. xcvii.  
**11** *Thought.* And giving way to despair, when it is extreme.  
**12** *Expectation.* Or fear. Such an one is filled with a mortal anxiety.  
**14** *Them.* From the sight of spectres, and remorse of conscience.  
**15** *Irons.* Darkness forced them to stay where they were. C.  
**17** *Birds.* Nothing can afford comfort to the affrighted. M.  

---

## Chapter 18

**1** *Their.* The Hebrews’ ( M.) or rather the Egyptians’ *voice.* The land of Gossen was preserved from these horrors, ( C.) though such Egyptians as might be found there, were exposed to them; and their dismal lamentations made the people of God appreciate their own happiness. They are styled *saints*, ( H.) as the Church is holy, and has always some saints in her society. Out of it there is no sanctity. W.  
**3** *Therefore.* “Instead of those things,” (Gr.) darkness and complaints, ( H.) God led away his people in triumph. Hab. 3:3.—*A harmless sun.* A light that should not hurt or molest them; but that should be an agreeable guest to them; ( Ch.) or the desert should receive them, where they should be provided with food. M.  
**4** *Was.* Lit. “began.” H.—In Egypt, the Hebrews themselves were unacquainted with the law, which was given at their arrival at Sinai, and by means of the Greek version, and the propagation of the gospel, it was more divulged. C.—The unwritten law was, however, better preserved in that nation, than in any other: and the Jews were selected, in order that they might communicate the treasure to all. H.  
**5** *One child.* Viz. Moses. Ch.—He was preserved to be the leader of the Hebrews, when the Egyptians were drowned ( W.) in the Red Sea. M.  
**6** *Fathers.* God had assured the patriarchs, that he would visit his people, and Moses had told them what would take place, during the night of their deliverance. Ex. 4:22 and 11:4. C.  
**9** *Men.* The patriarchs. Their children, the Israelites, offered in private the sacrifice of the paschal lamb; and were regulating what they were to do in their journey, when that last and most dreadful plague was coming upon their enemies. Ch.—*Alike.* The feast was a bond of union with God and their neighbour, ( C.) and the Hebrews resolved to be always true to one another both in prosperity and adversity. H.—*Fathers.* Abraham, &c. Songs usually accompanied feasts, and the promises made to the patriarchs filled the Hebrews with confidence that they would shortly take possession of Chanaan. C.  
**12** *Noblest.* The first-born ( Ch.) of Pharao, and those of slaves and cattle, were slain. Ex. 12. C.  
**14** *Course.* This description of the decree, or angel of the Lord, is most magnificent. The Church applies it to Christ’s nativity, who is thought to have been born at midnight. C.—It insinuates his coming, when the world should enjoy a profound peace, though buried in the darkness of ignorance. W.  
**17** *Visions.* These informed the Egyptians, that their miseries were not to be attributed to any natural cause. The dying proclaimed the same, as Moses had done. Ex. 11:4.  
**23** *Living.* Whom the angel was prevented from attacking. Num. 16:47. C.  
**24** *Priestly.* Lit. robe of the *poderis*, ( H.) “reaching down to the feet,” and made of sky-blue linen, with pomegranates and bells at the bottom. C.—The colours represented the four elements. H.—See S. Jer. ep. cxxviii. Joseph. iii. 8.—*Fathers.* The twelve descendants of Jacob, whose names appeared in the stones of the breast-plate. Ex. 28:17.—*Majesty.* On a golden plate worn by the high priest on his forehead, was inscribed “Holiness to the Lord.” Ib. 36. C.—*Sanctitas Jehova* *.* M.  
**25** *Afraid.* Or shewed a regard for them. H.—Great is the power of a saint, of holy vestments, and of prayer. M.—*Enough.* God did not intend to exterminate his people, as he had done the first-born of Egypt. C.  

---

## Chapter 19

**1** *Knew.* God foresaw the malice of the Egyptians against his people, but as not the author of it. W.  
**2** *Care.* Lit. “solicitude,” ( H.) so that they would not allow them time to prepare victuals.  
**4** *Necessity.* God permitted them to be blinded by their own obstinacy. C.—They rushed headlong into the channel of the Red Sea. H.  
**6** *Beginning.* It seemed susceptible of any form; and the elements appeared to be of another nature. The fire burnt in water, the sea retired, &c. C. 5:21 and 16:24.  
**7** *Field.* Like a meadow, ( C.) *germinans*, “growing grass.” Sept. H.—Pliny (xiii. 25.) attests, that “the Red Sea, and all the eastern ocean, are full of wood.” The Hebrews passed with as much ease as in a *desert*, (Ps. 105:9. Is. 63:13) or place of pasture, while the sea seemed to be in quest of other channels. C. Gen. 1:9. H.  
**12** *Thunders.* Which took place at the destruction of Sodom, for their warning. C.  
**14** *In another.* Lit. “but there was another respect (*or* punishment) of them, because unwillingly they received strangers.” Gen. 19:1. H.—The Amorrhites would not admit the Israelites. Num. 21:21. W.  
**15** *Laws.* Or “rights,” *justitiis* *.* The Hebrews acknowledged the civil authority ( M.) of Pharao, though they adopted not his religion. C. 18:4. H.  
**17** *Changed.* The meaning is, that whatever changes God wrought in the elements by miracles in favour of his people, they still kept their harmony by obeying his will. Ch.—He answers the objection of philosophers, who argued against the possibility of miracles, as being against the established laws of nature. But they induce no more confusion than the various strings of a harp, when they are touched with skill, though they have each their respective name and sound. The ancients frequently compared the harmony of the universe to a musical instrument. See plut. Macrob. som. ii.—*Sight.* Sept. add, “of what happened” ( H.) in those miraculous changes.  
**18** *Water.* Men, &c. passed through the Red Sea, while frogs got into houses.  
**20** *Therein.* For the punishment of the Egyptians. C. 16:18. C.—*Food.* Manna. Ch.—Sept. “immortal food,” ambrosia. H.—*Place.* This conclusion agrees very well with the preceding observations. But it seems some thing should be said respecting the original petition for wisdom; whence we conclude, with Grotius, that the work is imperfect: ( C.) though this is by no means clear, as the prayer is sufficiently expressed in the nine first chapters, if not in the whole book, and God answers it, 3 K. 9. H.
