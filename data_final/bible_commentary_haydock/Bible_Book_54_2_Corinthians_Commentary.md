# 2 Corinthians Commentary

**The** subject and design of this second Epistle to the Corinthians, is much the same as of the former. He comforts and congratulates with those who were now reformed by his admonitions. He blames the faulty with apostolical liberty; and being forced to justify himself and his proceedings against the upstart false teachers, he gives an ample account of his sufferings, and also of the favours and graces, which God had bestowed upon him. This Epistle was written not long after the first, (an. 57.) some months before that to the Romans, from some place in Macedonia, perhaps from Philippi, as marked at the end of divers Greek copies, though it is observed, that those subscriptions are not much to be relied upon. Wi.—In this Epistle S. Paul comforts those who are now reformed by his admonitions to them in the former, and absolves the incestuous man on doing penance, whom he had before excommunicated for his crime. Hence he treats of true penance, and of the dignity of the ministers of the New Testament. He cautions the faithful against false teachers, and the society of infidels. He gives an account of his sufferings, and also of the favours and graces which God hath bestowed on him. Ch.—S. Paul, not being able to come to the Corinthians as soon as he had promised, writes this Epistle to inform them, that it was not through inconstancy, but on account of several weighty reasons, which had hitherto hindered him. Several other reasons, likewise, compelled him to write. For during his absence, several false teachers of the Jews had come amongst them, teaching them that it was necessary to observe the law of Moses, in order to be saved. S. Paul, therefore, first excuses himself, by saying, that the afflictions and troubles he had met with, had hindered him from coming to them. He next orders the fornicator to be restored to favour; after which, he extols his apostleship, forming a comparison between the law of Christ, and of Moses, wherein he blames the false teachers. He then subjoins an exhortation to a pious and holy life, with liberality in their alms, after the example of the Macedonians. As the false teachers had been very industrious in establishing their own reputation, by detracting from that of S. Paul, he enumerates his own sufferings, and the favours he had received from God, shewing that he had much more reason to glory than they; and concludes by exhorting them to correct those faults with which they still remained infected. Estius.—This letter may be justly appreciated as a perfect masterpiece of that animated and solid eloquence, which all interpreters so much admire in S. Paul. V.

## Chapter 1

**1** S. Timothy, it appears, had been sent to Corinth to confirm the faithful in the doctrine which they had received from S. Paul. After he had fulfilled this commission, he returned to S. Paul, and gave him an account how they had behaved, and what good effects his first letter had produced. He styles him brother, to conciliate to him the esteem and respect of the Corinthians. This epistle is not merely addressed to the Corinthians, but to all Achaia, of which Corinth was the capital. Estius.—Others think that Timothy had left Corinth before S. Paul’s first epistle had arrived thither; and that this determined S. Paul to send Titus with another disciple thither. See 2 Cor. 12:18. From him S. Paul had the consolation to learn the happy effects produced by his first letter. See ibid. 6:7, 11.  
**4** *Wherewith we also are exhorted by God.* The Latin interpreter sometimes translates the same Greek word by *exhorted*, sometimes by *comforted:* so the sense may be, *with whic* *h we are comforted by God.* Wi.—S. Paul knew that his former letter had afflicted them exceedingly; here he comforts them by telling them that God had filled him with consolation in order to comfort them. The Greek rather signifies, by the consolation with which we are comforted. Either explanation is sufficiently clear, though the latter is stronger. We may here remark the great tenderness S. Paul had for the Corinthians, since he here insinuates that he had received comfort from God merely to communicate it to them. Calmet.  
**5** S. Paul here styles his own sufferings, the suffering of Christ, to shew that Christ takes part, and suffers in all his members. S. Chrys.—Though it is generally understood to signify the sufferings undergone for Christ. Estius.—If we consider the very intimate union that exists between Jesus Christ, who is the head, and every one of the living members of his body, that is, the Church, that whatever any one suffers, for the cause of truth, Christ is said to suffer, as the Lord said to Saul, why persecutest thou me? and that whatever is given to any indigent brother in the name of a disciple, Christ receives as given to himself, can we want any further proof of the excellence and power of good works, which begin and terminate in charity? A.  
**6** *Or whether we be exhorted*, [1] *for your exhortation and salvation.* These words are not in the present Greek copies; the omission is not of moment, being in a manner a repetition of what is in the same verse: the sense is, that this happens to us for your instruction, and that you may be *exhorted*, or *com* *forted* by our example. This is also signified by the following words, *which makes* you *bear* (lit. *which worketh the* enduring) *the like tribulations, as we suffer.* Wi.—Whatever happens to us, it will always be to your advantage. And certainly it is the greatest comfort when the faithful are in affliction, to see their pastors preaching and planting the faith of Christ, in the midst of afflictions and persecutions. This gives them the greatest courage to bear patiently all adversity, being convinced after the example of their divine master, that *by many tribulations we are to enter into the kingd* *om of heaven.* Cajetan.  
**8** *That we were weary even of life.* [2] The Greek seems to imply the condition of one, who knows not what way to turn himself, seeing no prospect to avoid the dangers. Wi.—The sufferings which we underwent in Asia were so great, that we despaired of escaping even with our life. We were in daily expectation of death; like the criminal, who has been condemned to death, we had no hopes of escaping, but we trusted in God, who has delivered us from all danger, by your intercession, v. 11. He alludes to the tumult raised at Ephesus, and other afflictions which befell him on that account, which, though not mentioned in the Acts, (c. 19:24, &c.) were of such a nature as to make him weary of life. S. Chrys.  
**9** *The sentence.* Lit. *the answer of death*, by which death seemed unavoidable; and this God permitted to teach us not to *trust*, or confide, *in ourselves*, but in him only, &c. Wi.  
**11** *That for this gift*, [3] or favour, *obtained for us by many persons*, &c. The words and construction are obscure, both in the Latin and Greek. It would seem a tautology if translated, *that by many persons thanks may be rendered by many.* Therefore the sense must be, that God must now be thanked by many persons for the benefit in preserving my life, and hearing the prayers of many persons, who before had prayed for my life. Wi.—S. Paul in soliciting the prayers of the Corinthians, did not suppose that this was derogatory to Christ’s mediation, nor to the hope he had in God. And can it be more dishonourable to God to solicit the aid of saints in heaven than of sinners on earth? Or is it to be supposed, asks S. Jerom, that the intercession of our fellow-men beneath, is more available with God, than the prayers of those, who enjoy the beatific vision above. Cont. Vigil.  
**12** *And sincerity of God*, [4] which, according to the style of the Scriptures, seems the same as *in great sincerity.*—*In the grace of God. and more abundantly towards you:* the sense seems to be, that God had wrought more wonders and miracles by him for their conversion, that in other places. Wi.—The apostle here indirectly attacks the false teachers, by saying that his doctrine was always the same, in one continued path of sincerity, and that he made no use of the wisdom of this world, like those false doctors, whose whole design was to insinuate themselves into the affections of the Corinthians by speaking what they knew would be agreeable to them. Estius.—He declares that the subject of his glory was, the testimony his own conscience afforded him of having uniformly acted in their regard with sincerity and truth.  
**13** *What you have read*, in my former letter, or letters, *and known* by my preaching: this he says, to clear himself from the accusation of his adversaries, that his words, preaching, and promises were not to be regarded, saying different things at different times, and promising to come to them, which he had not done. Wi.  
**17** *When, therefore, I had a mind*, and purposed to come to you, *did I use levity?* was it an effect of levity, of a fickle mind, and of a want of sincerity? or do I purpose and promise things *according to the flesh*, to human motives and interest, which make me say, and unsay again, so that in me is *yes and no?* Wi.  
**18** *But God is faithful:* The sense seems to be, as God is faithful, or I appeal to God, who is faithful, that in what I have preached to you, there is not *yes* and *no;* my doctrine concerning the faith in Jesus Christ, is and was always the same. Whether I, or Silvanus, or Timothy preached the *Son of God*, that is, what we taught concerning the Son of God, was not *yes* and *no*, was not first one thing, and then another; *but in him was yes* only, that is, in him, and his doctrine, which we have taught, all is *yes*, firm, and unchangeable.—And *all the promises of God*, of sanctification and salvation, made to us *in him*, by his merits and grace, are equally yes, certain, and infallible; and *therefore by him*, and his promises are *Amen to God*, must needs be true, *unto our glory*, will turn to the salvation and glory of his elect in heaven. Wi.  
**19** *It is*, was in him. There was no inconstancy in the doctrine of the apostles, sometimes, like modern sectaries, saying, *It is*, and at other times saying, *It is not.* But their doctrine was ever the same, one uniform *yea*, in Jesus Christ, one *Amen*, that is, one *truth* in him. Ch.  
**20** The doctrine which the apostle delivered to them was not ambiguous, doubtful, or contradictory, first one thing, then another; on the contrary, it was such, that the apostle could say, (v. 14) we are your glory.—*Amen.* All the promises made by God, with regard to Christ, are fulfilled in him; therefore we may say Amen, and give glory to God, through Jesus Christ, who hath fulfilled all his promises. Calmet.—One of the distinctive marks, as the holy fathers affirm, between separatists and Catholics is; the former are fond of innovation, changes, and reform, the latter are scrupulously tenacious of what has been delivered from the beginning. See S. Irenæus, l. i. c. 18. Tertul. de præscript. S. Basil, ep. 12. Vine: Lyr. See also Les Variations, par Bossuet.  
**21** **Ver.** **21–22** **.** This must needs be true, because he is God, *who* hath *confirmed us with you*, both us and you *in Christ*, in the faith, and grace of Christ crucified, *who hath* anointed us with divine graces, who hath *seal* *ed us*, as it were, by an indelible character, in the sacraments of baptism, and confirmation, and ordination, when we were made ministers of Christ, who in this manner *hath given the pledge* [5] *of his* holy *Spirit in our hearts*, a sufficient pledge and earnest of his graces in this life, and of the glory he has prepared for us in the next. Wi.—By these texts, and Eph. 4 the Catholic Church teaches, that we are anointed and consecrated to the service of God, and sealed with a spiritual and distinctive mark, called by divines, a *character*, (see S. Jer. in Eph. iv. S. Cyril, cateches. 17.) which, as it is indelible, can never be iterated. The same is true of confirmation, and holy orders. See S. Aug. cont. Parm. c. xiii. & Conc. Tarrac. c. vi.  
**23** Now as to my not coming to you, *I call God* *to witness*, that I only deferred my coming out of kindness to you, and *that I came not* hitherto to Corinth, *to spare you*, when by reason of the disorders among you, I must have been forced to use severities against those who were not yet reformed.—*Not that we lord it over your faith*, nor desire to treat God’s faithful with severity, or by shewing the power that God hath given us: but we rather desire to be *helpers* and promoters *of your joy*, that we may rejoice together with you in God. And now I have this greatest comfort to hear that *you stand steadfast* and firm in the *faith* of Christ. Wi.

## Chapter 2

**1** S. Paul continues to justify his not coming to them as he promised. He told them that he did not wish to domineer over their faith, but that his whole design was to contribute to their joy, and that he did not wish to visit them as long as any thing remained worthy of correction, lest his presence should only increase their sorrow. And if in his former epistle he made use of strong expressions, it was not through any design to make them sad, but merely to correct them, by which he manifested his great charity for them. Calmet.  
**2** *Who is he that should make me glad?* &c. The sense is to be gathered from the circumstances. He speaks of the Corinthian guilty of incest, whom he brought to sorrow and repentance, by excommunicating him in his former epistle, and now S. Paul rejoiceth at his conversion. Wi.—The meaning of the apostle is, that if I had come to you in order to make you sorrowful, what pleasure could I have derived from your grief, since you are the only persons who can afford me any, the least comfort? What motives could have influenced me to undertake so disagreeable a mission? This is more fully explained in the following verse, which shows this to be the reason why he had written to them. Calmet.  
**5** *And if any one* (he means the same incestuous man) *hath caused grief*, or caused me to grieve, *he hath not grieved me*, that is, not me only, but all the virtuous Christians at Corinth: *but in part, that I may not charge you all* with this fault. The sense seems to be, *but in part*, that is, it was only one man, and some that joined with him, by showing themselves unconcerned for his scandalous crime, so that I do not blame the rest: or as it was *but in part*, that is, it was only a passing trouble for a little time, since by admonitions and severities, he soon repented. Wi.—When last I wrote to you, I was in great anguish on account of the crime of the incestuous man; but my grief was moderated by the consideration of the behaviour of the rest of the Church of Corinth, which had remained steadfast in faith and virtue. S. Greg. and S. Aug.—It is not the whole Church of Corinth that has caused me this grief, but only one of you: I say this, that you may not believe that I wished to charge you all with this crime. Grotius.  
**6** *This rebuke* already *given him*, may suffice, and I would have you *pardon* and *comfort him*, lest he *b* *e overwhelmed*, and as it were *swallowed up* [1] and *devoured by* and excess of *grief*, so that by the *artifices of* Satan, which we are acquainted with, it turn to his greater prejudice. I wrote, and proceeded in that manner, *to know* by *experience*, how far you are *obedient* to me, and to the ministers of Christ. Wi.  
**9** This was another reason why I wrote my former letter to you, viz. to try your obedience, and your attachment to the faith, and that I might know whether the difference of opinion which prevailed among you had prevented you from being obedient. C.—Others explain it thus: I have written this second letter to you to try your obedience, and to know if you will pay the same obedience to my orders, when I tell you to receive the incestuous man into your communion, as you did when I told you to separate him from your communion. Estius and Theodoret.  
**10** *I also.* The apostle here granted an indulgence, or pardon, *in the person*, and by the authority of Christ, to the incestuous Corinthian, whom before he had put under penance: which pardon consisted in a releasing of part of the temporal punishment due to his sin. Ch.—*Now* as you have *pardoned him* by my instructions, and have received him again into your communion, I also *pardon* [2] *him*, and confirm what you have done, *for your sake*, as well as for his, and dispense with any further severities of a longer penance, which he deserved. S. Chrys. And I do this *in the person of Christ*, by that power and authority derived from Christ, which he left to his apostles, when he said, (Matt. 18:18) *whatsoever you shall loose upo* *n earth, shall be loosed in heaven*, &c. not only in the sight of men, says S. Chrys. but in the sight of God, who hath given us this power. Wi.  
**11** In the name and in the person of Christ, I ordered him to be excommunicated; in the same, I order him now to be re-admitted into your communion, and this for your sake. We ought to take care that the remedies we employ, do not give occasion to the triumphs of Satan, by throwing the patient into despair, on account of our too great severity. S. Amb.—The Gr. may be translated: that we may not fall into the power of Satan, on account of our too great severity. Calmet.  
**12** **, &c.** *When I was come to Troas … and a door was opened to me*, towards promoting the gospel, which I never neglect, yet I *had no rest in my spirit;* I remained still in a great concern for you, not meeting with *Titus*, from whom I expected with impatience to hear how all things went with you at Corinth: I went on, therefore, bidding them farewell at that time, and deferred the good I might do by a longer stay with them till another time. Wi.—Troas is the same town as the ancient Troy or Ilium, famous for its ten years’ siege, when it was destroyed by the Greeks in the year 1184, B. Christ. Estius.—Here, though there was a great promise of abundant fruit, S. Paul’s solicitude to meet Titus, that he might learn from him the effect of his letter, made him depart from Macedonia, where he had much to suffer. V.  
**14** *Thanks be to God, who always causeth us to triumph* by his grace, so that we every where *make manifest the odour of his knowledge*, making God known and worshipped, and instructing the people in the faith of Christ, to the advantage and eternal good of those who hearken to us, and *are saved;* but to the greater condemnation of those, who after they have heard of the truth, by their own fault remain obstinate: so that the preaching of the gospel is to some *the odour of death unto death*, when they remain dead in their sins, they incur an eternal death: and to them who are converted, *the odour of life unto life;* they receive the spiritual life of grace in their souls in this world, and an eternal life in the next. Wi.  
**16** *The odour of de* *ath*, &c. The preaching of the apostle, which by its fragrant odour brought many to life, was to others, through their own fault, the occasion of death; by their wilfully opposing and resisting that divine call. Ch.—*And for these things who is so sufficient*, [3] as we whom Christ hath chosen to be the ministers of his gospel? In the Greek copies and in S. Chrys. we only read, *who is fit?* as if he said, who is fit to discharge this great duty, without the continual assistance of God’s grace? The reading of the Latin Vulgate seems to agree better with the following verse of the next chapter, when he answers their objection, *Do we then begin again to commend ourselves?* Wi.—Who are so fit as we who are chosen by God to fulfil his ministry? If God had not chosen us, how should we have been able to acquit ourselves of so arduous an undertaking? for we did not intrude or thrust ourselves into this ministry. C.—Though it is not so difficult for those to preach the gospel who corrupt its doctrines, who weaken its truths, who disguise its obligations, and who mix the word of God with human inventions in order to be more esteemed, or for the sake of filthy lucre, like those who mix and adulterate their wines, in order to be the greater gainers. S. Chrys.—But we preach the word in all sincerity, as on the part of God, in the presence of God, and in the Spirit and person of Jesus Christ. V.—In this grand work all may justly tremble, for who is fit? as we read in the Greek.  
**17** *We are not as many* false doctors and preachers, *who adulterate* [4] *the word of God*, by mixing human doctrine, to be more esteemed, or for gain-sake. The expression is metaphorical, from the custom of those who mix and adulterate wines, says S. Chrys. for their greater gain and advantage. Wi.

## Chapter 3

**1** The apostle had been obliged, in different parts of his first epistle, to say some things to his own advantage, in order to maintain the dignity of his ministry against false teachers, who had endeavoured to lessen his authority. He is again obliged to shew the excellency of his ministry, and the superiority of the gospel over the law of Moses. Theodoret.—We have not need, he says, of commendatory letters, like those false teachers: we have only to say that we founded the Church of Corinth, and we shall be sufficiently known. Your religion, your piety, and your virtues are renowned in the whole world. v. 2. This is our letter: we have no need to speak: the effects speak for themselves. But still this is not our doing; for we are not sufficient to think any thing of ourselves. v. 5. This letter is not of our writing; we could only do the same as Moses in the old law, prepare the tables, (ministered by us) it was God himself that wrote the ten commandments, and it is God himself that has written this our letter, by implanting his faith in your hearts. Calmet.  
**2** *You are our epistle*, better, and of greater force, than any commendatory epistle, *written* and engraven in my heart, by the love and affection I bear you. You may also be looked upon as the *epistle of Christ*, because of your zeal for the Christian religion, written upon the soft and *fleshy tabl* *es* of your tender affections, with which you have received, and kept his precepts; and not like the precepts of the law, which were engraven *on tables of stone*, which the hard-hearted Jews did not keep. Wi.  
**3** Though the Scriptures be of the Holy Ghost, the proper book of Christ’s doctrine is in the hearts of the faithful, the true mansions of the holy Spirit. Hence S. Irenæus says: “If the apostles had left no writings, ought we not to follow the order of tradition they delivered to the persons to whom they committed the Churches? How many barbarous nations have received and practised the faith without any thing written in ink and paper? l. iii. c. 4.  
**5** **Ver.** **5–6** **.** *To think any thing of ourselves*, that may deserve a reward in heaven.—But Christ hath *made us fit ministers* of his *New Testa* *ment by the Spirit: for the letter* of the Old Testament *killeth*, but *the Spirit* of the New Testament *giveth life.* Wi.—*The letter.* Not rightly understood, and taken without the spirit. Ch.—This verse, (6th) refers to that in the last chapter, where he says: *And for these things who is so fit?* Who is so capable of such a ministry? It is God alone who gives us strength, light and grace. I am far from giving a part only to God, and a part to myself. It all exclusively belongs to him. S. Chrys.  
**7** *Now if the ministration of death:* he meaneth the former [1] law, which by giving them a greater knowledge, and not giving graces of itself to fulfil those precepts, occasioned *death, was* notwithstanding *glorious*, accompanied with miracles on Mount Sinai, and so that the Israelites, when Moses came down from the mountain, could not bear *the glory of his countenance*, which he was forced to cover with a veil, when he spoke to them. Shall not the *ministration of the Spirit* in the new law, which worketh our sanctification and salvation, *abound* with much greater *glory?* especially since the old law was to be *made void*, and pass away.—*Neither was that glorified*, or to be esteemed glorious, in comparison of the new law, the blessings of the new so far surpassing those of the old law. Wi.—If the law of Moses, written on tables of stone, which was only able to cause death, inasmuch as it gave us light sufficient to know what was right, though it did not give us strength or graces to comply with the obligations imposed by it; if this law, nevertheless, was accompanied with so much glory, that Moses was obliged to put a veil over his face, what must we think of the *ministry of the Spirit*, and of the glorious duties of the apostleship? How ought our glory to be manifest, and who is fit for such an undertaking. If I thus extol the excellency of my ministry, do not imagine that I attribute any thing to myself. I am unworthy of this office, which so far surpasseth that of Moses, that his glory (v. 10) could not be truly called glory, when compared with this of ours, which so far excelleth his. Calmet.—The letter of the New Testament also, not truly taken or expounded by the Spirit of God, which is in his Church, must in the same manner be said to kill. See S. Austin, serm. 70. & 100. de tempore. & l. de spirt. & lit. c. 5. 6. & dein.  
**12** *Having therefore such hope, we use much* *confidence* and assurance, and need not conceal God’s promises, nor put a *veil over our face*, as Moses did, the children of Israel not being able to *look* on the face [2] *of that which is made void*, meaning on that passing glory of Moses, to whom the law was given, and of that law, and all that belonged to it, which was only to last till the coming of Christ, and which is now made void. The reading of the ordinary Greek is now different, viz. that they *looked* not on the *end* of that which is now made void, meaning by the *end*, on Christ, who was the end of the law, which now by his coming is abolished and made void, as it was always designed to be. Wi.  
**13** The apostle here informs the Corinthians that the apostles speak with confidence, without any veil, discovering to men mysteries hidden from the foundation of the world; not like Moses, who put a veil on his face that the Israelites *might not look steadfastly*, or might not discover the weakness and short duration of the law, which was represented by the light that surrounded his face, and which quickly passed away. S. Paul here gives the allegorical explanation of the light and veil on the face of Moses. Estius.  
**14** **Ver.** **14–15** **.** *But* the senses and *minds* of the Jews have been *dulled*, hardened, and blinded, so that *to this day* we may say the veil remains over their eyes and minds, and *hearts;* that is, the greatest part of them understand not Moses’ books, prophecies, and those things that were figures of Christ. But they shall understand them, and the veil shall be *taken off*, when they shall be converted before the end of the world. Wi.  
**17** *Now the Lord is a Spirit.* Many expound it, *the Spirit is the Lord.* And where this Lord and this Spirit is, *there is liberty;* i.e. by this Spirit, they who are sanctified are freed from the slavery of sin and the devil. Wi.—We must recollect what he had said before, that the letter killeth and that the Spirit giveth life; that by the Spirit was meant the gospel, and by the letter was meant the law of Moses. Here he says that God is the Spirit, in opposition to the law of Moses; that he is the Author of the liberty of the children of God, in the new law; that in the new law are found the true adorers in spirit and truth, in opposition to the spirit of servitude which animated the Jews. Calmet.  
**18** *We all, beholding*, [3] &c. i.e. we who have been called to the faith of Christ, have received a greater knowledge; and we hope and believe to be hereafter *transformed into the same image*, and to be in some measure like unto God, whom we shall see and enjoy, when we pass from the less glory of grace and sanctification in this life, which is the seed of glory, to the state of a more perfect glory and happiness in heaven, says S. Augustin. Wi.

## Chapter 4

**1** The apostle, having in the last chapter shewn the excellence of his ministry above that of the law, proceeds to inform them of his own labours, &c. in order to destroy the credit which the false teachers had acquired amongst the Corinthians, and to caution them against any attempts that these teachers might make to destroy what had caused S. Paul so much trouble to effect. But he still refers all to God. As for these false teachers, what Churches had they founded? what persecutions have they endured? Calmet.  
**3** The apostle here brings another proof of the sincerity of his preaching, viz. the success with which it is attended: And he says, if there be any who have not yet received it, that is their own fault. For had they been as eager to receive it, as we have been to announce it to them, the whole world had long since been converted. Theodoret.  
**4** *In whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of unbelievers.* [1] Thus the words are placed, both in the Latin and Greek text, so that the true God seems to be called the *God of this world*, as he is elsewhere called *the God of heaven, the God of Abraham.* God, says S. Chrys. *blinded*, that is, permitted them to be blinded. Others translate, *in whom God hat blinded the minds of the infidels of this world;* so that *this world* may be joined with *unbelievers*, and not with *God:* and by the *God of this w* *orld*, some understand the devil, called sometimes *the prince* of this world, that is, of the wicked. Wi.  
**6** *The light to shine out of darkness.* He alludes to what is related at the first creation, when God divided *the light from darkness.* Gen. 1:4.—*In the face of Christ Jesus*, which may signify in the *person* of Christ, who was the *true light enlightening every man, that comes into this world.* John 1:9. Wi.  
**8** *We are straitened.* [2] This, by the Greek, seems the sense of the Latin word, which is taken to signify, one perplexed, and in a doubt. See Jo. 13:22. Acts 25:20. Gal. 4:20. Wi.  
**10** **V** **er.** **10** **.** *That the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our bodies*, when we suffer, and undertake voluntary sufferings for his sake. Wi.  
**12** *Death worketh in us*, when we are under persecutions, and dangers of death, *and life in you*, who live in ease and plenty. Wi.—The preaching of the gospel, which we undertake in such a disinterested manner, and which exposes us to so many dangers, is the cause of death to us, but of life to you. It draws down upon us a thousand dangers and disgraces; but procures you all kinds of advantages. You tranquilly enjoy the fruit of our labour, though we do not envy you this happiness, because we hope one day to enjoy the reward of our labours. Calmet.  
**13** *We also believe*, &c. That is, we have the like faith as David, when he spoke in that manner; we hope and believe, God will deliver us, or at least raise us up from the dead with Jesus. Wi.  
**15** **. &c.** *For all things*, that we suffer, *are for your sakes*, that many may be brought to give thanks, and to praise God for eternity. This encourages us not *to fail*, nor faint in the cause of God, under these *momentary* and *light tribulations, which mark* in us above measure, an exceeding and eternal weight of glory. See the Greek text. Wi.  
**17** *Worketh.* In the Greek, κατεργαζεται, which the English Bible of the year 1577 falsely renders by *prepareth*, unwilling to allow, with the apostle, that tribulation worketh eternal glory. The ardour with which the apostle speaks is sufficient to inspire the most timid with courage. A life full of crosses, labours, persecutions, injuries, &c. he calls momentary and light, if compared with the eternal, immense, and incomprehensible glory prepared for us. S. Aug.—All earthly substance, compared with the happiness of heaven, is rather a loss than a gain. This life, when put in comparison with that to come, is rather a death than life. S. Greg. in Evangel.

## Chapter 5

**1** *Of this habitation.* [1] In the Gr. of this *tabernacle;* i.e. of the body. S. Chrys. takes notice that a *tabernacle*, or *tent*, is not to dwell in for a long time, but only to lodge in for a while, as this life is short; but the *building* God has prepared for his elect in heaven, is for eternity. Wi.—But, although the hopes of possessing this eternal mansion consoles us interiorly, and supports us under the pressure of evil, the obligation we have of purchasing it, even at the expense of our lives, does not fail to afflict us. V.  
**2** *To be clothed over*, signifying the natural desire men have not to die, but to be changed without dying to a happy state in heaven. Wi.  
**3** *That we may be found clothed, not naked*, [2] not divested of the body, as before; i.e. we desire immortal happiness without dying: though some expound it, *not naked;* i.e. not deprived of the glory we hope for. Wi.  
**5** *He that maketh us for this very thing*, (lit. *to this same thing*) *is God*, who created us to be eternally happy, who hath *given us the earnest of the Spirit.* See C. 1 v. 22. Wi.  
**6** *We are absent from the Lord*, and as it were pilgrims. He compares the condition of men in this mortal life with that of pilgrims far from their own beloved country, yet with hopes to arrive there, which makes them willing to undergo dangers, and makes Christians even resigned to death, to a separation of the body from the soul, that they may *be present with the Lord*, and enjoy him. But let every one reflect that he must be judged, and receive a reward or punishment *according* to his works. v. 10. Wi.  
**7** It is only by faith we now walk in this foreign land towards God; we do not as yet feast on Him by any clear view. V.  
**11** *Knowing, therefore, the fear of the Lord*, and how dreadful a thing it is to appear at his tribunal, we endeavour to exhort men to fear and to worship him: and this intention is made *known to God*, who sees our heart: and I hope our sincere manner of asking and preaching is also *known* to your consciences. Wi.  
**12** *We commend not*, nor desire to commend *ourselves*, but they who may do harm to others, and to the progress of the gospel, make it necessary to speak what may give you an occasion to answer their objections, and even *to glory in my behalf* against those who *glory in face*, in outward appearances of learning and talents, but *not in hear* *t*, being sensible themselves that they have no solid grounds of boasting in this manner. Wi.  
**13** *For whether we be transported in mind*, and out of zeal for the good of others seem to *exceed* in speaking of ourselves, it is *to God*, for God’s honour and that of his ministers: or *whether we be* more *moderate*, [3] (lit. *sober*) that is, if I speak not, even what with truth I might, of my own actions, it is *to you*, to give you an example of modesty and humility.  
**14** *For the charity of Christ*, the love of God, the love that Christ has shewn to me and all mankind, and a return of love due to him, *presseth* me on, is the motive of all that I do; because I consider that *if one*, our Redeemer Christ Jesus, *died for all, then all were dead*, and had been lost in their sins, had not Christ come to redeem us. Thus S. Aug. in many places, proving original sin against the Pelagians. Divers interpreters add this exposition, *therefore all are dead;* that is, ought to die, and by a new life look upon themselves as dead to sin, which is connected with what follows in the next verse. Wi.  
**15** *And Christ died for all*, (not only for the predestinate or the elect) *that they also, who live, may not* *now live to themselves;* that they may not follow their own inclinations of their nature, corrupted by sin, but may seek in all things the will of Christ, their Redeemer, their Lord, to whom they belong, who died and rose again for them. Wi.  
**16** *Wherefore, henceforth we know no man according to the flesh;* i.e. having our thoughts and hearts fixed upon Christ, as he is risen, and has prepared for us an immortal life, *we know not*, i.e. we do not esteem any thing in this mortal life, nor any man according to any human considerations of this life; we regard not whether they are Jews, and the sons of Abraham, or Gentiles; nay, *if we have known* and esteemed Christ, as descending from Abraham and David, *now we know him so no longer*, nor consider him as born a mortal man, but as he is risen immortal, and will bless us with an immortal and eternal glory. Wi.  
**17** *If then any be in Christ*, &c. The sense seems to be, if by believing in Christ we are become as it were new creatures, rescued by his grace and his Spirit, the *old things are passed away*, we must renounce all former carnal affections, all sin and all errors in which either Jews or Gentiles lived.—*Behold all things are made* *new:* the New Testament succeeds to the Old, the law and doctrine of Christ to the law of Moses, the Christian Church to the Jewish Synagogue, truth and grace to types and figures, &c. Wi.—With the renovated Christian all his thoughts, sentiments, inclinations, and actions, are new.  
**18** *But all things* (all these blessings of grace and glory) *are of God*, who hath sent his only divine Son, by whom *he hath reconciled us to himself*, by his incarnation and death for our redemption. Wi.  
**19** *Not imputing*, i.e. truly taking away our sins, *blotting out the handwriting of the decree which was a* *gainst us, … fastening it to the cross*, as it is said, Colos. 2:14. And to us, who are his apostles and the ministers of his gospel, he *hath imparted* and *committed* this *word of reconciliation*, by the preaching of his doctrine, and the administration of his sacraments, &c. In these functions we act and we speak to you as the *ambassadors of Christ;* we speak to you in his name, we represent his person, when we exhort you to *be reconciled to God.* “He that heareth you, heareth me.” Luke 10:16. Wi.  
**20** Be not deaf to this voice, harden not your hearts, suffer yourselves to be moved to the charity of God: it is immense, it is infinite. V.  
**21** *Him* (Christ) *who knew no sin*, (who had never sinned, nor was capable of sinning) *he* (God) *hath made* [4] *sin for us.* I had translated, with some French translators, *he hath made a sacrifice for sin*, as it is expounded by S. Augustin and many others, and grounded upon the authority of the Scriptures, in which the sacrifices for sins are divers times called sins, as Osee 4:8 and in several places in Leviticus, by the Hebrew word Chattat, which signifies a sin, and is translated a victim for sin. But as this is not the only interpretation, and that my design is always a literal translation of the text, not a paraphrase, upon second thoughts I judged it better to follow the very words of the Greek, as well as of the Latin text. For besides the exposition already mentioned, others expound these words, *him he hath made sin for us*, to signify that he made Christ like unto sinners, a mortal man, with the similitude of sin. Others that he made he reputed a sinner; *with the wicked was he reputed;* (Mar. 15:28) God having *laid upon him all our iniquities.* Isai. 53:6.—*That we might be made the justice of God in him;* that is, that we might be justified and sanctified by God’s sanctifying grace, and the justice we receive from him. Wi.—*Sin for us.* That is, to be a *sin-offering*, a victim for *sin.* Ch.

## Chapter 6

**1** *We helping*, or in the Greek, *working together*, that is, with God, as employed by him, or as his ministers, and ambassadors, we *exhort* you not to *receive* the grace *of God in vai* *n*, by resisting his interior graces, by an idle, or a wicked life. Wi.  
**2** *Now is the day of salvation*, by the coming of your Redeemer. Wi.  
**3** In this, and in the following verses, S. Paul shews his anxious solicitude not to give any, the least occasion of scandal, lest some reproach might fall upon the ministry of the gospel: for nothing is more likely to cast a blemish on the sanctity of religion, than the want of conduct in any of its ministers. If what they say be true, why do their own lives correspond so little with what they say. This will be the cry of all libertines. Calmet.  
**8** The apostles maintained the character, and fulfilled the duties of the ministers of Christ, equally in prosperity and adversity; they continued to speak the truth, though regarded by the Jews as seducers; exposed to all kinds of dangers, they relied on God, who preserved them, though in the midst of dangers, and of death itself. Though they possessed nothing in this world, yet God never permitted them to remain in want: his providence procured for them all things necessary. Though they had nothing in their possession, yet they procured relief for others, by the alms, of which they were made the disposers, though this latter part is generally understood of the spiritual riches, which they bestowed upon their auditors. Estius.  
**11** **. &c.** Our *mouth is open* to speak with freedom and confidence.—*Our heart is enlarged*, dilated, as it were, with the warmth of love and charity.—*But you are straitened in your own bowels;* you have not the like charity and love for me, nor for all your brethren, and for all mankind, &c. Wi.—The apostle here complains, that the Corinthians have not the same affection for him, which he has for them: as if he should say, however enlarged your heart may be, through the love you have for me, it can never equal the ardour of my love for you. He alludes to those who followed some false teachers, of whom he says a little after: Though I love you more, I am less loved.—*But having the same recompense*, by a just return have the same affection for me, as I have for you. S. Chrys.—Let your heart be dilated for me, and receive the advice I give you as coming from a father, who most tenderly loves his children. A.  
**14** *Bear not the yoke together with unbelievers.* He does not mean, that they must wholly avoid their company, which could not be done, but not to have too intimate a friendship with them, not to marry with them, to avoid their vices. *Be ye separate … touch not the unclean thing.* He does not speak of meats, clean and unclean, according to the law of Moses, nor of legal uncleannesses, but what is sinful under the new law of Christ, and would defile the soul, as idolatry, fornication, &c. Wi.  
**15** Such as have cast off the yoke of God are called children of Belial. John 8:44. Belial, in its radical signification, means without yoke. V.  
**16** The apostle here blames the too great affection the Corinthians had for the Gentiles, who sometimes invited them to their religious feasts, at which were eaten meats which had been offered to idols, and which gave scandal both to the Christians and Gentiles. To draw them from these feasts he tells them, that they are the temples of the Holy Ghost, and that consequently they ought not to make themselves the temples of devils, by eating of the sacrifices of devils. Calmet.—S. Paul, in this and the foregoing verses, clearly shews that the faithful ought not to frequent, on any account, the tabernacles of those who have left the Church. In the old law, Moses was ordered to command the ancients of Israel, on the part of God, to *depart from the tents of those wicked men, lest they be involved in their sins.* Numb. 16:27.

## Chapter 7

**1** *Having, therefore, these promises*, mentioned just before, that God would be a *father* to us, &c. let us *cleanse ourselves* from *all* filth or *defilement of the flesh, and of the s* *pirit*, that is, from all kind of sins. It is not without good grounds, that S. Thomas, and the divines in the schools, tell us, that some sins, as those of impurity, gluttony, and drunkenness, may be called *carnal sins*, bring disorders that in a particular manner affect and defile the body: and that (though all sins whatsoever defile the soul, and when they are such as are called mortal, bring a spiritual death to the soul, by depriving her of the grace of God) other kinds of sins may be called *spiritual sins*, their malice and disorder affecting, and residing, as it were, in the mind or *spirit* of man; such are all the sins of pride, envy, idolatry, &c. Wi.  
**2** *Receive us.* [1] This, according to S. Chrys. and others, is the same as what he said before, *be enlarged or dilated in heart*, that is, have a love, and true charity, and a zeal for us, and for the ministers of the gospel.—*We have injured no one*, &c. He perhaps hints at the ways and proceedings of the false teachers among them. Wi.  
**3** *I speak not this to your condemnation;* he means not to condemn them in general, though some had been blameable.—*Great is my glorying.* I have great *joy* in the greatest part of you. Wi.  
**5** **Ver** **.** **5** **.** *Our flesh*, that is, I myself, *had no rest*, because of the concern I was in about you, after I had written my last letter. Wi.—*Combats without, fears within.* Openly persecuted by the pagans, by the Jews, and by false brethren, I was tormented in my interior, by the apprehensions and fears I have just related to you. I was under continual apprehension, that my letter had been written in too severe a tone. I was in doubt whether the incestuous man would submit to the sentence of excommunication, and censure pronounced against him. And I said with myself, will not false teachers undo, and render fruitless all my endeavours to benefit the Church? Will not my letter alienate their minds from me? Calmet.—Our body had no ease, assailed with a deluge of evils from without, by the enemies of the gospel from within, by fears of new persecutions. Menochius.  
**6** **Ver.** **6–7** **, &c.** *God.… comforted us by the coming of Titus*, and with the joyful news he brought me, of the submission and repentance of the incestuous man, and of the good state you are in, of *your* earnest *desire* to see me. Now I have no reason to repent, that I wrote to you pretty sharply; though my letter *troubled* you, through the concern you were in on account of the incestuous man, yet both *his sorrow*, and yours for his sake, will turn to his, and your greater advantage, with a lasting repentance, such as a true sorrow produces, when it is from God. I see the good effects, by the apology or defence you make for yourselves, by your zealous *indignation*, [2] and, as it were, *revenge* against sin, &c. Wi.  
**9** *Now I rejoice*, &c. I should have been inconsolable, had my letter made you sad, without producing the salutary effect intended by it; but I now rejoice that it caused a sorrow and sadness productive of the great advantages you have reaped from it. Thus in every sentence S. Paul shews the solicitude of a father, seeking nothing but the advancement of his spiritual children. Calmet.  
**10** *For the sorrow*, &c. Sorrow for the loss of temporal goods, such as friends, riches, honours, &c. is productive of no good effects; but on the contrary, it ruins the constitution, exciting in the soul emotions of anger, murmuring, revenge, and brooding melancholy. It moreover betrays an inordinate attachment to creatures. But sorrow for our own sins, and for those of others, sufferings which we endure for the glory of God, work penance unto salvation, which is lasting; or, as the Greek has it, worketh penance unto salvation, of which we shall never repent. For tears shed in prayer unto God are sweeter, says S. Augustine, (Ps. cxxvii) than any pleasure that can be procured from the stage, &c. The tears of the saints are like sweet wine, which inebriate those who love God. S. Aug. Ps. lxxxiii.—Contrition, or a hearty sorrow for sin, and not faith alone, as some pretend, is essential to salvation.  
**12** *I wrote to you not on the account*, &c. That is, not only on his account, or the account of his father, who suffered the injury, (by which his father seems to have been then alive) but also to demonstrate the care and solicitude I have for you. I was also overjoyed to find that Titus was so well received by you, with *fear* and trembling, that is, with so great respect, and submission to him. Wi.  
**16** After these proofs of your charity, and the uprightness of your heart, I can reprehend and correct you, exhort and praise you, without fear of my reprehensions separating you from me, without apprehension that my recommendations will prove false, or my confidence vain; I now reckon you as persons entirely devoted to me, and whose affection towards me will never cease. Calmet. See Grotius, Estius, &c. &c.—I therefore rejoice, as we read in the Greek, after this trial, that you will refuse me nothing I ask of you: and this my confidence I shall shew, by asking you to contribute to the wants of the distressed brethren in Jerusalem, who have suffered so much for their religion.

## Chapter 8

**1** *Grace of God*, [1] *that hath been given in the Churches of Macedonia.* It was certainly the grace of God, that moved the Macedonians to make those charitable contributions for the relief of their poor Christian brethren in Judea, which S. Paul now speaks of: and therefore with those who seem the most exact translators, (even with the most approved Prot. translation) I have, according to the letter, put the *grace of God*, rather than the godly charity, as others would have it, whom I had once followed, and which I think probable, taking the *grace of God*, for a great grace, a great charity, or a great benevolence. Wi.  
**2** *Poverty hath abounded*, &c. The sense seems to be, that in their great poverty, they shewed the riches of *their simplicity*, that is, of a sincere, willing, and charitable heart. Wi.  
**4** *Begging of us the grace*, &c. We may translate, *benevolence*, or *charity*, meaning their charitable alms or contributions. It also may be called a grace, a favour, or a charity, which they did for the poor. He exhorts them to these charitable contributions by the example of Christ, who being the God of glory, made himself the lowest and poorest of men to enrich us with grace and glory. Wi.—*Towards the saints.* The saints whom S. Paul is here speaking of, are the faithful of Jerusalem, who had been deprived of all their property at the beginning of their conversion, by their countrymen, for their steady adherence to the Christian faith, and were now reduced to the greatest want. It is for the support of their brethren in Palestine that the charitable contributions here mentioned by S. Paul, were raised in the Churches of Macedon. Calmet.—In the Greek we read, entreating us to receive the alms which they offered as a contribution to the charitable fund destined for the saints, or faithful, at Jerusalem. See Rom. 15:25, 26 and 1 Cor. 16:1, 3.  
**5** *They gave their ownselves.* That is, they resigned themselves and families to the care of Providence for the necessaries of life, begging that the apostle would receive their alms, which exceeded even their means. C.—And by the will of God they also gave themselves to us, that we might dispose of them, and of all that belonged to them, as we should judge proper. V.  
**6** *We desired Titus.* Having experienced the benevolence and generosity of the faithful of Macedon, S. Paul dismisses his faithful disciple, Titus, to exhort the Corinthians to imitate the example of their brethren in Macedon, laying before their eyes, in the following verses, the charity of Christ, who reduced himself to the greatest poverty and indigence, to shew us an example of humility and charity.  
**10** *Begun not only to do, but also to be willing.* The sense seems to be, that they not only began the last year to do it, to contribute, but that they were the first that had this will, and began it of their own accord, by a motion of their own will. And therefore in the next chap. (v. 2) he *boasted* of their *ready* *mind* to *the Macedonians*, and that their zeal or emulation had incited a great many. Wi.  
**12** **Ver.** **12–13** **.** He tells them that it is the *will* that chiefly makes their charity *acceptable* to God, who sees the heart. And that the design is not to make others live at *their ease*, in a richer condition than those who give, but to make a kind of *equality*, their brethren in Judea being now in great poverty and want. Wi.—God regards two things in our alms: first, the zeal and good-will with which we give our alms; secondly, the greatness of our charities, that is, if they be proportionate to our means. If you have little, give a little, but with good-will; if you have much, give also much, but with equal benevolence and zeal. God measures the extent of our charity by the greatness of our zeal, not requiring of us what we have not, but what we have to spare, relieving others, without overcharging ourselves. V.—Yielding our superfluities, that the poor may not want necessaries. Menochius.  
**14** *This p* *resent time, let your abundance*, &c. The sense, according to some interpreters is, that the time may perhaps come, when they in Judea may supply the wants of those in Achaia in the same kind. Others rather understand it of a communication of spiritual for temporal goods, that your alms, by the assistance of those who will pray for you, and your charities, may obtain for you the spiritual riches of grace, which every one stands chiefly in need of. Wi.  
**15** *He that had much*, &c. The words were spoken of those who gathered the manna. Exod. 16:18. Every one was there ordered to gather such a particular measure, called a gomer, and they who for fear of wanting, gathered more, found they had no more than the measure they were ordered to take, and they, who as it happened, took less, still found they had their measure of a gomer. By this example, S. Paul exhorts them to contribute to the relief of their brethren, with confidence in God’s providence, and without fear of wanting themselves. Wi.  
**16** **. &c.** The apostle then tells them, that he has *sent Titus*, and two other brethren of known probity and honesty, lest any one should suspect, that he, or they should turn these charitable contributions to their own profit and advantage by enriching themselves, *that no one*, saith he, *might find fault with us in this abundance, which is managed by us.* Wi.  
**18** *Brother, whose praise is* *in the gospel, through all the Churches.* [2] It may either signify in writing or in preaching the gospel, so that though S. Jerom expound this of S. Luke, who wrote his gospel, (but probably not till after this time) yet S. Chrys. rather understands it of Barnaby, by the words that follow, *who was ordained by the Churches companion of our travels.* Others also guess it might be Silas or Silvanus. Who the third brother was, is also uncertain. Wi.—Commentators very in their opinions upon the person here mentioned. S. Chrys. and Theo. are of opinion, that this person is S. Luke or Barnabas; S. Jerom also thinks that it must be S. Luke the evangelist.  
**22** **Ver.** **22–23** **.** *With much confidence in you, either for Titus*, &c. Some expound it of *the confidence* which this the third *brother* had in the Corinthians, but it seems rather to be understood of the confidence which S. Paul himself had in them, that they would shew great respect both to Titus, and to the other brethren whom he sent. He concludes, (v. 24) by exhorting them to these charitable contributions, which he calls the *manifestation* of their charity, in the *sight of the Churches.* Lit. in *the face of the Churches*, in your public meetings. Wi.—Most commentators understand here Apollo, but without any certainty. V.

## Chapter 9

**1** *The ministry*, that is, the contributions for the brethren, so it is also called again, (v. 12) the *ministry of this office*, or, as the Greek signifies, *of this sacrifice*, inasmuch as alms, and such charitable works, are spiritual sacrifices to God. Wi.  
**2** *That Achaia also was ready.* Corinth was the capital of Achaia. S. Paul had formerly exhorted the Macedonians to contribute to the utmost of their power, informing them, that Corinth and all Achaia were prepared a year ago to collect alms, and now the apostle, speaking to the Corinthians, encourages them by the example of the faithful of Macedon, and informs them of the greatness of their charitable contributions, and the greatness of their zeal. Theo.  
**3** Titus, and two others.  
**5** *Not* forced from *cove* *tousness.* Lit. not as avarice, as it were extorted from covetous people, who give unwillingly. Wi.  
**8** God is generous to the liberally disposed Christian; filling such as relieve the poor with every species of good, and returning their charities a hundred-fold. M.  
**11** **Ver.** **11–13** **.** *All bountifulness*, [1] by which is signified, a sincere and free liberality, by giving with a sincere heart, and good intention. S. Paul encourages them to contribute willingly for God’s sake, and out of a true charity for their indigent brethren, who will praise, and thank God, and pray for them, &c. Wi.  
**15** *For* *his unspeakable gift.* Such is the conclusion, which the apostle puts to the subject upon alms-deeds. In the following chapter he proceeds to a new subject; but first thanks the Almighty, that he has enriched the Corinthians with so charitable a disposition. S. Chrys. Theo. and some other commentators think, that by the expression, *his unspeakable gift*, is meant the incarnation of Christ. The fruit of alms-deeds is the increase of grace in all justice and good works to life everlasting; God granting these blessings for a reward and recompense of charitable works, which therefore are called the seed, (v. 11. *supra*) or meritorious cause of these spiritual fruits. B.

## Chapter 10

**1** **Ver.** **1–11** **.** *Who in presence indeed am lowly.* [1] Lit. *humble*, (see Luke 1 v. 48) that is, of a mean aspect, as to exterior appearances, and *my speech contemptible*, without the ornaments of human eloquence, but am said to *be bold* when *absent*, reprehending and threatening by my *letters*, which are owned to be *weighty* and strong, let such persons *think*, and be convinced, that *such as I a* *m* by my letters, they shall find me by *deeds*, when I come, and shall be *present* with them. I desire and *beseech you*, that *I may not be bold* when I come, to make use of my authority, nor of those spiritual arms and weapons, of censures and excommunications, nor perhaps of exemplary punishments, which God sometimes in a miraculous manner shewed by his apostles. See the examples of Ananias and Saphira struck dead at S. Peter’s words, (Acts 5) of Elymas struck with blindness for opposing S. Paul’s preaching. Acts 13. He puts them in mind, that the power, which God has given to his apostles, is so great and prevalent, that no force upon earth has been able to resist or hinder the designs of God, as to the spreading of the gospel, and the faith of Christ, and as he expresseth it, to the *destruct* *ion of fortifications, we subverting counsels*, and every thing that opposed the *knowledge of God*, who reduceth whom he pleaseth to the *obedience of Christ.* He admonishes them all to return to the obedience due to him, and the true ministers of the gospel, lest he be obliged to revenge, that is, punish such as remain disobedient. He acknowledges that his apostolical power was given him for the good and *edification* of the faithful, not for their *destruction*, which he will take care not to abuse. In fine, he tells them here in short, and more at large in the following chapter, that they may, if they please, consider outward appearances, his apostolical functions, the miracles God has wrought in his favour, what he has done, and suffered, by which will appear the advantages he has above his adversaries, who spoke with contempt of him. Wi.  
**2** I beg of you now to hear my apology, that I may not be obliged to make us of my authority, when present among you, which they say I have abused, and usurped over you. There is in this discourse a little irony against the facility with which the Corinthians heard the enemies of S. Paul. He alludes to those false teachers who decried his doctrine, by preaching up the observance of the ceremonial parts of the law, for they were Jews, and had introduced many new practices into the Church. We may here take notice, that these observations are applicable to the epistles of S. Paul to the Galatians, and Philippians, for they are the same false teachers whom he there attacks, and who accused S. Paul of being a hypocrite, a seducer, in a word, one who walked according to the flesh. Estius and S. Chrys.  
**4** *For the weapons*, &c. The powers with which we are endowed will easily overturn all obstacles, or fortifications which devils may raise against us. They will easily refute the pride, the learning, and the eloquent sophisms of philosophers, and reduce every height, or high-minded philosopher, to the obedience of Christ. Calmet.—Hence doth our Saviour pray, “I praise thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to little ones. Yea, Father, for so hath it seemed good in thy sight.” Matt. 11:25.  
**6** *Having in readiness.* God gave power, not only to persuade, and to convince the incredulous, but also to punish them, as we see in the examples of Simon Magus and Elymas. What then should hinder him from using the same against these false apostles? But he says, your obedience must first be fulfilled. God forbid that I should first use the sword, before I have tried the ways of sweetness and conciliation. But if any remain obstinate, then I will employ the arms that God has given me. Grotius.—This sweet and forcible example of the apostle is worthy the imitation of all superiors, temporal and ecclesiastical, how ever high their dignity or command. A.  
**12** **. &c.** The following verses to the end of the chapter, are equally obscure, both in the Greek and Latin text.—*We dare not rank or compare ourselves*, &c. He seems to write this ironically, by way of mocking at those, who commended and preferred themselves before others. But I will not compare myself with others, but will only *compare* [2] myself with myself, to shew that my actions agree with my words and my letters.—*We will not glory beyond our measure, but according to the measure* *of the rule which God hath measured to us, a measure to reach even to you.* Here he speaks of a measure, and a rule. By the measure, with which God measured *to him*, he means the places and countries, in which he, and the other apostles were appointed to preach, and plant the gospel: and by the *rule* also prescribed him, he means that it was given him as a rule not to preach, where other ministers of Christ had preached. When he says, therefore, *we will not glory beyond our measure*, [3] or (as it is implied in the Greek) of things *out of the measure*, the sense is, I will not, like false preachers, pretend to have preached in places out of my province, or which were not measured out to me, nor have we *extended* ourselves farther than we ought to have done, when we came to you, for you were within our measure. Nor have I transgressed the *rule*, because others had not preached to you before me, so that I have not *boasted in other men’s labours.* But as your faith is growing, and increasing, when I have sufficiently settled the gospel among you, I hope my measure may *be enlarged*, and that without breaking the settled rule, I may preach also to people and *places beyond you.* This is what seems to be understood by these words, to be *enlarged* or *magnified*, even *to an abundance*, and yet not to glory in other men’s labours, but to glory in the Lord only, and in what we do, as we have been directed, and assisted by him. Wi.  
**13** The apostle here reprehends the vain boasting of false teachers. I will not, like them, say, that I have carried the light of the gospel to the utmost limits of the globe, that I have converted millions of men, avoided an infinity of dangers, performed many miracles, &c. No: I confine myself to the part assigned me by God. I will only glory in having come even to you. This I can do with justice, and without arrogance. Each one has his share, his measure, or his part to cultivate in the vineyard of Christ. Calmet, and V.  
**16** The words, measure, rule, &c. signify through the whole of this chapter a share, or an allotment of any place to cultivate. S. Paul never gloried like the persons whom he is here blaming, that he entered into other men’s labours. But still neither those persons who have come to you, nor we who first preached the gospel to you, have any right to glory, except in God alone. Calmet.—We still hope, that your faith every day increasing, we shall be able to extend our measure much further, and carry the gospel to nations far beyond you, without interfering with any other, by glorying of having built on what they had already prepared. V.

## Chapter 11

**1** *My folly.* So he calls his reciting his own praises, which commonly speaking, is looked upon as a piece of folly and vanity; though the apostle was constrained to do it, for the good of the souls committed to his charge. Ch.  
**2** *With the jealousy of God*, or that came from God: it may also signify a great, or godly jealousy.—*To present you*, that is, the Church of Corinth, *a chaste virgin to Christ*, as the whole Catholic Church is called the chaste spouse of Christ. See Matt. 9:13. Apoc. 21:2. Wi.—I cannot suffer these false prophets thus to destroy what has been prepared with so much labour, but I am not jealous for my own sake; it is for the honour of God; for I do not wish to prepare this spouse for myself, but for God. Tirinus.—It is a duty incumbent on me to preserve you in the purity of the faith you have received, to present you to him as a virgin, holy, and free from every spot or blemish, and hence arise my fear and solicitude, lest by insinuating and designing men, you suffer yourselves to be drawn away from the simplicity of your faith in Christ Jesus, the Lord.  
**3** *So your minds shall be corrupted* by those false teachers, *from the simplicit* *y in Christ*, from the sincerity and purity of the gospel doctrine. Wi.  
**4** *You might well bear* with him. These new teachers pretended at least to preach only the doctrine of Christ. S. Paul tells them, they might in some measure be excused, if they preached a new doctrine, or *another gospel* that brought them greater blessings, or another Spirit accompanied with greater spiritual gifts, than they had already received by his preaching. But *I think*, and may say, I *have nothing less* than the greatest apostles, and you have received the same blessings from me, as others from them. Wi.  
**5** *F* *or I suppose.* Many understand this as spoken ironically, and alluding to the false apostles, who called themselves great. But it ought rather to be understood in a literal sense, that God had performed as many and great miracles by his hands, as by any of the apostles. S. Paul here wishes to refute those who called themselves the disciples of Peter, and other apostles. C.  
**6** *Though I be rude* *in speech*, (as S. Jerom also thought) in my expressions in the Greek tongue, *yet not in knowledge*, the chief or only thing to be regarded. Nay, S. Paul’s adversaries acknowledged that his letters were weighty and strong. c. 10 v. 11. S. Chrys. in many places, and S. Aug. l. iv. de Doct. Christiana, c. vi. and vii. tom. 3. p. 68. and seq. shews at large the solid rhetoric and eloquence of S. Paul, even in this and the next chapter. Wi.  
**7** *Did I commit a fault?* &c. It is a kind of reproach to them, and by the figure, called irony, with a reflection on the false preachers, who some way or other, got themselves handsomely maintained, while S. Paul neither took, nor would take any thing of them, that his adversaries might not have an occasion to say, he did as they did, or that they only did as he did. And lest they should suspect that he would receive nothing from them, because *he did not love* them (as men sometimes refuse presents from those whom they do not love) he appeals to God, how much he loves them. But he will have this to *boast* of against his adversaries, those false apostles and crafty labourers, who cunningly endeavoured *to transform themselves*, that they might be thought *the apostles of Christ*, insinuating themselves into their favour, and receiving at least presents from them, which S. Paul would not do, though it was but reasonable that he should live by the gospel. See 1 Cor. c. 9. Wi.  
**10** *The truth of Christ is in me.* This is a kind of asseveration; I assure you by the truth of Christ, which is in me, that what I say is true, and that no one can deny it in Achaia. Theodoret.  
**12** S. Paul declares that he will continue to receive nothing for his preaching and his labours, that the false apostles may not glory in their disinterestedness; or rather, that he will not, by receiving any thing, authorize by his example, these new teachers, who only seek their own ease, to live on the Church, and to receive their support from it. S. Aug. and Estius.  
**16** **. &c.** *Otherwise take me as one foolish.* S. Paul divers times excuses himself for mentioning things in his own commendation: he owns that this in itself, and unless it were necessary, might be blamed as *folly*, that it would not be *according to God*, but he declares himself forced by them to it, and that he will speak nothing but the truth. See c. 12 v. 6. 11. He tells them that they bear with others that are foolish, even with those false preachers that endeavour to bring them into slavery by their domineering carriage, by making them perhaps subject to the yoke of the Mosaical law. Who *devour* them, that is, their goods and substance, who take from them, who in a *manner strike them on the face*, (v. 20) he means a metaphorical striking them, that is, by imperious ways, and insolent language. Wi.  
**19** I trust that you will permit me to speak in my own praise, since as wise as you are, you have permitted others, who have not greater wisdom than myself. And if it be folly to praise one’s self, as you have pardoned them, I trust you will also pardon me. Calmet.  
**20** S. Paul still continues to speak ironically, that they will permit him to praise himself in his own justification, since they have permitted these false teachers to reduce them to bondage under the law, to devour their substance, and to behave haughtily to them, striking them on the face, &c. Calmet.  
**21** *I speak according to dishonour, as if we had been weak in this part.* The interpreters are divided on this verse; the sense seems to be, I speak what others took upon *as dishonourable in us*, that we had not the like authority over you as these false teachers, and therefore could not keep you in such subjection as they have done. But yet I must tell you, that *wherein if any man is bold, I am bo* *ld also;* that is, I have no less motives to domineer and boast, than they have. And then he proceeds to particulars. Wi.  
**23** *They are ministers of Christ: I am more.* To wit, an apostle chosen and sent by Jesus Christ, appointed in a special manner to be the apostle of the Gentiles, your apostle. Wi.  
**24** The Jews had power under the Romans to inflict punishments, not indeed capital, but corporal, such as flogging, &c. See Mark 13:9. The law, in Deut. 25:3 permitted, but did not command, forty stripes to be inflicted; it strictly forbad that number to be exceeded.  
**25** *Thrice I suf* *fered shipwreck.* This was before the shipwreck in his voyage to Rome, by which we make take notice, that S. Luke, in the Acts, omits a great many things relating to S. Paul; as also when he adds, [1] *a* *night and a day I was in the depth of the sea.* We do not read expressed in the Greek, *of the sea;* but the Greek word is observed to imply the same: and so it is understood by S. Chrys. who gives these two expositions; first, that he was truly and literally in the middle of the sea. Secondly, that he was floating or swimming in the sea after shipwreck, which seems the more common interpretation. Wi.—S. Paul could have avoided that disgrace, as a Roman. See Acts 23; but in Acts 16 he refused to claim his privilege, that he might have an opportunity of converting the guard of the prison. P.  
**28** *My daily instance.* The labours that come in, and press upon me every day. Ch.

## Chapter 12

**1** *If I must glory.* S. Paul in the whole of this discourse shews the repugnance he had of speaking in his own praise, and that if he did it, it was only through constraint, and for the advantage of the Corinthians; as also to defend himself from his calumniators. Calmet.  
**2** *I know a man*, &c. He speaks of himself, as it were of a third person.—*Whether in the body, I know* *not.* If S. Paul himself knew not, how can we pretend to decide, whether his soul was for some moments separated from his body, or in what manner he saw God. Wi.—It appears that this took place about the period when the Holy Ghost commanded that he should be separated for the work whereunto he was called. Acts 13:2.  
**4** *Caught up into paradise.* S. Augustin and S. Thomas are of opinion that this third heaven and paradise are the same place, and designate the abode of the blessed. In order to understand the language of the apostle, we must observe that the Hebrews distinguished three different heavens. The first comprised the air, the clouds, &c. as far as the fixed stars. The second included all the fixed stars; and the third was the abode of Angels, in which God himself discovered his infinite glory, &c. The first is called in Scripture simply the heavens, the second the firmament, and the third the heaven of heavens. Calmet.  
**7** **Ver.** **7–10** **.** *A sting of my flesh*, [1] *an angel*, or a messenger *of* Satan, to *buffet me.* The Latin word signifies any thing that pricks or stings, the Greek word a sharp stick or pale: he speaks by a metaphor, as also when he says *to buffet me;* that is, by causing great trouble or pain. Some understand by it a violent headache or pain, or distemper in the body. S. Aug. mentions this opinion, and does not reject it, in Ps. xcviii. tom. 4. p. 1069. in Ps. cxxx. p. 1465. S. Jer. also speaks of it in c. iv. ad Galatas, tom. 4. p. 274. Ed. Ben. But S. Chrys. by the sting, and the angel of Satan, understands that opposition which S. Paul met with from his enemies, and those of the gospel; as Satan signifies an adversary. Others understand troublesome temptations of the flesh, immodest thoughts, and representations, suggested by the devil, and permitted by Almighty God for his greater good.—*Thrice I besought the Lord.* That is, many times, to be freed from it, but received only this answer from God, that his grace was sufficient to preserve me from consenting to sin. And that *power* and strength in virtue should increase, and be *perfected* in *weakness*, and by temptations, when they are resisted. S. Aug. seems to favour this exposition, in Ps. lviii. Conc. 2. p. 573. S. Jerom, in his letters to Eustochium, to Demetrias, and to Rusticus, the monk. And it is the opinion of S. Greg. l. 23. moral. tom. 1. p. 747. and of many others. Wi.—If there were any danger of pride from his revelations, the base and filthy suggestions of the enemy of souls must cause humiliations, and make him blush. But these are to be borne with submission to the will of God, for his power is more evident in supporting man under the greatest trials, than in freeing him from the attacks.—*Power is made perfect.* The strength and power of God more perfectly shines forth in our weakness and infirmity; as the more weak we are of ourselves, the more illustrious is his grace in supporting us, and giving us the victory under all trials and conflicts. Ch.—*When I am weak.* The more I suffer for Christ, the more I perceive the effects of his all-powerful grace, which sustains, enlightens, and strengthens me: the more also the glory and power of God appeareth in me. The pagans themselves were not ignorant that calamity was the soil in which virtue usually grows to perfection. Calamitas virtutis occasio est. Seneca.—Optimos nos esse dum infirmi sumus. Plin. vii. ep. 26.  
**11** **Ver.** **11–13** **.** *Although I am nothing.* These words are a demonstration of the humility of S. Paul, when forced to speak his own praises.—*The signs* and marks *of my apostleship … on you*, by your conversion, especially being accompanied by wonders and miracles.—*Pardon me this injury.* A reproach by irony, against such as seemed to value him less, because he lived in poverty, and took nothing of them. Wi.  
**14** *Now the third time I am ready to come.* So he says again in the next chap. That is, he was once with them, he had purposed to come a second time, and now a third time.—*I seek not the things that a* *re yours, but you.* That is, says S. Chrys. your *souls*, not your *goods;* your *salvation*, not your *gold.*—*For the children.* A modest pretty turn in their favour, by saying that fathers and parents are commonly supposed to leave their goods and riches to their children, not children for their parents. Wi.—S. Paul came to Corinth for the first time in the year 52, remaining with them 18 months. Acts c. 18. He came the second time in 55, but did not remain long with them; on which account it is omitted by S. Luke in the Acts. The date of this letter is in 57, when S. Paul again came to them towards the end of the year. Calmet.—Other interpreters, with no less authority question this sentiment, see v. 1 of the following chapter, and say he only went twice; the first time as mentioned in Acts 18:1.; the second time, as we may draw from Acts 20:2. 3 after this epistle, as it is evident from comparing 2 Cor. 1:15.  
**15** *I most gladly will spend* [2] all, and even my life, for your sake, and so as to be *spent*, and even *sacrificed*, for your souls; though the more I love you, the less you or some of you love me, a kind and modest reproach. Wi.  
**16** **Ver.** **16–18** **.** *I caught you by guile.* He answers an objection or suspicion of his adversaries, as if he took no presents himself, but employed others to do it for him: he appeals to them, if Titus did not serve them in all things as he had done, in the same spirit, treading the same steps. *Think you*, as some pretended of old, formerly, or of a long time, that we make vain and false excuses to you, and at the bottom aim to be gainers by you? He appeals with an oath to God, that he does *all things* for their good, for their advantage, and *edification.* Wi.  
**19** After having answered one of their objections with regard to his disinterestedness, he thus proceeds: I perceive that of old, or for a long time, you have regarded this lengthened discourse merely as an apology to justify myself from the suspicion of avarice. But *we speak before God in* *Christ;* or, God is my witness that I have acted thus only for your edification. Theodoret.—Seeking not the things that are yours, but yourselves, most willingly to spend our strength and life, and to be spent or completely exhausted for the sake of your souls.  
**20** **Ver.** **20–21** **.** He puts them in mind to be all of them reformed, to lay aside *animosities, dissensions, swellings*, [3] proceeding from pride, uncleanness, fornication, &c. which indeed will be a humiliation and trouble to him, to be forced to use his power by severities; for if he *find* them *such* as he *would not*, they will also *find him such* *as they would not.* Wi.—Των μη μετανοησαντων. This, according to S. Austin, is spoken here of doing great penance for heinous sins, and not merely of repentance, as some moderns would fain interpret it. ep. 198.

## Chapter 13

**1** The third time he had made preparations to visit the Corinthians, (see c. 12:14) when every delinquent shall be tried as the law directs. Deut. 19:15. Mat. 18:16. Heb. 10:28.  
**2** *I will not spare.* Estius, Menochius, and others explain this of the censures, excommunications, &c. of the Church; whilst some are of opinion that he means temporal punishments. But we must observe, that not unfrequently God punished, even in a sensible manner, those who by their crimes had compelled their pastors to make use of the spiritual sword. Calmet.  
**3** *Do you seek a proof?* By the Greek it signifies for you, or in your regard. The sense is, that he has left me power enough to chastise those among you who shall deserve it, when I come. Wi.—I do not know why you delay your conversion. Can you doubt whether it is God who speaks to you by my mouth, who has great power among you, and who is very capable of punishing you. V.  
**4** *He was crucified through weakness.* That is, he took upon him our weak and infirm nature, in which he was made capable of suffering, and of laying down willingly his life for us on the cross. But he liveth again by the *power of God*, of his divine power.—*We also are weak in him*, like him liable to sufferings, undergoing sufferings by his example; *but we shall live with him* by *the power* of God, of which you have also a share. Wi.  
**5** *Try* *your ownselves if you be in the faith.* [1] He does not mean if they have a right Christian faith or belief, but either whether they had a saving Christian faith working in them by charity, or as S. Chrys. says, a faith that shewed itself by the gift of miracles, at that time commonly given to the first Christians.—*Unless perhaps you are disapproved*, [2] rejected, and justly deprived of this gift, which was a proof that they were Christians, and had received the Spirit of Christ. I judged it better to translate here *disapproved*, that *reprobates*, which in other places is often taken as opposed to the predestinate and the elect, whereas there it signifies those who were rejected, and deprived of the gifts of the spirit, particularly of that of miracles, and of those spiritual gifts granted to the first Christians, and which were a proof that they had received the grace: and the 7th verse, *not that we may appear approved, but that … we may be as reprobates.* That is, we wish that we may have no occasion to shew the power and the gifts of the spirit, and that of miracles, but as if we were rejected, disapproved, reproved, and deprived of such proofs. Wi.  
**6** **Ver.** **6–7** **.** I trust that we have not fallen from the state in which we were, but that we continue to exercise our ministry and to use the power which he has given us. Though I do not wish to find you guilty of any sins which may oblige me to use this power over you. I rather wish in this respect to have no authority whatever over you, to be as it were an outcast or reprobate, that you may never feel the power that God hath given me for the punishment of the wicked. S. Chrys.—*Reprobates.* That is, without proof, by having no occasion of shewing our power in punishing you. Ch.  
**9** *We rejoice* that we have not made our power appear in punishing the wicked, and afflicting our enemies; we are glad that we appear to them to be weak; but we are particularly glad, when you live in such a manner as to give us no occasion of reprimanding you, or of exercising our power over you. S. Chrys.  
**10** We write this for the edification of Christ’s mystical body, and to cause all men to enter; not for its destruction, and to compel many to abandon it.  
**11** *Rejoice.* Χαιρετε, bene valete. In this sense the Greeks used this term at the conclusion of their writings; and Λοιπον, to denote that the writer or speaker was hastening to a conclusion. P.—*Be perfect.* [3] Lit. in the Latin *be exhorted.* Wi.  
**12** This was customary with both Jews and Persians, as we learn from Xenophon and Herodotus, and with other oriental nations. And in process of time, from the custom of common life, it was introduced into ecclesiastial assemblies. The ancients were in the habit before they began their meal to embrace each other, to manifest by that sign their mutual cordiality and friendship; then they contributed their alms, that they might give a substantial proof of what was represented by their kiss of charity. P.  
**13** For my part, I wish you, with all my heart, that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the charity of God, and the communication of his holy Spirit, may dwell with you all. Amen is wanted in the Greek, but was added by the Church of Corinth, which was accustomed to make this reply as often as this epistle was read. When we recall to our mind the excess of corruption that had reigned in the city of Corinth under paganism, excess attested by profane authors, and which S. Paul brings to their recollection, (1 Cor. 6:9) we are all astonishment that in the short space of four years the gospel had operated amongst the faithful of this church, such a prodigious change in their manners, and that they were become capable of receiving lessons of morality so very pure as is this of the apostle. Bergier.
