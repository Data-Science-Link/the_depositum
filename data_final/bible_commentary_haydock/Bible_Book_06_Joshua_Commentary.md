# Joshua Commentary

This book is called **Josue**, because it contains the history of what passed under him, and, according to the common opinion, was written by him. The Greeks call him Jesus; for Josue and Jesus, in the Hebrew, are the same name, and have the same signification, viz. *A Saviour.* And it was not without a mystery, that he who was to bring the people into the land of promise, should have his name changed from *Osee* (for so he was called before, Num. 13:17,) to *Josue*, or *Jesus*, to give us to understand, the Moses, by his law, could only bring the people within sight of the promised inheritance, but that our Saviour, *Jesus*, was to bring us into it. Ch.—The Hebrews who had been so rebellious under Moses, behaved with remarkable fidelity and respect towards his successor; who, by these means, more forcibly represented the Christian Church, ( D.) which will be ever obedient to her divine head and observe his directions. Josue had been trained up a long time under the hand of Moses, and God had given him the commission to govern his people, in so public a manner, that no one offered to claim that high and arduous office. In effect, the whole conduct of Josue before and after his exaltation, shewed him to be most deserving of command. H.—Josue, says the Holy Ghost, (Eccli. 46:1,) *was successor of Moses among the prophets*, or, according to the Greek, “in prophecies.” Many explain this of the obligation incumbent on him, to continue the sacred history ( C.) and revelations where Moses had left off. The last chapter of this book informs us that he did so. Perhaps some additions, by way of farther explication, have been made by subsequent inspired writers, though most of the passages which are adduced to prove this assertion, seem to be of little force. Respecting the death of Josue, we may make the same observations as on that of Moses. It may have been written by the author of the Book of Judges. Theodoret seems to have thought that the work before us, was compiled out of the public registers, which are quoted C. 10 under the name of the *book of the Lord*. See Num. 21:14. The Samaritans have a book or chronicle of Josue, which relates in 39 or 47 chapters, many facts of scriptural history, ( H.) down to the reign of Adrian, intermingled with a variety of fables. It seems to be of modern date. Hottinger undertook to publish it in Latin, but was prevented by death. C.—The true history of Josue sets before us the passage of the Jordan, the conquest of Chanaan, and the distribution of the country. After the pious general had performed all that could be expected from him, after he had twice ratified the covenant between God and his people, and exhorted the latter, with his last breath, to observe an inviolable fidelity to the only Lord, he departed this life in peace, in the 110th year of his age, and was buried at Thamnath Sare, which he had built for the place of his abode. H.—As the five books of Moses contain the law, intermixed with history, so this first of the historical books exhibits a variety of useful precepts and predictions. The prophetical and sapiential books must be considered in the same light. W.—They all tend to promote true wisdom and the salvation of men, provided they be perused in the same spirit with which they were written. H.

## Chapter 1

**1** *Now:* lit. *And.* Thus the sacred history is connected, the last chapter of Deuteronomy being, in the opinion of many, a part of the work of Josue. H.—Moses died on the 1st of the 12th month, Adar, and as soon as that month of mourning had expired, and the spies had returned on the 4th of Nisan, God ordered the people to prepare for their departure.—*Minister.* This was by no means degrading. He was designed for the successor of Moses, as Eliseus was to succeed Elias. The heroes at Troy had servants of the same high character as themselves, attached to their persons by the ties of friendship. See Ex. 17:10.  
**2** *Jordan*, a river well known, which rises in Antilibanus, not from Panion, but from the lake Phiala, as Herod the Tetrarch discovered by throwing some straw into the latter, which passed by a subterraneous passage into Panion. Thence it proceeds to the Semonite lake and to Daphne, where it begins to be called the Great Jordan. Joseph. Bel. iii. 33. Having traversed the land of Palestine in the southern direction, it loses itself in the lake of Sodom. C.—It is a very rapid river, and hence its appellation from *irod*, of *jord, descendit*, is very probably derived. H.—The Arabs call it Zacchar, “overflowing,” because the snows and rains cause it *formerly* to overflow about Easter. Univ. Hist.—When Maundrell travelled through this country, the stream was too rapid for a person to swim against it. Parkhurst.—Hence the miracle of the Hebrews passing through the Jordan on dry land, when its waters were the most copious and violent, would be the more observable.  
**3** *Moses.* Thus the preceding permission, which the Jews extend, as if God had authorized them to conquer the whole world, is limited. H. See Deut. 11:24.—Their right to the land of Chanaan depends on this grant of God, who is the Lord of all things, and who thus took away all the privileges of the former inhabitants. But the warrant of destruction only regarded the people of Chanaan. Those who lived towards the Euphrates, were obliged only to pay tribute by David and Solomon, thought their country formed part of what had been promised to the Israelites. They might have possessed all that region, if they had proved faithful. The limits of the promised land vary, as they are considered under various lights. C.—The desert of Arabia Petrea and Antilibanus formed the boundaries on the south and on the north, the Euphrates and Mediterranean were on the east and west, when the territories of the Israelites were considered in their utmost extent. H.  
**4** *Hethites*, the most formidable of the nations of Chanaan. Masius.  
**5** *Resist you.* They shall at last be overcome, and their resistance will prove detrimental to themselves. C.  
**6** Lot*.* Heb. “thou shalt give for an inheritance.” H.  
**7** *From it.* Heb. *him*, Moses. But the Masorets order us to read *it.* H.—*Understand*, or “succeed.” Chal. Vat.  
**10** *Princes. Shoterim* may denote both judges and heralds, such as those mentioned in Homer, the messengers of gods and men, whose persons were deemed sacred. They bore a wand or sceptre, as a mark of their authority.  
**11** *Victuals.* The manna still supplied the army after they had passed the Jordan. C. 5:12. But Josue might fear lest the people might not have liberty to gather it in the midst of the enemy’s country, or he might perhaps suppose that this miraculous food would be withdrawn, as soon as they had entered Chanaan. He therefore takes all necessary precautions, and gets other sorts of provisions in the neighbourhood. C.—This might foreshew, that in the primitive Church the ceremonies and privileges of the old law would not be abrogated immediately, but they might be used for a time along with the rites of the gospel, till the old law should be buried with honour. W.—*Third day*, after their departure from Setim; or perhaps this order was only published when the Israelites were arrived on the banks of the Jordan. C.  
**14** *Armed before*, in order of battle, at the head of the army, and not according to the disposition of the tribes, which were observed in the desert. Only 40,000 men were selected out of 110,580, the rest were very prudently left to guard the new conquered country. See Num. 32:17.—*For them.* Heb. “help them.”  
**15** *Beyond.* The same expression is translated *on this side*, v. 14. Heb. beheber means also, “in the passage.” If we have regard to Josue, when he spoke this, he was *beyond*, that is on the east side of the river, though perhaps ( H.) he might be on the other side when he wrote the history. Deut. 1:1. C.  
**17** *Mo* *ses.* Thus they express their ardent wish, that God would extend his protection to Josue. M.—They do not mean to insinuate, that they will obey him only as long as he complies with God’s law. C.  
**18** **8** **.** *Die*, as guilty of high treason. The person’s goods were confiscated, and became the property of the king. Thus David disposed of the effects of Saul, (2 K. 16:4) and Achab seized the vineyard of Naboth, 3 K. 21:15. C.

## Chapter 2

**2** *By night.* Heb. “this night.” C.  
**3** *House.* She spoke to them through a window. The messengers did not enter into her house; whence Serarius infers, that Rahab was a person consecrated to some impure deity, and therefore held in some estimation among the people of Jericho, as this was a city of the moon, in whose honour such consecrations were generally made. But these arguments are not very convincing. C.  
**4** *Hid*, or “had hidden,” as (v. 6,) she had made the men retire before she spoke to the messengers, and probably before they came to demand them. As soon as she was informed of their design, she took all prudent precautions both for her own and their safety, as she could not have escaped death, if she had been discovered affording shelter to the enemies of her country. She felt herself authorized by God, on this occasion, to abandon those upon whom he had declared war, and who could have derived no benefit from the spies being betrayed to them. H.  
**5** *At the time*, not precisely, as otherwise the men who shut the gates must have seen them, but about that time, ( C.) Rahab pretends that the spies had left her house, and had directed their course towards the gate, so that she made no doubt but they might easily overtake them. H.—Notwithstanding this officious lie, which is a venial sin, S. Paul and S. James testify that she was justified by her faith in God, and by good works towards these men. See S. Aug. c. Mend. 17. and note on James 2:25. W.—Rahab might suppose that an officious lie was not a sin, ( M.) as many great and learned men seemed to have maintained this doctrine. See Grotius Jur. iii. 1. 9. Orig. c. Cels. iv. p. 171. S. Chrys. hom. 53. Gen. She was so far from intending to do an injury to any one, that she consulted the welfare both of her guests and of her countrymen, who, if they had detected the spies and committed murder, would have thus brought greater destruction upon themselves, as they could not escape the wrath of God. C.  
**6** *There.* The roofs were flat in that country, and consequently very proper to dry flax, or “cotton,” as Masius understands.  
**7** *Jordan*, where they had probably come over, though perhaps in a boat, ( M.) and where the messengers concluded they would have the best chance of finding them, as the Israelites were on the opposite side of the river. H.—As soon as they were gone out of the city, the guards shut the *gate*, that if the spies should still be lurking within, they might be hindered from making their escape. M.  
**8** *Asleep.* It seems as if the spies had been ignorant of the danger to which they had been just exposed, and had gone to the roof of the house with a design to pass the night in greater security. Rahab perceives, however, that it would be extremely rash for them to continue with her any longer, and therefore she gives them the best advice, to secure their safety by fleeing in the dead of the night, and without further delay. H.  
**9** *Strength* *.* Heb. “they faint *or* melt away,” deprived both of strength and counsel.  
**11** *Beneath.* This is the confession of a true convert, ( C.) inspired by God. H.—For S. Paul commends her *faith.* Heb. 11:31. M.—The pagans confined the power of their idols to certain districts; the power of the true God is infinite. C.  
**12** *True token*, such a one as, when I shew it to the Israelites, they may preserve me and mine. She is not content with a verbal promise, she requires something permanent and sensible, as a mark of their mutual engagements, ( C.) a token of their sincerity. They afterwards appointed a piece of *scarlet* to be hung out of the house, where those were to be collected who should be entitled to protection. Rahab was bound not to divulge their secret, nor to betray them. If she had instructed others of her fellow-citizens to hand out the same mark, she would have forfeited all her privileges, v. 20. H.  
**14** *Death.* We are willing to die instead of you, if we do not fulfil our promises.—*Truth*, a real and effectual *mercy.*  
**16** *Days;* the remainder of this night, and the day and night following. It is probable that they would travel only in the night time. C.—If they had gone by the high road, they might easily have been discovered by the messengers, who would be on their return. H.—But retiring to the mountains south of Jericho, till they had re-entered the city, the spies made their escape. C.  
**18** *By which* window or cord. C.—The cord was left as a signal. M.  
**24** *Fear*, as Rahab had testified. They might also have been witnesses of the people’s consternation, which gave them the most assured hopes of victory, as the Lord had given this sign, among others, that he would be with them. Deut. 28:10. H.

## Chapter 3

**1** *Days*, in part, as they arrived on the 8th of Nisan, staid there the following day, and crossed the Jordan on the 10th, on Friday the 30th of our April. Thus Christ is said to have remained three days in the tomb, ( C.) though he was there only a small part of Friday and of Sunday, and the whole of Saturday. Heb. “they lodged there before they passed over, (2) and it came to pass after three days that the,” &c.  
**2** *Heralds. Shoterim.* C. 1:10. Prot. “the officers went through the host.” H.  
**3** *Levi.* Sigonius thinks that the Caathites performed this office on this as on other occasions. But the Vulgate shews that the priests sometimes carried the ark, perhaps because it was uncovered. C. 6:6. 2 K. 15:25. At this period the number of priests was but small. Some of the sons of Eleazar and of Ithamar might be old enough to assist their parents: only two would be necessary at a time, though the Rabbins assign four, (which is not improbable. Theodoret) and pretend that the two who went first were obliged to go backwards, in order that their faces might be turned towards the ark, out of respect. The ark now marked the way for the people, as the cloud had disappeared on the death of Moses. S. Aug. q. 3. Masius. C.—It had been carried at the head of the army in the desert. H.  
**4** *Space of.* Heb. adds, “about … by measure.” It was not easy to observe the exact distance in the march. This was prescribed both to keep the people at a respectful distance, and also to enable them to see which way they were to proceed. When the priests stood in the bed of the river, the waters rose up like a firm wall on the north side, while those to the south flowed away into the lake of Sodom, leaving about 16 miles open for the army of Israel to pass on dry land. The soldiers did not approach within 600 paces of the ark.—*Before.* This insinuated that they would pass over in a miraculous manner; though perhaps Josue did not know by what means God would enable them to cross ( C.) the overflowing waters. Josephus only seems to intimate that they abated suddenly, so that they might be forded, &c. He also greatly diminishes or destroys the miracle performed at the passage of the Red Sea. Yet here he acknowledges a sort of “prodigy in the waters being restrained,” and resuming their usual course as soon as the priests had left the channel of the river.—*And take*, &c. Heb. places these words at the beginning of the sentence, after *cubits.* H.  
**5** *Sanctified*, as Moses had required at Mount Sinai, (Ex. 19:10. 15,) ordering the people to wash their garments, and to abstain from their wives, that by this exterior purity, they might be reminded not to neglect that of the soul, without which they would derive but small benefit or instruction from the greatest miracles.  
**6** *Commands.* Josue was only the organ of God, ( C.) whose orders he announces to the sacred ministers; (v. 8. M.) though as a civil magistrate, he was bound to hear and to obey them in matters of religion. C.—When *he* ordered circumcision to be administered, when he blessed the multitude, and ratified the covenant between God and the people, (C. 5 and 24. &c.) he did nothing but what a virtuous governor ought to do; yet he did not these things by virtue of his civil jurisdiction, or in opposition to the spiritual authority of Eleazar. Moses had been the supreme head, being both priest and king. But only *part of his glory* was communicated to Josue, while Eleazar was directed to consult the Lord for him, (Num. 27:21. Theod. q. 48. in Num.) Josue was to govern *at his word*, so that he was bound to consider the high priest as his superior. What he therefore did, was in subordination and conformity to the will of Eleazar and of God, and not designed to shew that the priestly authority belonged to himself, as English Protestants would hence infer. The best of princes, both in the Old and New Testament, have always looked upon it as a part of their duty to promote the true religion. W.—Isaias (49) foretold that kings and queens would esteem it their glory to guard and to advance the prosperity of the Church. H.—Hence they may enact laws for this purpose. S. Aug. c. Crescon. iii. 51. Constantine ratified the judgment passed already by the bishops in the cause of Cecilian, though he confessed at the same time that the determination did not belong to his tribunal; ( W.) and he greatly disapproved of the conduct of the Donatists, who appealed to him, as the heathens might have done to an emperor, who was at the same time one of their high priests. H.—*O rabida furoris audacia*, said he, *sicut in causis gentilium fieri solet, appellationem interposuerunt* *.* 1 Optat. c. Parm. i. S. Aug. ep. 166. Other emperors and kings have acquired great fame, on account of their labours and zeal in defence of the Church. Thus the kings of Spain and of France have obtained the titles of *Catholic* and *Most Christian*, and our Henry VIII. was honoured by Pope Leo X. with the title of *Defender o* *f the Faith*, in 1521, ( W.) on account of the book which he presented to that pontiff, while he was yet an obedient son of the Catholic Church, and undertook to defend her faith on the sacraments, against the objections of Luther. In this the faith which the kings of England defend at present? Whatever the princes might do in the old law in spiritual matters, no inference can be drawn for the same right being now exercised by civil magistrates, how supreme soever in their own sphere. Those princes, Josue, &c. might be considered not only in the light of civil governors, but also in that of *prop* *hets*, who had a great share in the administration of affairs under the Jewish theocracy. If God chose to make known his will by the mouth of a king, or by that of a *shepherd*, his mandates were to be put in execution with equal exactitude. But now the distinctive limits of the ecclesiastical and of the civil power are more clearly ascertained. *Render therefore to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s a* *nd to God the things that are God’s.* Mat. 22:21.) The kingdom of Christ is not of *this world;* neither did he appoint kings to be the *pastors* of his Church. H.  
**7** *Also.* Grotius remarks that God made known his choice of the governors of his people by miracles, till the days of Saul. In effect, we hardly find any, before that time, whose public authority was not sanctioned by some prodigy. C.  
**8** **Ve** **r.** **8** **.** *It.* Heb. “when you shall have come to the brink (or extremity) of the water of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan,” ( H.) which some explain by saying that they were to stop on the eastern bank, as soon as they had wet their feet, (Serarius) while others say they crossed quite over, and stood at the other side. Masius.—But it is more probable, that as soon as they had touched the waters, the priests halted till the bed of the river was presently dried up, and then they placed themselves in the middle of it, close to the raging billows, which, rising up like mountains, were stopped in their career, ( H.) and forced to retire backwards to their source, v. 15. 17. C. 4:9. Bonfrere. A. Lap.—Some translate, “into the division,” instead of *part*, or *extremity.* C.  
**9** *Hither*, probably to the door of the tabernacle, where the assemblies were held.  
**10** *Living God*, in opposition to the idols of the Gentiles, who were dead men, or at least incapable of affording any assistance to their votaries. Josue gives the people two signs of the divine protection, the destruction of the devoted nations, and the miraculous division of the Jordan, or rather the latter prodigy would be an earnest of the former event; and all, both friends and enemies, might be convinced, that the Lord was with his people, and their present leader, as he had been with Moses. No miracle could have been more suitable for the occasion, none more convincing or useful. C.—It would naturally inspire the Israelites with confidence, at the revival of the miracles wrought 40 years before, when their fathers and some of themselves had passed the Red Sea, in a similar manner. At the same time, it would fill the Chanaanites with still greater dismay and teach them that all resistance would prove fruitless. Some have wondered that they did not oppose the passage of the Israelites on this occasion. But it is a greater matter of surprise that they should have ventured on the dangerous expedient of encountering them in war, after what they had seen and heard. It can be attributed to nothing but their infatuation, and that blindness with which God punished them, that they might draw on a more speedy and merited destruction for their crimes. H.—*Destroy.* Heb. “dispossess, *or* drive out before you the Chanaanite,” &c. These seven nations comprised the *ten* which are mentioned, Gen. 15:19. The *Chan* *aanite* occupied the countries chiefly about Tyre, while the *Hethite* dwelt in the southern part of Palestine. The *Hevite* possessed Mount Hermon, Garizim, &c. The *Pherezite* were not perhaps a separate people, but employed in cultivating the country. The Gergesite were fixed to the east of the lake of Genesareth, the *Jebusite* at Jerusalem, and the *Amorrhite* about the Dead Sea. C.—But they were often mixed with one another, so that their limits cannot be ascertained with any degree of precision. H.  
**12** *Prepare.* Heb. “take.” But they must have been selected from the tribes, either to carry twelve stones out of the bed of the Jordan, and to place twelve others in their stead, as monuments of this stupendous miracle; ( C.) or to accompany the priests and the ark, out of respect. Cajetan. M.  
**13** **V** **er.** **13** **.** *Heap.* Heb. “the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off: the waters that come down from above, even they shall stand as upon a heap,” like mountains of ice. The Vulg. informs us what became of the waters ( H.) below this division. Where it took place we do not find recorded, so that we cannot know exactly how large a space would be left dry. Calmet allows, “near six leagues.” v. 4 and 16. But here, supposing that the Jordan was divided over-against Jericho, he says, that “the waters running off into the Dead Sea, would, in all probability, leave not less than two or three thousand paces of the channel dry.”  
**15** *Water.* Thus they manifested the strength of their faith. C.—Immediately the obedient waters divided, and the gravel or sand was left dry. v. 17. H.—*Channel.* The barley harvest was ready about the 30th of April. Lev. 23:10. On other occasions this overflowing of the Jordan is noticed, 1 Par. 12:15. Eccli. 24:36. Doubdan says that when he visited these parts, at the same season of the year, the Jordan was quite full, on account of the melted snow, and ready to leave its banks. It was about a stone throw across, and very rapid. See C. 1:2. The rains which fall in spring, serve to increase the inundation, (Deut, 11:14,) as well as the snow which melts at that time on Libanus, though a great part resists the violent heats. *Mirum dictu*, says Tacitus v. *tantos inter ardores opacum fidumque nivibus* *.* Jer. 18:14 and 49:19.  
**16** *Mountain.* Heb. “heap or bottle.” The billows were forced to roll back almost as far as the lake of Genesareth, where Sarthan stands, about twenty leagues above Jericho.—*Sarthan* *.* Heb. “rose up on a heap, very far from (or to) the city of Adom, that is beside Sarthan.” The situation of Adom can only be ascertained by that of Sarthan, which was near Bethsan, or Scythopolis, (3 K. 4:12,) in the vale of Jezrahel, on the Jordan. Many copies of the Sept. read Cariathiarim, though it was six or seven leagues up the country, west of Jericho. C.—The swelling billows might perhaps be seen from this place. H.—But it could not properly determine how far the waters rolled back. C.—*Failed.* Heb. “and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, (or of Araba, which means a desert, fit only for pasturage) the salt sea, failed were cut off” from the waters above Jericho. The Jordan after running three miles in the lake of Sodom, without mixing its waters, becomes at last reluctantly confounded with it. *Velut invitus … postremo ebibitur, aquas* *que laudatas perdit, pestilentibus mixtus* *.* Plin. v. 15.  
**17** *Jericho*, at Bethabara, which was five or six leagues from the Dead Sea, all which space was left dry. Jericho was three leagues from the Jordan. C.—*Girded.* Sept. “ready,” preparing the way for all the army. Heb. “firm,” and undaunted. H.—A great part of the day must have been spent in crossing the river, and erecting the two monuments. M.

## Chapter 4

**1** *Over.* Heb. and Sept. “clean, *or* entirely;” perhaps two million people, with all their possessions, had crossed the river on that day, the 10th of Nisan, leaving many of their brethren to cultivate and defend the eastern parts of the Jordan. H.  
**2** *Choose.* Heb. “take,” as C. 3:12. Those twelve men were ordered to attend the ark, and to observe the miracle with care: these are chosen to carry the stones for the monuments. Salien.—Calmet supposes that they are the same people, and that the former verse might be translated, “the Lord had said.” But this does not agree with the context. Heb. “and it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over the Jordan, that the Lord spake.” The former injunction was given before they entered the river. Heb. “the ark passeth … Now therefore take,” &c. H.—One was selected from the tribe of Levi, and one from that of Joseph, so that all the twelve tribes were represented. M.  
**3** *Hard.* The Heb. term is referred by some to the *priests*, “from the station of the priests, prepared, *or* standing firm,” (C. 3:17,) by others to *the stones*, which were to be prepared, hard, or exactly twelve. C.—The Sept. have take it in the latter sense, “twelve stones ready,” or such as they might easily find, in the place where the priests had stood. They were of a flinty nature, ( H.) that they might perpetuate the memory of this event. M.  
**5** *Of Israel*, who had twelve *sons.* The same expression occurs Deut. 32:8, and must be explained of the immediate sons of Jacob, without including those grandchildren who might be born before his death. H.  
**9** *Day.* Some hence infer that Josue did not write this book. But surely if he wrote it towards the end of his life, he might well use this expression, ( M.) as S. Matthew does to denote a shorter term. The twelve stones at Galgal, and in the bed of the Jordan, at Bethabara, ( H.) were probably each placed apart. See Ex. 24:4. M.—They were still to be seen in the days of S. Jerom. Such monuments were formerly very common, and very useful, to make a lasting impression upon the minds of a gross people. See Gen. 28:18. Lev. 26:1.  
**10** *To him.* Moses had been dead forty days. But it seems this miraculous division of the Jordan had been revealed to him, and he had cautioned Josue to let slip no opportunity of attaching the people to God’s service, by erecting monuments of religion, as he did on this occasion. C.—*Haste.* Though they were assured by the divine promise, they experienced a certain fear. Salien.—Even the most constant are liable to such impressions. Mat. 14:30.  
**11** **V** **er.** **11** **.** *People*, who passed over 2000 cubits lower down, and always kept the same distance, till they arrived at Galgal. C.  
**12** *Them.* C. 1:14. Num. 32:28. Forty thousand were only chosen. H.  
**13** *Bands.* Heb. “prepared for war passed over, before the Lord, unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.” H.—These formed the van-guard.—*Plains.* Hebrew harboth, which is translated *desert.* Jer. 52:8. A large plain, fit for pasturage, extended from the city to the Jordan, on the east side. C.  
**14** *In*, &c. Josue recapitulates how this miracle established his authority, and how he was ordered to command the priests to come up from the midst of the Jordan, after the people had all got to the other side, and the stones were fixed, to denote where the ark had stood, like a wall, to hinder the waters from rushing down. H.  
**19** *Month* of the ecclesiastical year. They had left Egypt on the 15th of Nisan, so that they had spent forty years, within five days, on their journey. C.  
**20** *Galgal* *.* It received its name afterwards, C. 5:9. It lay in a direct line from Jericho to the Jordan eastwards, being ten stadia from the former, and fifty from the latter place. Josue had his camp here while he subdued the kings of Chanaan, ( C.) as it had plenty of water and wood in its environs; ( M.) though perhaps at this time, there were no houses. Saul was here recognized king of all Israel, 1 K. 11:14. Tertullian (c. Marc. iv.) supposes that the twelve stones were placed on the ark, *in arcam*, which is not at all probable. C.—But they might be erected in its vicinity, and that may perhaps be the meaning of the author. H.—R. Levi says the stones were placed near the ark, that all Israel might see them thrice a year. Josephus believes that an altar was formed of them.  
**25** *Earth*, particularly of Chanaan. This miracle tends to inspire the enemy with fear and consternation, and to confirm the faith and hope of the Israelites. The obstinacy of the former was thus rendered more inexcusable. C.

## Chapter 5

**1** *Chanaan.* These occupied the countries situated on the Mediterranean sea, as far as Egypt: the *Amorrhites* dwelt nearer to the lake of Sodom. The whole country is divided between these two nations, including that territory which the Philistines had seized, and which belonged also to Israel. Almost every city had its respective king, according to the ancient custom in the east, *intra* *suam cuique patriam regna finiebantur* *.* Justin. i. Strabo (xvi.) says this was particularly verified in the cities of Phœnicia. C.—*Till they.* Heb. “we … their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.” They fainted as it were through fear, and could not take their breath, or according to the Sept. adopt any thing rational; “they had no prudence,” *ph* *ronesis* *.* H.  
**2** *Time.* While the enemy was rendered incapable of attacking the Israelites by excessive fear ( C.) and consternation, Josue was commanded to renew the sign of the covenant, by which they were to take possession of the land, and it is supposed that he complied the day after he arrived at Galgal; ( H.) so that the wound would be healing, when the feast of the Passover commenced four days later. On the third day it is most painful. Gen. 34:25.—*Of stone.* Heb. tsurim, which some translate, “sharp;” but the Sept. and the best interpreters agree, that the word indicates a stone. Such a knife was used by Sephora. Ex. 4:25. It was supposed that sharp stones would cause less inflammation or danger. *Samia testa … amputabant, nec aliter citra perniciem* *.* Plin. xxv. 12. Herodotus (ii. 86,) observes, that the Egyptian embalmers opened the body of the deceased with a “sharp Ethiopian stone.” The people of Africa, and of America, have frequently used stone to cut wood, &c. Some of the Fathers assert, that Christ was circumcised with a knife of stone. But any other sharp instrument might be used for the purpose. Any person might perform the operation. Izates, king of the Adiabenians, received circumcision from the hand of a surgeon. Joseph. xx. 2. C.—*Time.* Not that such as had been circumcised before were to be circumcised again: but that they were not to renew, and take up again the practice of circumcision; which had been omitted during their 40 years’ sojourning in the wilderness; by reason of their being always uncertain whey they should be obliged to march. Ch.—S. Augustine (q. 6,) seems to think that the Israelites despised this ceremony in the desert. Theodoret (q. 2,) supposes it was disused because it was not then necessary, to distinguish the Israelites from other nations. Masius is of opinion that God would not allow them to employ it, after their revolt at Cades-barne, when they would not take possession of the land of Chanaan; and hence they could not resume that privilege, till God had authorized them again, ver 7. Num. 14:33. The covenant with God, of which circumcision was the seal, had been, in the mean time, suspended. But as the Israelites are no where blamed, in Scripture, on account of this omission, it seems that God dispensed with them during the 38 years after they left Sinai, that the children might not be exposed to the evident danger of perishing, as the people knew not how soon the cloud would give notice for an immediate departure. C.—Since they were now in te midst of the nations of Chanaan, this distinctive mark ( M.) was to be henceforth diligently observed. H.  
**3** *Hill*, at Galgal. Josue took care to have this ceremony performed. C.—Perhaps he circumcised some himself, as Abraham did those of his own *house.* Gen. 17:23. M.  
**4** *Second.* Heb. “this is the thing, (the cause why) Josue gave circumcision.”  
**5** *Desert.* After the departure from Sinai, where the Passover was celebrated, and where, of course, the people must have been circumcised. C.  
**6** *Forty.* Some copies of the Sept. add, “two,” as if the 40 years’ wandering in the desert, were to be dated from the time that the spies discouraged the people, in the second year of their departure from Egypt. But the Heb. and the best chronologers allow only 40 years in the whole. C.—Heb. “For the children of Israel walked 40 years in the wilderness, till all the men fit for war, who came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord, unto whom the Lord swore that he would not shew them the land, which the Lord swore unto their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey; (7) and their children he raised up in their stead, them Josue circumcised.” H.—The Sept. is also rather fuller than the Vulg. but gives the same sense. These children who receive, what their rebellious fathers had been refused, are a sensible figure of the Christian Church; as that *second circumcision* under Josue, represents the spiritual cleansing of the heart, which Jesus Christ has enjoined. Rom. 2:28. 1 Cor. 7:19.  
**8** *Healed.* The Passover lasted eight days: after which they proceeded to attack Jericho. Yet the people, unfit for war, remained at Galgal; where the camp continued a long time afterwards.  
**9** *Egypt.* The people of that country adopted circumcision only after this period, ( C.) and it never became general among them. They were therefore held in abhorrence, like the rest of the uncircumcised nations, among the Jews. Gen. 34:14. 1 K. 14:6. Theodoret (q. 4,) looks upon circumcision as a symbol of the liberation from the servitude of Egypt, where, he says, history informs us, that many of the Hebrews had neglected this rite.—*Galgal* is interpreted liberty, by Josephus; but moderns render it “a rolling away,” ( C.) or revolution. Heb. “I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you.” H.—Those Israelites who remained at the other side of the river, were ordered to be circumcised at the same time with their brethren. But they could not partake in the solemnity of the Passover, as they were at a distance from the ark. Salien.  
**10** *Phase.* This was the third. The first was celebrated in Egypt. Ex. 12. The second at Sinai. Num. 9. M.—Afterwards it was disused till the Israelites took possession of Chanaan, as it was chiefly designed for that country. Ex. 12:25.  
**11** *Corn.* Some pretend that the Heb. means “old corn.” But the ancient interpreters take no notice of this restriction. The offering of corn was probably omitted on this occasion, as the Israelites had not cultivated the land.—*Frumenty.* Sept. “new corn.” Heb. “parched, on that same day.” These last words are taken by the Sept. as a part of the next sentence.  
**12** *Land.* The Sept. intimate on the 15th. The Heb. seems to say the 16th, Nisan, “on the morrow after they had eaten of the (old) corn.” C.—Grabe’s Septuagint agrees with the Vulgate and Heb. and specifies that the Israelites “eat of the corn of the country on the day after the Passover, unleavened and new. On that day, the morrow, manna ceased.” All depends on the determination of the first day of the festival. If we date from the eating of the paschal lamb on the 14th, or from the solemn day, which was the 15th, manna must have been withdrawn either on the 15th or 16th of the month; though Salien thinks that it ceased as soon as the Israelites had begun to eat of the fruit of the country, on the eastern side of the Jordan. This miraculous food was withholden as soon as the Israelites entered the land of promise; and so the blessed Eucharist, of which it was a figure, and all the sacraments, will cease, when the Christian people shall have taken possession of their heavenly country. H.  
**13** *Adversaries?* Dost thou bear arms for or against us? C.  
**14** *Prince of the host of the Lord*, &c. S. Michael, who is called prince of the people of Israel. Daniel 10:21. Ch.—Some of the Fathers explain it of the son of God. Orig. hom. 6. But S. Aug. C. D. xi. 13. S. Jerom in Gal. iii. and interpreters in general agree, that the person who here appeared to Josue, was the archangel Michael. He came, in the name of God, to assure Josue of success, as the angel had appeared to Moses in the *burning* bush, as if to denote the distress of the Hebrews, and to encourage Moses to undertake their liberation. C.—Chal. “I am the angel sent by God.” In that character he is called *the Lord.* H.  
**15** *Worshipping.* Not with divine honour, but with a religious veneration of an inferior kind, suitable to the dignity of his person. Ch.—He styles the angel Adonai, which is a title frequently given to men; and hence he does not seem to have designed to give him supreme worship. C.—If he did, ( H.) it was referred to God. C. See Ex. 20.  
**16** **Ver** **.** **16** **.** *Loose.* The angel did not only accept of the honour done to him, but also required more, shewing that the field near Jericho was rendered *holy*, by his presence. W.—Hence he ordered Josue to put off his shoes, as Moses had done at the bush. Ex. 3:5. The Turks leave their shoes at the doors of their mosques, and do not dare to tread on the bare floor. Formerly the pagans would not spit in their temples. Arrian. “If, says Porphyrius, in the sacrifices instituted by men, in honour of the gods, people be careful to have their shoes clean, with how much greater attention ought we to preserve our bodies, which are, as it were, the garments of the soul, free from every impurity and corruption!” Abstin. 2. C.

## Chapter 6

**2** *The Lord*, in the person of the angel, who appeared to Josue, as he was praying in silent meditation, or reconnoitring the city of Jericho. C. 5:13. H.—*Men.* People of the different nations had come to defend the city. C. 24:11.  
**3** *Men.* These went first. Afterwards the priests bore the ark, which was followed by all the people. C.—The procession began on a Sunday. Rabbins.  
**4** *Jubilee.* Num. 10:2. The number seven, is often used to express an indefinite number. But here a particular stress is laid upon it. See Masius. As, on the 7th year the Hebrews regained the possessions which they had sold: so now they assert their rights to the land of Chanaan. The sound of the trumpets announced joyful tidings to them. M.  
**5** *Tune*, with certain modulations, continued for a long time. Num. 10:5. H.—*Ground.* The Rabbins say they sink in, so that the ruins might not impede the march of the army. Some think only a large breach was made, opposite to the Israelites, as the house of Rahab upon the walls was preserved. C.  
**7** *He said.* Some MSS. and Heb. editions have, “they said,” though the points shew it must be singular, whatever Michaelis may object in favour of the Masora. Leusen foolishly admits here *a double literal sense.* Ken. H.  
**11** *There.* This singular procession served to exercise the obedience of the people, and to teach them to despise the enemy, who durst not come out to attack them, though many were unarmed. C.  
**15** *Seventh day.* The Jews say it was the sabbath; but of this there is no proof. Marcion hence took occasion to accuse God of inconsistency, as he forbad all working, and yet ordered the people to go round Jericho on a sabbath day. But Tertullian (iv. 12,) answers very well, that servile work is forbidden, and not the works of God or of religion, and God may change the ceremonial law as he thinks proper. C.—*Sabbato opera humana prohibentur non divina* *.* D.  
**16** *Said*, or “had said,” when he gave the people the sound of the trumpet for a sign ( H.) when they were to shout, v. 5. He probably gave the regulations respecting the plunder of the city, before the army left the camp. C.  
**17** *An anathema.* That is, a thing accursed and devoted to utter destruction. Ch.—Only the metal that was found, was consecrated to the Lord, (v. 19,) and the family of Rahab saved. In devoting things, the person who laid on the curse, might extend its operation as he pleased. On some occasions, all was to be destroyed; on others, some things were preserved. Deut. 2:34. Lev. 27:21. C.—This first city, which the Israelites attacked, was treated with peculiar severity, to terrify the rest.  
**18** *Forbidden, transgression, sin.* Heb. has always *anathema.* H.  
**19** *Treasures*, probably in the tabernacle. See Num. 31:48. God claims the first-fruits of the booty, as an acknowledgment that he granted the victory, ( C.) and all the riches of the country, to his people. H.  
**23** *Men.* Heb. “boys;” a name given to people advanced in years.—*Camp.* A respect for the majesty of God, would not permit the Israelites to introduce unbelievers into the camp. They were first instructed, and then the men were circumcised, and the women received baptism. C.  
**25** *Day.* Rahab prefigured the wild olive tree, which S. Paul says was engrafted on the good olive tree, (Rom. 11:24,) and which will remain till the end of the world. Theod. q. 8. She married Salmon, of the tribe of Juda, and became the ancestor of David and of the Messias. C.  
**26** *Cursed*, &c. Jericho, in the mystical sense, signifies *iniquity;* the sounding of the trumpets by the priests, signifies the preaching of the word of God; by which the walls of Jericho are thrown down, when sinners are converted; and a dreadful curse will light on them who build them up again. Ch.—*Gates.* Some copies of the Sept. insert here that the curse fell upon Azan (Hiel) of Bethel, 3 K. 16:34. Before his time, there was a city of palm-trees, or Jericho, built in the neighbourhood. Joseph. Bel. v. 4. Though Hiel was so severely punished, no one made any scruple to live there. Elias and Jesus Christ himself honoured the place with their presence. The city is now almost in ruins, and the territory uncultivated. Ancient history mentions similar imprecations against obnoxious cities. Thus the Romans cursed the rebuilders of Carthage, and Agamemnon followed “the ancient custom,” says Strabo, (xiii.) laying a curse upon those who should rebuild the city of Troy. The Ionians and Greeks forbad those temples to be re-established, which the Persians had destroyed, that they might remain eternal monuments of the impiety of the latter, and of the hatred which subsisted between the two nations. Pausanias in Phoc. C.

## Chapter 7

**1** *Children.* Achan was guilty of theft: some of the rest might have connived at his fault. He had taken what was reserved for the Lord. The offender was discovered, to inspire all with a horror for his conduct. Some of his brethren were punished, (v. 5,) but they suffered for their own secret transgressions, or death might be no real punishment to them; while the Israelites were awakened to a sense of their own inability to conquer without the divine protection, and were forced to humble themselves. H.—Chastisements are the marks of God’s displeasure, though they frequently proceed also from his clemency.—*Achan* is called *Achar*, 1 Par. 2:7. These five persons occupy the space of 265 years; so that they must have been 50 or 55 years old, when they had children.  
**2** *Against H* *ai*, to see the situation and strength of that city, which was about 10 miles west, or rather north, of Jericho. It was afterwards rebuilt, 1 Esd. 2:28.—*Bethaven* and *Bethel* are the same place; (S. Jerom. C.) though many distinguish them, with Cellarius. The former name means “the house of iniquity,” because Jeroboam there set up a golden calf. Bethel was its former appellation, in consequence of the vision of Jacob. Gen. 28.  
**3** *Few.* It appears, however, that the city contained 12,000 fighting men; so that these spies must have formed a false notion of its strength. C. 8:25.  
**5** *Sabarim*, which means people “broken and defeated.” Sept. “they pursued them from the gate, till they had entirely broken them,” destroying 36, and putting the rest to flight. C.—This small disaster filled the whole camp with dismay, as the Lord generally caused the victories of his people to be complete, and without any loss, as long as they continued in his favour. None were found wanting of those who attacked and destroyed so many of the Madianites. Num. 31:49. H.  
**6** *Heads.* These marks of grief were very common. Achilles covered his head with ashes, tore his garments and face, when he received news of the death of his friend, Patroclus. Homer and Virgil, (xii.) speaking of Latinus, the king, says, *It scissa veste Latinus—Canitiem immundo perfusam pulvere turpans* *.*  
**7** *Began.* Some had established themselves in the land of Galaad. M.—Heb. “would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan.” Josue speaks in this animated manner, through zeal for the glory of God, ( C.) more than for any personal inconvenience. He was grieved that any one should have merited God’s displeasure. He was afraid that the Chanaanites would blaspheme the *great name* of the Lord, v. 9.  
**11** *Lied.* Each one, on delivering up what he had taken, made profession, at least by his behaviour, ( H.) that he retained nothing. Achan did like the rest, but he kept back of the plunder. C.—He lied, and did not comply with the promise made by all Israel, which he was bound to observe, as much as if he had made it with his own mouth.  
**13** *Sanctified.* Prepared by washing, &c. to appear before the tabernacle, and see the event. Sept. “purify the people.” Chal. “call an assembly.”  
**14** *Find.* Heb. “it shall be the tribe which the Lord taketh.” H.—This was done by lots, as on similar occasions, 1 K. 10:20 and 14:41. When God authorized this method, there could be no danger in it. But to have recourse to lots without such authority, would be often tempting God. The apostles chose an apostle by lot: but they had first taken every precaution ( C.) to select two persons, both fit for the important charge. H.—To commit the choice of sacred ministers to chance would be extremely improper. “We forbid the use of lots in the elections,” said Honorius. C.  
**18** *Juda.* The dignity of this tribe enhanced the fault of Achan. M.  
**19** *My son.* Clemency is the virtue of great souls.—*Give glory.* Confess candidly. Jo. 9:24.  
**21** *Garment.* Heb. “a robe of Sannaar, *or* of Babylon.” This city was famous for embroidered, or painted robes, such as were worn by kings. Jonas 3:6. Plin. viii. 48.—*Rule*, or linget. No coin was yet used. C.  
**24** *His sons*, &c. Probably conscious to, or accomplices of the crime of their father, ( Ch). as he could hardly have concealed these things in the midst of his tent without their knowledge. M.—But granting, with S. Aug. (q. 8,) that they were innocent of this crime, God, who is the sovereign arbiter of life and death, might order them out of the world, on this occasion, without injustice.  
**25** *Day.* Hence some have drawn a very weak argument, to prove the repentance of Achan, as if he had only to undergo a temporary punishment. It is probable, however, that his sincere confession, proceeding from a penitent heart, might influence God to shew him mercy.—*Fire.* Children, as well as his other effects; though some have supposed that the former were spared, as they are not here specified. Heb. seems to include them; “and burnt them with fire after they had stoned them with stones.” Chaldee says they were stoned first. C.  
**26** *A* *chor.* That is, trouble; ( Ch). in allusion to the name of Achar, as he is called in the Sept. invariably, and in the Heb. and Vulg. in the Book of Chronicles. H.—This *heap of stones* was thrown upon the ashes of the deceased, or perhaps at his person, while he was burning at the stake, as it is the custom still among the Turks. Roger. ii. 7. The king of Hai was treated in this manner. C. 8:29. See 2 K. 18:17. The *vale of Achor* was on the road between Jerusalem and Jericho, where a small castle, at Adommim, was built to protect travellers from the insults of robbers, who infested that part. Lu. 10:30. C. 15:7.

## Chapter 8

**1** *Men.* Masius and Salien ( H.) suppose that Josue selected out of them 30,000; 5000 of whom were to be placed in ambush, and the rest were to pretend that they were terrified at the approach of the king of Hai, and to flee with Josue. But the text seems to assert that all accompanied their general, ( C.) excepting such as were left to guard the camp.  
**2** *King.* There was this difference, that the king of Hai was to be gibbeted, and his corpse stoned, while the city was to be plundered by the Israelites.—*It.* This mode of warfare is equally just, as if the enemy was attacked in the open field. *Dolus an virtus quis in hoste requirat?* Virg.—God was pleased to authorize it on this occasion, that his people might be less exposed, being under some apprehensions on account of the former defeat. Some nations have preferred to encounter the enemy openly. Grot. Jur. iii. 1. 20. But their example is no law for others. “When the war is just, it matters not whether a person gain the victory by open fighting or by stratagem.” S. Aug. q. 10. “It is often prudent to conceal the truth.” c. Mend. x. People engaged in warfare, allow each other to take such advantages. God could easily have routed these few men by means of the army of Israel, or by a miracle, as he did at Jericho. H.—But he is at liberty to act as he thinks proper. The ambush was laid on the south-west side of Hai, so that those of Bethel might not perceive it, as they came out to the assistance of their countrymen, v. 17. Five thousand were placed in one place, and 25,000 in another, while the main body of the army, under Josue, took a circuit by the east, and came to attack the city on the north side. C.  
**4** *Ready* to enter the city, when its soldiers are all in pursuit of us. H.  
**5** *And turn*, &c. Josue had not fled before. C.—Heb. “against us, as at the first, we will flee before them.”  
**8** *Fire.* They were to set some houses on fire for a signal, but the whole city was not to be destroyed ( C.) till the Israelites had collected the plunder. H.  
**10** *Ancients*, who had a command in the army, and assisted Josue with their counsel. They gave him an account of the state and numbers of the army. C.  
**12** *Five thousand.* These were part of the 30,000 mentioned above, v. 3. Ch.—Josue had given orders to have them placed in ambush apart; ( C.) unless, perhaps, he places these himself in some secret place. H.  
**13** *Night.* He spent the forepart of it at Galgal, to prevent any suspicion, v. 9. But setting out very early, (v. 10,) he arrived at Hai before sun-rise.  
**14** *Desert* of Bethel, fit only for pasturage. C. 18:12.  
**15** *Afraid.* Heb. “made as if they were beaten before them, and fled.” Thus they drew on the king of Hai, so as to leave the ambush in his rear. C.  
**17** *Not one* fit to bear arms. W.—*Bethel.* As soon as the people of this city perceived the Israelites fleeing, they rushed out to assist the king of Hai in the pursuit. But when they saw the former rally, before they had joined their friends, ( C.) they very prudently retired, and left the unhappy citizens of Hai to their fate. H.—Hence all who were slain belonged to the latter city, v. 25.  
**18** *Sh* *ield*, as Moses lifted up his hands. Ex. 17:11. Some translate, “dart, spear,” or “sword.” Sept. and Eccli. 16:3. C.—The buckler might be suspended on a spear, ( M.) that it might be seen afar off ( W.) by some appointed to keep watch on purpose. H.  
**23** *Josue.* This king was reserved for greater torments and ignominy. It was the ancient custom to present kings and chief commanders to the victorious general, who rewarded those who brought them. Grotius.  
**28** *For ever*, or for a long time. It was rebuilt before the captivity. 2 Esd. 7:31.  
**29** *Gibbet.* Sept. “a cross.” Some say that the king was first killed; but that assertion is destitute of proof. The corpse was taken down before night. Deut. 21:22.  
**30** *Hebal* *.* The Sam. Chronicle says on Mount Garizim. No doubt Josue complied with the injunctions of Moses: but we have seen that there are reasons to doubt which mountain he pitched upon. Deut. 27:4. H.—It seems more probable that the altar would be upon Garizim, where the blessings were proclaimed, if the texts of Moses and of Josue did not formally assert the contrary. C.—But if they have been interpolated, nothing certain can be deduced from those passages. Josephus (iv. 8,) says that the altar was between the two mountains, not far from Sichem, which was built at the foot of Garizim; and it is not probable that this historian, the mortal enemy of the Samaritans, would have hesitated to assert that the altar was upon Hebal, if the texts had been so positive, in his time. It is undeniable that the tribes of Levi, and of Ephraim, were upon Garizim; and consequently Josue and the *priests* must have been there; and who would then officiate at the altar on Hebal? See Kennicott, who ably refutes the insinuations of the infidel, Collins, against the character of the Samaritans. When this altar was erected the learned are not agreed. H.—Some say, immediately after the passage of the Jordan, and that the 12 stones taken from the bed of the river, were used for that purpose. Josephus says five years elapsed, and R. Ismael supposes that the altar was not built during the 14 years after the passage of the Jordan. But it is most probable that Josue complied with the command of God as soon as he had procured a sort of peace, ( H.) by the conquest of these two cities, and was thus enabled to penetrate into the heart of the country, where Garizim was situated, not in the plain of Jericho, as Eusebius imagined, but near Sichem, ( C.) about 30 or 40 miles to the north-west of Jericho. H.  
**31** *Iron.* Spencer complains that the Prot. have not translated barzel, “iron tool,” as Deut. 27:5. This translation is found in their more ancient editions of 1537–49, &c. Ken.—But the difference is very unimportant. The reason of this prohibition is given, Ex. 20:25.—*He* *offered;* so we read that *he wrote, blessed and cursed*, &c. because these things were done at least by his authority. It is not necessary to suppose that he engraved the words of the law with his own hands, or that he passed from Garizim, where he had been pronouncing the blessings, to Hebal, in order to denounce the curses. H.—He probably commissioned some of the princes on Hebal to perform the office of cursing, after he had repeated the blessings himself from Garizim; and the select company of Levites before the ark, having answered or repeated the words, the whole multitude stationed at the foot of Hebal, giving their consent that the transgressors should be cursed. Ken.—Hence Josue must have sacrificed by the hands of the priests. H.—Various instances are produced to show that princes and prophets have, on extraordinary occasions, performed this office themselves, 1 K. 6:15 and 7:9. 3 K. 18:32. C.—But these must have either received a dispensation from God, or they must have employed the ministry of the legal priests; or, in fine, their actions, like that of Saul, (1 K. 13:9,) of Absalom, (ib. 1:9,) Herod, &c. may have been deserving of blame. H.—The Jews assert that in the desert no one was permitted to sacrifice, except in the tabernacle; but that this prohibition ceased at Galgal, as the ark had no fixed abode, and thus Josue might offer sacrifice himself. Afterwards the law was enforced, while the ark was at Silo. But upon its being removed to Nobe, Maspha, and Gabaon, people resumed their former liberty; and hence there was nothing to hinder Samuel, Saul, and David from offering sacrifice, till the temple was erected. Outram de Sac. i. 2. Grot. in Deut. xii. 8. This sacred office was formerly exercised by kings, particularly at Athens, where, after the people became more numerous, Theseus appointed *the king of sacrifices* to keep up the memory of the ancient practice. Demost. c. Neream. C. The like was done at Rome under the republic. H.  
**32** *Stones*, of which the altar was formed, ( C.) or on a separate monument, (Masius) consisting of two stones of black marble, so as to leave the letters prominent, and to fill up the vacuities with white plaster, that they might be seen more plainly, and might, at the same time, be more durable than if they had been only written on the cement, whatever some may have said of the tenacity of the ancient plaster.—*Deuteronomy*, &c. or copy of the Decalogue which, by way of eminence, is called *the law.* Act. 7:53. It is distinguished from the blessings and the curses; (v. 34,) and Moses referred to it, as already existing, (Deut. 27:3. 8,) though the Book of Deuteronomy was not finished till afterwards. He might point to the very tables contained in the ark. “This law, consisting of only 16 verses, might easily be engraved on this solemn day; whereas to engrave the 80 verses of blessings and cursings, would be improbable; and engraving the Pentateuch, or indeed the Book of Deuteronomy, had been impossible.” That the Decalogue was to be thus solemnly proclaimed is evident, from the Sam. text. Ex. 20:18. Kennicott.—This was the covenant which God had made with his people, (Deut. 4:13,) and which Moses cautions the Israelites to observe; as upon their fidelity, their present and future happiness entirely depended. It was on this title alone that they could hold the land of Chanaan; and therefore Josue takes care thus publicly to admonish them of their duty. H.—The Rabbins say that the whole Pentateuch was written on this occasion in 70 languages, that no nation might plead ignorance. But we can hardly believe that even the Book of Deuteronomy could be written, and read, and explained to the people, as that would require many days. C.  
**33** *Hebal* *.* “Gerizim and Ebal, says Maundrell, p. 59, are separated by a narrow valley, not above a furlong broad; and Naplosa, (the ancient Sychem) consisting chiefly of two streets lying parallel, is built at the foot of, and under Gerizim.” The princes, representing the different tribes, were stationed on these mountains, and the crowd at the foot of them, while a select company of Levites attended the ark in the midst, and repeated what the princes proclaimed, that the multitude might answer *Amen*, as they turned successively to them; (Kennicott) or the princes might answer *Amen*, from the top of the two hills. C.—*And first.* Prot. “as Moses … had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.” But if Josue blessed them himself, ( H.) all superiors might do so, as parents bless their children. W.  
**34** *Words.* Heb. “words of the law, the blessings,” &c. H.  
**35** *Repeated.* Coverdale’s Bible has “Josua caused it to be proclaimed.” “It is very common in Scripture to represent a person as doing that which is done by another, in his name and by his authority.” Kennicott.—Josue might be in the midst to preside, ( C.) or rather he would be along with the princes of the six tribes on Mount Garizim, v. 30. H.—Thus the covenant entered into between God and the Israelites, was solemnly ratified when the latter first entered the promised land. The greatest part of those who had been present at Horeb had perished in the wilderness. C.

## Chapter 9

**1** *These things.* The solemn covenant by which the Israelites took possession of Chanaan, ( H.) and the destruction of two cities of Jericho and Hai. C.—The kings on that *side of the Jordan*, and in all the neighbourhood, perceiving that, if the Israelites were suffered to attack them singly, in this manner, they would all presently lose their dominions and their lives. They resolved, therefore, to form a general league, offensive and defensive. H.—*Beyond.* Heb. “on the side of.”—*Mountains*, on the south of Judea.—*Sea.* All the nations of Phoenicia, and the country of the Philistines, ( C.) who had seized a part of the country, which belonged to the Israelites. Josue divided their territory among the people, though he did not live to make the conquest of it. H.—*Libanus* *.* Heb. “and in all the coasts of the great sea, over-against Libanus,” as if the Phœnicians were alone meant. C.  
**4** *Provisions.* By the alteration of a single letter, Heb. means, “they feigned themselves to be ambassadors.” But the Chal. Syr. and Sept. agree with the Vulgate. C.—The Gabaonites were Hevites, though they are called by the more general name of Amhorrites, 2 K. 21:2. S. Jerom says that their city stood in the tribe of Benjamin; according to Josephus, 40 or 50 stadia north of Jerusalem. M.—They alone had the prudence to submit, ( C.) being terrified and converted by the miracles of God. H.—*Aga* *in.* In the East, goat skins with the hair inwards, are used to carry wine.  
**5** *Patches.* Heb. “spotted,” or of different colours, like shoes worn out and spoiled with dirt.—*Pieces.* Heb, is translated, “dry, burnt, eaten, mouldy,” &c. But it means fine thin bread, or wafers, (3 K. 14:3,) full of holes. The Israelites partook of this bread, which they would hardly have done if it had been mouldy. C.  
**7** *You.* The Gabaonites addressed themselves to the first whom they met in the camp; and these made this remark to them before they were brought into the presence of Josue. The Israelites could make no league with the Chanaanites, as with equals, but only on condition that the latter should embrace the true religion, and acknowledge the dominion of the former. Grot. Ex. 23:32. Deut. 7:2.  
**8** **V** **er.** **8** **.** *Servants.* They did not mean to submit to servitude, but to make a league; otherwise they would not have needed to have recourse to such artifices. C.—But finding that no other terms could be procured, they were willing, at any rate, to save their lives. H.  
**9** *God.* So the queen Saba came to Solomon, 3 K. 10. The people of Gabaon being convinced that the God of Israel was the only true God, came to join themselves to his people, and to worship him. Serarius.  
**10** *Astaroth* *.* They take care not to mention what had happened so recently at Jericho, lest they might be detected. C.  
**13** *And almost.* This is added by way of farther explanation of the Heb. “are become old.” H.  
**14** *Victuals*, to examine whether they were as old as they pretended; or they eat of them in sign of friendship. M.—Thus we find a feast generally accompanied the making of a league. Gen. 26:30 and 31:54. To betray a guest was deemed a heinous injury. Ps. 54:15. Euripides.—*Lord.* By the high priest, clothed with the Urim and Thummim. C.—This remark shews that the Israelites had been guilty of some negligence. H.—Hence they were so easily deceived, being perhaps overjoyed that their friendship should be courted by so distant a nation. M.—The high priest was ordered to consult the Lord for Josue, at the door of the tabernacle. Ex. 29:42. Num. 27:21. W.  
**15** *Them.* Were they bound to keep this promise? Some maintain the negative, as it was obtained by fraud, and therefore the Gabaonites leave themselves to the mercy of Josue, (v. 25,) who condemns them to perpetual servitude in the house of the Lord. He could not, however, have taken away their lives after what had passed. The error was not essential, but the people might have obtained the same conditions, if they had frankly told the truth. If we make a contract with a person who pretends to be of a nation to which he does not belong, the contract will hold good. The deceit of the Gabaonites was punished as it deserved. But God required that the conditions which were granted to them, should be diligently observed; and the family of Saul was severely punished, because he had slain some of them. 3 K. 21. If the rest of the Chanaanites had changed their religion, and submitted to the Israelites, they might have been preserved, as Rahab, and so many others were, with whom the pious kings scrupled not to form alliances. C. 11:19. Deut. 20:10, &c. Masius. Bonfrere. C.—They were, however, obliged to yield possession of the land to the Israelites, and to renounce idolatry. The Gabaonites were willing to accede to these conditions, and therefore Josue might justly make a peace with them. M.  
**16** *Now.* The five kings coming to attack the Gabaonites, these were forced to confess the truth, and to implore the assistance of the Israelites; ( C.) or perhaps Rahab had given information who they really were. M.—Josue flew to their assistance in the night, and arrived the day following. C. 10:9.  
**18** *Israel.* This is one reason why their lives were spared. But we have seen that they could not, with justice, have treated them as enemies, on their submitting to the conditions required, even if they had not engaged themselves by oath. The Gabaonites knew with what respect oaths were then kept by the Hebrews, even when they might have some specious pretext for dispensing themselves from their obligation. “People had not yet begun to neglect God, as they do in the present age; nor did they allow themselves the liberty of interpreting an oath, and accommodating the laws to their own humour, but they rather regulated their morals by their prescription.” *Nondum hæc quæ nunc tenet sæculum, negligentia Dei venerat*, &c. Livy iii.  
**21** *Multitude.* The common people, only considering their own private advantage, murmured at the conduct of their leaders, as they supposed that they were thus deprived of the plunder ( C.) of many cities, and engaged in a dangerous war, with the five confederate kings. But this war was in no degree detrimental to them, as they knew they had to subdue the whole country; and as for the Gabaonites, they eased the people of Israel of a great burden, by doing the drudgery of the tabernacle, which otherwise must have fallen upon them. H.—These people were dispersed through the country, particularly in the cities of the priests and Levites, whose servants they were forced to be. Gabaon was allotted to the priests. In latter ages, many of these poor people being slain by Saul, &c. David was obliged to select some others, called *Nathineans*, or “people given,” to supply their place, ( C.) unless these were all the remnants of the Gabaonites. M.—Josephus (Bel. ii. 17,) speaks of the feast of *Xylophoria*, or “wood carrying,” for the uses of the temple; and we read, (2 Esd. 10:34,) that lots were cast *among the priests and the Levites, and the people, for the offering of wood*, &c. which seems to insinuate that the ancient institution was then altered. Many authors speak of a fountain which furnished the temple with water, after the captivity, so that the service of the Gabaonites was not much wanted. We find no mention of them after that time.  
**23** *Curse.* Heb. “you are cursed, and there shall be none of you freed from being bondmen;” ( H.) you are a part of those nations which are under an anathema, and you deserve to be severely punished. C.—But we shall fulfil our engagements with you, only in punishment for your craftiness: ( H.) you must submit to change your religion, ( C.) which will be your greatest blessing, ( H.) and to perform the meanest offices, which may be considered as a sort of curse. It is thought that some recompense was allowed the Gabaonites for their labour. Serarius, q. 17.—This sentence was probably pronounced at Galgal, ( C.) though we might as well conclude that Josue would wait till he came to Gabaon, before he arraigned the people, as no doubt they would make the best of their way out of the camp, as soon as they had obtained their request. H.—*Water.* Slaves of the meanest condition were employed in these offices. Deut. 29:11. Athen. x. 22.  
**24** *Thereof.* It seems they know not that any conditions would be admitted; and many interpreters have supposed, that none could be offered by the Israelites. See Deut. 20:15.  
**25** *Thee.* They acknowledge not only that Josue is too strong for them, but also that he has a right to punish them for their deceit. They accept, therefore, of whatever terms he is pleased to allow them. C.  
**27** *Chosen* in the tabernacle and temple. M.—In these Gabaonites, of the race of Chanaan, the prediction of Noe, that he should *serve* Sem, was fulfilled. Gen. 9. W.

## Chapter 10

**1** *Adonisedec* means, “Lord of justice,” as Melchisedec denotes “the king of justice;” perhaps Salem was originally styled *Zedec.* Masius.—This king had probably some control over the neighbouring cities. M.—He was also in the greatest danger; and not daring to attack the Israelites, he resolves to fall upon the Gabaonites unawares, that other cities might be deterred from following their example.—*Confederates.* Heb. “and were among them,” which may signify either that the Israelites were to dwell in the towns belonging to the Gabaonites, or that the latter should live along with them, as one and the same people, following the same religion, and bound together by the same interests.  
**2** *Cities.* Yet we read not of its king. C. 9:11. C.—Sept. “It was like a royal metropolis.” H.—*Valiant.* Prudence therefore, and not fear, had influenced them to take this step.  
**3** *Hebron* was about 24 miles south of Jerusalem, and *Jerimoth* 16. *Lachis* was a very famous city, (4 K. 14 and 18:14,) about nine miles south of Eleutheropolis, which was itself situated about 20,000 paces towards the south of Jerusalem; (Itin. Anton.) though some assert it was 22 or 32 miles distant. Eusebius and S. Jerom generally fix the situation of places by this city. *Eglon* was twelve miles to the eastward of it. The Sept. read *Odollam*, ( C.) which was either the same city, (Euseb.) or one probably near it. C. 12:12. 5 and v. 35. 9.  
**5** *Amorrhites* is a generical term, as well as Chanaanite, to denote the people of the country. The other kings did not come to the assistance ( C.) of these five, v. 40. H.—Yet the people of Gabaon might suspect the worst, or exaggerate, in order to make Josue come with greater expedition. He was then at Galgal, above twenty miles distant, and set off the next night, coming unexpectedly upon the confederate kings early in the morning, v. 9.  
**10** *Troubled them.* Sept. “filled them with consternation;” so that they knew not what to do. Ex. 23:17.—*Bethoron* *.* There were two cities of this name in the tribe of Ephraim, rebuilt by *Sara.* 1 Par. 7:24. The *lower* was twelve miles from Jerusalem. *Maceda* was eight from Eleutheropolis to the east, as *Azeca* was about the same distance west of Jerusalem, and not far from Soco. 1 K. 17:1. Thus Josue proceeded westward to Gabaon and Bethoron, where he defeated the confederates, and pursued them, as they fled to their respective cities in the south, on the road between Jerusalem and the country of the Philistines, as far as Maceda. H.  
**11** *Azeca*, for the space of twelve miles.—*Hailstones*, of an uncommon size, accompanied with thunder and lightning. Hab. 3:11. Joseph. v. 1. C. Eccli. 46:6.—Of the same nature was the seventh plague of Egypt. Ex. 9:23. M.—Real stones may very probably have been hurled against the enemy, by means of some hurricane or vulcano, which God directed against the Chanaanites. Several instances of showers of stones are recorded in history. C. Dissert.—Even quantities of stone and earth, sufficient to form new islands, have been thus thrown up. Montfaucon.—The isle of Santorin, in the Archipelago, appeared in 1707.  
**12** *Them.* This may be considered as a canticle of victory, containing a fervent prayer, which was presently followed with the desired effect.—*Aialon.* Heb. “Sun, in Gabaon, be silent; (moved not) and thou, moon, in the valley of Aialon,” or “of the wood,” which was probably not far from Gabaon. Josue had pursued the enemy at mid-day, to the west of that city, when turning round, he addressed this wonderful command to the sun. It is supposed that the moon appeared at the same time. But the meaning may only be, that the sun and the course of the stars should be interrupted for a time. C.—*The sun and the moon stood still in their habitation.* Heb. 3:11. M.—Many have called in question this miracle, with Maimonides, or have devised various means to explain it away, by having recourse to a parhelion or reflection of the sun by a cloud, or to a light which was reverberated by the mountains, after the sun was set, &c. Prœdam iv. 6. Spinosa, Grotius, Le Clerc.—But if these authors believe the Scriptures, they may spare themselves the trouble of devising such improbable explanations, as this fact is constantly represented as a most striking miracle. If S. Paul (Heb. 11:30,) make no mention of it, he did not engage to specify every miracle that had occurred. He does not so much as mention Josue, nor the passage of the Jordan, &c. so that it is a matter of surprise that Grotius should adduce this negative argument, to disprove the reality of the miracle. C.—The pretended impossibility of it, or the inconvenience arising to the fatigued soldiers from the long continuance of the day, will make but small impression upon those who consider, that God was the chief agent; and that he who made all out of nothing, might easily stop the whole machinery of the world for a time, and afterwards put it in motion again, without causing any derangement in the different parts. C.—It is not material whether the sun turn round the earth, or the contrary. H.—The Hebrews generally supposed that the earth was immovable; and on this idea Josue addresses the sun. Philosophers have devised various intricate systems: but the Scripture is expressed in words suitable to the conceptions of the people. The exterior effect would be the same, whether the sun or the earth stood still. Pagan authors have not mentioned this miracle, because none of the works of that age have come down to us. We find, however, that they acknowledged a power in magic capable of effecting such a change.  
**13** *Th* *e book of the just.* In Heb. Sepher hayashar*;* an ancient book long since lost. Ch.—It was probably of the same nature with that of the *wars of the Lord*, (Num. 21:4,) containing an account of the most memorable occurrences which concerned the people of Israel, *the just*, or Ischuron. Deut. 33:5. Josephus (v. 2,) says, such “records were kept in the archives of the temple.” They were drawn up by people of character. The quotations inserted are in a poetical style, as the book might contain various canticles, though the rest was written in prose. See 2 K. 1:18. It might appear unnecessary for Josue to appeal to this work, as the fact in question was known to all. C.—But too great precaution could not be taken to prevent the danger of people calling in question the reality of the miracle. If the book of the just was a more detailed history of facts, out of which this work of Josue has been compiled, as Theodoret supposes, the author might very well remit the more inquisitive reader to that authentic source. H.—*Midst.* It was then almost noon. C.—Josue was nevertheless afraid lest the day should not allow them time to destroy their fleeing enemies completely. H.—If the evening had been at hand, he would have said, *return sun* towards Gabaon, as it would have been on the west of his army. The battle had begun early in the morning, and the pursuit had lasted perhaps four or five hours. C.—*Day.* Heb. “about a whole day.” Many think that a day here comprises 24 hours; and as the sun had been above the horizon six hours, and continued other six, it must have been visible for the space of 36 hours, as the Jews believe, and as it is specified in S. Justin. Dial. The author of Eccli. 46:5, says, *Was not the sun stopped in his anger, and one day made as two?* that is, 24 hour long, allowing 12 unequal ones to form a day, according to the reckoning of those times. Others suppose that the day of Josue might consist of 18 ( C.) or of 48 hours. But how would the soldiers be able to support such a fatigue? They had been marching all the preceding night from Galgal. H.—If they had stopped to take refreshment, their enemies would have escaped. Hence some of the Fathers imagine, that God enabled his people to pursue them without taking any food. S. Jer. c. Jov. ii. They might, however, take some along with them, as it was then customary; and eat as they pursued, whenever they could find an opportunity. Josue had given no prohibition; and Jonathan observed that his father, Saul, had troubled Israel, by following a different plan. 1 K. 14:24. C.  
**14** *Long.* This word is not found in Heb. “and there was no day like that, before it, or after it, that the Lord hearkened unto,” &c. But God had often wrought miracles before, at the prayer of his servants. The difference between this day and all others, must be therefore in the length, or in the stopping of the heavenly bodies. H.—The long day which the prayer of Ezechias procured, (4 K. 20 and Isai. 38) consisted of 32 hours; or, supposing that the retrograde motion of the sun was instantaneous on the dial, it might only be 22 hours in length. C.—But if the day of Ezechias had been even longer, the words of this text may be verified, that neither in times past, nor while the author lived, had any such day been known. See Amama, p. 383. H.—*Obeying.* God is ready to grant the requests of his servants. Isai. 58:9. “We remark something still stronger, in the power which he has given to priests, to consecrate the body and blood of Jesus Christ in the sacrament of the eucharist.” C.  
**15** *Galgal.* Masius supposes, that here the quotation from the book of the just terminates. The Roman and Alex. Sept. place this verse at the end of the chapter. C.—Grabe has it in both places with a star, to shew that it is taken from Theodotion. H.—In effect, Josue did not return to his camp till he had completed the business of the day, by destroying the five kings. After which, he proceeded to conquer that part of the country. He might have designed to return, ( C.) and even have begun his march, ( D.) when he was diverted from proceeding, by the news that the kings had been discovered. So we often say, that a person does what he is on the point of doing. See Gen. 37:21. Num. 34:25.  
**17** *City*, or territory. C.—The kings had sought their own safety in flight, leaving their people to make their escape as well as they could. But their cowardly behaviour only brought upon them a more dishonourable death. Josue and some of the forces stopped in the environs of Maceda, while the rest pursued after the fugitives, and slew all that had not strength to enter the fenced cities. H.—Then all the army assembled round their leader, took Maceda, and completed the victory of that most memorable day, by the ignominious death of the five kings. C.—God permitted some to escape, lest the land should be overrun with wild beasts; (Ex. 23:29,) and to instruct us that his children must suffer tribulation, to prevent the growth of vice. W.  
**21** *No man*, (*nullus* *.*) some supply *canis*, “dog,” alluding to the proverbial expression. Ex. 11:7. Masius, &c.—Sept. “not one of the Israelites moved his tongue.” C.—All was profound silence, in expectation of what would be determined respecting the unfortunate kings. H.  
**24** *Feet*, as Moses had foretold. Deut. 33:29. The conduct of Josue would appear cruel, if we did not reflect that he was only the executioner of the divine justice, which was pleased thus to punish these proud and impious princes, that others might not imitate their example.  
**27** *Down.* Deut. 21. The victorious army had returned some time before the evening, and had time to take the city of Maceda; though some, without reason, believe that this took place the day following.  
**28** *Remains* of inhabitants. C.—The *king* was gibbeted and stoned. H.  
**30** *Lebna*, not far from Eleutheropolis. From before this city Sennacherib dispatched his menacing order to Ezechias, 4 K. 19:8. C.  
**32** *Lachis* was still farther south. Josue took it the second day of the siege.  
**33** *Gazer*, near Azotus, in the country of the Philistines. It is not said that Josue took this city. It was given long after to Solomon by the king of Egypt, 3 K. 9:15. Josue 16:10. C.  
**37** *The king*, viz. the new king, who succeeded him that was slain, v. 26. Ch.—Caleb afterwards took Hebron, which, it seems, the Chanaanites had seized again and fortified, while Josue was conquering other parts of the country. He could not leave garrisons in all the cities which he took, and hence he set many of them on fire. After the strength of the country was broken, he knew that the Israelites might easily subdue the few isolated cities which he was forced to leave behind. But they proved so negligent, that many places were left in the possession of the Chanaanites, which proved a stumbling block to God’s people.  
**38** *Dabir*, which was formerly called Cariath sepher, “the city of the book,” (C. 15:15,) or of *Senna*, (ib. 45,) near Hebron. It was taken again by Othoniel and Caleb.  
**40** *Hills* of Judea.—*South* of the promised land.—*Plain.* Heb. Sephela, a flat country near Eleutheropolis. S. Jer. in Abd. i. 19. 1 Mac. xii. 38.—*Asedoth*, “of the springs.”—*Remains.* God ordered these people to be utterly destroyed, in punishment of their manifold abominations; and that they might not draw the Israelites into the like sins. Ch.  
**41** *Gaza.* These cities were on the southern limits of the land of Chanaan, and of the Philistines.—*Gosen*, or Gessen, where the Hebrews had formerly dwelt. It was then very fertile. C. 13:3. The territory of Juda extended as far as the Nile; ( C.) or this country may have resembled the country of Gessen. Gen. 46. M.—It seems indeed rather wonderful, that if this was a part of the promised land, God should order his people to leave it, as it were, to the Egyptians; and father they had occupied another part of the country, should seize it again. But he might have secret reasons for this order. H.

## Chapter 11

**1** *Jabin*, “the intelligent,” was perhaps the common name of the kings of *Asor*, the most powerful city in the northern parts of the country, (v. 10. C.) not far from the Cæsarea, ( M.) which was built by Philip, where Lais stood before. H.—Josue burnt Asor to the ground; but it was rebuilt by the Chanaanites, and a powerful king reigned here, and subjugated the Israelites about 130 years after the death of Josue. Judg. 4:1. C.—Being the most interested in this warfare, Jabin assembled all the petty kings of the country as far as Dor, to resist the common enemy. H.—He was the generalissimo, (Grot.) and went to stop the progress of Josue, who had conquered the southern parts, and was making ready to march against the north.  
**2** *Ceneroth*, or having the lake Genesareth on the south. They city of Cineroth, or of Tiberias, was situated on the southern borders of the lake. S. Jerom.—*Side.* Dor lay on the Mediterranean, the last of the cities of Phœnicia. All below was in a manner subdued. The Philistines did not enter into this league, nor were they invited, as they bore a certain antipathy to the people of Chanaan.  
**3** *Chanaanite.* Some lived near the Jordan, others upon the Mediterranean.—*Maspha* *.* Probably where Laban and Jacob had met. Gen. 31:48. *Hermon* lay to the east of Libanus. C.—There was another Hermon near the torrent of Cisson. M.  
**4** *Shore.* The Scripture sometimes uses an hyperbole, as well as the other figures of speech. S. Aug. C. D. xvi. 21. Josephus says they had 300,000 foot, 10,000 horse, and 20,000 chariots. These were frequently armed with scythes. The ancient heroes often fought on chariots of a different kind. C.  
**5** *Merom*, or the lake of Semechon, according to most interpreters; though it is more probable, that the confederates would advance to meet Josue near the lake of Cisson, to the important pass 12 miles north of Samaria, in the canton of Meron, or Merone. Judg. 4:10 and 5:18. This place was famous for the victory of Barac, and for the defeat of king Josias.  
**6** *Hamstring their horses*, &c. God so ordained, that his people might not trust in chariots and horses, but in him. Ch.—He mentions the very time, when the victory will be obtained, to inspire the Israelites with greater confidence. Josue had proceeded from Galgal to Meron, about 90 miles; or if he had to go to the Semonite lake, 120 miles. Josephus says he had marched five days.  
**8** *Thereof.* Josue divided his forces, and sent some to pursue the fugitives to Sidon and Sarepta, and others he dispatched to the east side of the Jordan.—*Sihon* was famous for its commerce, and for its glass works. Plin. v. 19.  
**10** *King.* Jabin had thrown himself into the city, or perhaps a new king had been appointed, according to the custom of Persia, &c. when the former went to battle. Hence we find so many kings of Israel were chosen very young and while their fathers were living.  
**12** *Him.* Deut. 7:22 all the Chanaanites in arms, are ordered to be slain. C.—Josue took the greatest part of the strong cities, and indeed all which he attacked. M.  
**13** *Fire.* Several towns built on eminences, were reserved to keep the country in subjection. But it was thought proper to destroy Asor. Heb. may be, “He burnt not the towns which remained standing, with their fortifications,” &c. or such as had opened their gates to the Israelites. Chal. Sept. &c.)  
**14** *Spoil*, excepting what was found on the idols, which was burnt. Deut. 7:25. C.  
**15** *Moses.* It is not to be doubted but that the lawgiver would communicate many instructions, by word of mouth, to his successor. He would also tell him, in general, to observe whatever laws had been given to regulate the conduct of the leaders, ( C.) as they were given not only to Moses, but to all who should afterwards occupy his post. H.  
**16** *So.* Here follows a recapitulation of the victories of Josue.—*Israel*, or of Ephraim, which was the chief tribe of the kingdom of Israel: after the commencement of which, this seems to have been inserted; ( C.) or having designated the southern parts by the name of *Juda*, (v. 21,) the more northern countries are called the *mountain of Israel*, which refers particularly to Samaria, or Bethel, which might receive the appellation of *Israel*, among his descendants, from the vision of the ladder, with which that patriarch was favoured. H.  
**17** *And part.* Heb. “from Mount Halak, ( H. or the bald mountain, destitute of wood) going up to Seir, (which is very shady; that is, from the southern parts of Chanaan, by Seir) as far as Baalgad,” on the east side of the Jordan, perhaps unto Cœlosyria. C.  
**18** *A long time.* Seven years, as appears from C. 14:10. ( Ch.) where Caleb informs us that he was 85 years old. He was 40 when he went to explore the country, and 38 years were spent in the wilderness. God was pleased to allow the Chanaanites time to repent, and he would not render the country desolate all at once, lest wild beasts should overrun it. Ex. 23:19. Wisd. 12:10. C.  
**20** *Hardened.* This hardening of their hearts, was their having no thought of yielding or submitting: which was a sentence or judgment of God upon them, in punishment of their enormous crimes. Ch.—God might indeed by his all-powerful grace have changed their hearts, but their crimes caused him to withhold that grace; and thus they were suffered to shut their eyes to their true interest. C.—They alone therefore were the cause of their own obduracy, which God only did not prevent. Ex. 7. W.  
**21** *Time.* Among his other conquests, after the victory of Gabaon, Josue defeated the Enacim at Hebron, &c. Many of them fled into the country of the Philistines, and afterwards seized an opportunity of re-establishing themselves, so that Caleb had to drive them out afresh. C. 15:14.—*Cities*, or inhabitants. We have seen that he did not demolish all the cities, which were built on a commanding situation, v. 13.—*Enacim* *.* Goliah is supposed to have been of this family, being *six cubits and a span* high, 1 K. 17:4. C.—The Phœnicians probably took their name from Enak, *bene anak*, “sons of Enak;” whence Phœnix might easily be formed. Bochart.—Carthage was founded by them, and styled *Chadre-Anak*, “the dwelling of Anak,” (Plautus) as they chose to pass for descendants of that giant, though they were not in reality. Anak means “a chain;” and some have asserted that he wore one, as the kings of the Madianites did when they were vanquished by Gedeon, and the *Torquati* at Rome, as a mark of honour. But this is uncertain. C.  
**22** *Gaza*, the most southern city of the Philistines, was afterwards taken by the tribe of Juda, but lost again in a short time. It was particularly addicted to the worship of Jupiter, *Marnas*, or “the Lord.”—*Geth* was probably taken by David, who found a refuge with its king, 1 K. 21. After the reign of Solomon, it returned to its former masters.—*Azotus*, or as the Heb. writes, Asdod, on the Mediterranean, was noted for the temple of Dagon, (1 K. 5:1,) which Jonathas destroyed. Joseph. xxii. 8. C.—*Wars*, of a general nature. The different tribes had only to take some cities. C. 15:1. W.

**1** *Wilderness.* Heb. “all the plain country (*Arabia*) on the east.”  
**2** *Galaad.* Sehon occupied from the middle of the torrent Arnon, as far as half of the mountains of Galaad, and the torrent Jaboc. C.—Og possessed the other half of the mountains northward, while the Ammonites had the eastern parts. H.  
**3** *Bethsimoth* is ten miles from Jericho, (Eus.) near the Dead Sea, in the plains of Moab. C.—*Phasga* *.* Asedoth lay at the foot of this mountain, being well supplied with water. *Subjacet Acedoth usque Phasga*, the southern limits of Sehon’s dominions had “abundance of springs, as far as Phasga.” H.  
**4** *Og.* See Num. 21:33. Deut. 3:11.  
**7** *Seir.* The same expression occurs, C. 11:17. Heb. “from Baalgad, in the vale of Libanus, even unto Mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir.” H.—Halak means, “bald or naked.” It is not know what mountain it denotes. Josue, ( C.) or the Israelites, ( H.) conquered “all the country beyond the Jordan, on the north from Baalgad, at the foot of Libanus, and from Hermon, where these mountains meet, as far as the mountains of separation,” which divide the country of Chanaan from that of Seir, on the south of Judea. C.—Baalgad was situated on the north *western* borders of this territory, not of the Jordan. H.  
**8** *Asedoth*, or “in the springs,” or valleys, v. 3.  
**14** *Herma*, “a curse,” where the Israelites defeated king Arad. Num. 14:45 and 21:3.  
**15** *Odullam*, ten miles east of Eleutheropolis, and famous for the retreat of David. C.  
**16** *Bethel.* Josue perhaps slew the king, but did not take the city. Judg. 1:22. M.  
**18** *Aphec* *.* A place of this name was in the tribe of Aser, another in that of Juda.—*Saron.* Heb. “Lasharon;” probably *Sarona*, (Acts 9:35,) or a canton near Joppe. Euseb.  
**19** *Madon*, or *Maron*, Sept. C. 11:1. This place is joined with Semeron, in Heb. (v. 20,) improperly. Perhaps it may be the *Meros*, (Judg. 5:23,) or Maronia, a city of Phœnicia.  
**21** *Thenac*, a city of the Levites, but seized afterwards by the Chanaanites. Judg. 1:27. It was near the town of Legion, built by the Romans.—*Mageddo*, where Josias was overcome, 2 Par. 35:22. C.  
**22** *Jachanan* was near Mount *Carmel.* Sometimes Josue specifies both the city and the canton, where it was situated; at other times he only mentions the latter, as in the following verse.  
**23** *Galgal*, not where the Israelites had encamped, but that part which was afterwards called the *Galilee* of the Gentiles, in some corner of which the king in question had fixed his residence. For we cannot suppose that he ruled over all that country, extending from Tyre to beyond the Jordan. His people might probably be a mixed multitude of various nations, as Strabo (xvi.) observes, that many parts of Palestine were peopled by men of this description.  
**24** **V** **er.** **24** **.** *Thersa* *.* Here the kings of Israel kept their court, till Amri built Samaria, ( C.) about nine miles more to the north. Brocard.—*One.* The two kings slain by Moses ( W.) are not included. M.

## Chapter 13

**1** *Age.* Josue was now 100 years old. He lived ten more, ( C.) having governed the people in all 17. H.—During the first seven years, he had performed all that could be expected from an able general, and he probably designed to conquer the whole country before he divided it. But God, who chose to leave some of the ancient inhabitants in the country, to try the fidelity of his people, &c. ordered him to proceed to the distribution, that the different tribes might take care to exterminate those idolaters, who might be found in their territory.—Lot*.* Heb. “to be possessed.” Only the country east of the Jordan was yet divided.  
**2** *Galilee.* As Josue had been making such conquests in that part lately, some would translate Geliloth, “the confines” of the Philistines, in which sense it seems to be taken. C. 18:18, and 22:10. C.—Bonfrere suspects that S. Jerom wrote Galila.—*Gessuri*, either near Mount Hermon, ( M.) or bordering upon Arabia. 1 K. 15 and 27:10.  
**3** *Egypt.* Heb. “from the Shicor, (or Sichor) which is on the face, (or over-against) Egypt.” Jeremias (2:18,) informs us that this river was *in Egypt* which is not true of the torrent of Rhinocorure; which the Sept. and many commentators, understand in this place to be the boundary fixed for the promised land. Strabo, &c. attribute that torrent to Phœnicia; which they extend as far as Pelusium. S. Jerom (in Amos vi.) seems dubious whether the branch of the Nile passes by that city, or the aforesaid torrent be meant. David collected all his forces from the Sichor, or the torrent of Egypt, to the entrance of Emath, 1 Par. 13:5. Epiphanes constituted Lysanias governor of all the countries between the Euphrates and the river of Egypt, (2 Mac. 3:32,) and he undoubtedly had extended his conquests as far as the Nile. Though the country beyond Gaza be now mostly barren, and therefore little inhabited or noticed, yet the Israelites were entitled to assert their right to it, as they seem to have done by taking possession of Gosen. C. 10:41. Some parts were formerly well peopled, 1 K. 27:8. It is not unusual for the Nile, and other great rivers, to be styled torrents. The Heb. nel, is often applied to rivers. Eccle. 1:7. The *troubled* state in which the waters of the Nile generally appear, is very remarkable, as their taste is most excellent. The natives have discovered a method of rendering them clear, by the mixture of almond powder. The names of this river bear some relation to the Heb. term which is here used. It was formerly called Sirius. The Ethiopians style it Schichri. Another name was Melas, or Egyptus, denoting “blackness.” The people of the country idolized this river, because it supplied the want of rain. Tibul. i. 8. C.—*Accaron*, the most northern city of the Philistian principalities, ( H.) attributed to Juda or Dan, though neither held it for any length of time. Beelzebub was chiefly adored here, 4 K. 1:2.—*Lords*, who seem to have been independent. They are styled *Sornim*, as the next in dignity to the king of Persia was a *Surena.* Marcellin. 24. The Philistines took this country from the Chanaanites, or Eveans, ( C.) who are a different people from the Hevites. Bochart.  
**4** *Ch* *anaan.* From the south to Sidon was yet undivided, and thence eastward, ( H.) to *Apheca* of Syria, were was the capital of the kings of that country, and a famous temple of Venus, 3 K. 20:26. Sozom. i. 58.—*Amorrhite*, or perhaps Aramean, ( C.) though we may understand that all the country of the Amorrhite on the south, as well as the northern parts of Chanaan, were to be divided, ( H.) as far as Emesa.—*Will*, &c. provided the Israelites observe their part of the covenant. C.  
**8** *With whom.* That is, with the other half of that same tribe.  
**9** *Aroer*, and part of the town of *Dibon*, belonged to Gad. Num. 32:34.  
**13** *Day.* The Israelites were satisfied with what they had already conquered. M.—But herein they deserved blame, as they were ordered to reduce them entirely, and never suffer them to continue their idolatrous practices in the country which God had chosen for his people. H.  
**14** *Victims.* Heb. “the sacrifices of the Lord made by fire.”  
**18** *Mephaath*, near the desert, where the Romans afterwards kept a garrison. It was given to the Levites, but was seized by the Moabites after the reign of David. C.  
**21** *The princes of Madian.* It appears from hence that these were subjects of king Sehon: they are said to have been *slain with him*, that is, about the same time, but not in the same battle. Ch.—After the death of their sovereign, they looked upon themselves as independent. They had reigned before as viceroys of Sehon, being natives of the country, and not come from some other part, like the Amorrhites. C.  
**22** *Slain.* Sept. “they slew Balaam … with the sword in the moment.” Num. 22:5 and 31:8. H.  
**25** Rabba, “the great,” being a title of Ar, the capital of the Moabites. The Israelites thought themselves justified in keeping what had been taken from the children of Ammon, by Sehon, (Judg. 11:13. C.) and the Amorrhites. W.  
**27** *Betharan*, which was enlarged by Herod, and called Livias, or Julias, as the Greeks called Livia, the wife of Augustus, Julia. Joseph.—*Saphon*, or “the northern part of,” &c.  
**30** *Towns*, which were conquered by Jair, of the tribe of Juda; though he belonged, in some degree, to that of Manasses, by his grandmother. Num. 32:41.

## Chapter 14

**1** *Princes*, whose names are given. Num. 34:17. There were 12, including Josue and Eleazar. The tribes of Ruben and Gad sent none of their princes, as they were not concerned in this distribution.  
**2** *Tribe.* God regulated the lots, as he had authorized Jacob and Moses to foretell how the country should be divided. By this method, he precluded every pretence of discontent among the tribes. Each of them drew a ticket, on which a certain portion of land was described; or perhaps in one urn the names of the tribes, and in another the lands were specified, ( C.) and the tickets were drawn by two persons of irreproachable character, probably by Eleazar and Josue. H. Num. 26:54.—Only the tribes of Juda and of Joseph received their portions at Galgal. C. 18.  
**4** *Suburbs.* A certain quantity of ground, which the Levites were not allowed to till or plant with vines. Grot. Num. 35:4.—The tribe of Manasses, which was divided, fell heir to the portion which would have been allotted to Levi, who was also scattered among his brethren. H.—Thus Joseph obtained the birth-right of Ruben. C.—Twelve portions were made, as Jacob had adopted Ephraim and Manasses. Gen. 48. W.  
**5** *La* *nd:* or they were making all necessary preparations for the work, when Caleb came to remind Josue of what had been promised to him. No doubt land-measurers would be sent through the country.  
**6** *Je* *phone* was the father of Caleb. Esron and Cenez probably some of his ancestors, 1 Par. 2:18. Num. 33:12. What Caleb here asserts, must have been delivered by word of mouth, in the hearing of the people. Deut. 1:36. Moses declared not that Caleb was to have the whole country but that he should enter into it, and possess the environs of Hebron. C.  
**11** *March.* Heb. “to enter and to go out.” Sept. add, “to war.”  
**12** *Me.* He trusts not in his own strength, but in the assistance of God, which he modestly acknowledges is not due to him. C.—God’s promises are indeed sure on his part; but being conditional, and the will of man being free, he adds *perhaps.* W.  
**13** *Blessed him*, wishing him all success.—*Gave him.* Some think that Josue himself attacked the giants of that country with all the forces, as it is mentioned by anticipation. C. 10:28. But there seems to be no need of this, as Caleb might attack them a second time with his own family and the assistance of the tribe of Juda, after they had seized those places again, while Josue was in the north. Hebron was granted to him without drawing lots. When he was besieging Cariath Sepher, he promised his daughter to the person who should first enter; and Othoniel, his brother, or nephew, obtained her in marriage. C. 15:17. Judg. 1:10. It seems, therefore, that this family carried on this war, as the *Fabii* did at Rome, without the interference of the commonwealth, though Grotius asserts the contrary. C.  
**14** *Hebron belonged*, &c. All the country thereabouts, depending on Hebron, was given to Caleb; but the city itself, with the suburbs, was one of those that were given to the priests to dwell in. Ch.—Caleb might also dwell, ( C.) and be lord of the city, (Salien) though the profits ( H.) or the town belonged to the priests. C. 21:11. W.  
**15** *Cariath Arbe*, “the city of Arbe,” and ancient giant; or “of four,” which the Jews explain of four great patriarchs, who were buried there.—*Adam*, &c. S. Jerom seems to favour the opinion that Adam was one of these, whose tomb ennobled Hebron, though many of the Fathers think he was buried on Mount Calvary. Others think that his body, or skull at least, was translated thither. But we cannot depend on any of these traditions. Most commentators explain the Heb. “The ancient name of Hebron with Cariath Arbe; ( C.) he was a man great among the Enacim.” H.—*Adam* is often put for a man in general, 2 K. 7:19. Ose. 11:4. C. Amama.—Sept. “the city of Arbo. This was the metropolis of the Enacim.” H.—*Wars*, for a time, particularly from such wars as engaged the attention of all Israel. The different tribes had to encounter and drive out the Chanaanites who might be left in their respective districts. C.

## Chapter 15

**1** *Sin*, or *Sina*, (v. 3,) bordering upon Idumea, where the city of Cades-barne was situated. Num. 13:22. It is now impossible to ascertain the precise situation of all the place mentioned in Scripture, as the land of Chanaan has been subject to so many changes. But this inconvenience attends all ancient geography. If those who attempt to unravel such labyrinths in profane authors, deserve praise, much more do those who do their utmost to explain the difficulties of sacred history. It was once very necessary to have the limits of the tribes marked out with precision, that, at the return from captivity, they might occupy their own. Now we may be satisfied if we can point out some of the places of the greatest importance. The limits of the tribe of Juda are specified with particular care, on account of the dignity and power of that tribe, which was to give kings to all the land, and a Messias to the world, as well as to preserve the true religion. The greatest part of the southern regions of Chanaan fell to their share, from the Dead Sea, by Idumea, to the Nile, and as far north as Jerusalem and the torrent of Cedron. C.  
**2** *Bay*, (*lingua*,) tongue. Chal. “a promontory,” or rather a gulph. C.  
**3** *Scorpion.* A mountain infested with those creatures, by which people travelled from Idumea into Chanaan, leaving *Sina* on the left.  
**4** *Asemona*, which lies nearest to the river of *Egypt* of all the cities of Juda. Num. 34:4. C. 13:3.  
**5** *Jordan*, where it discharges itself into the Dead Sea, or mixes its waters with the latter; which, as we observe, (C. 5:16,) does not take place for three miles. H.—the north-western part of this sea belonged to Benjamin.  
**6** *Stone.* It is not certain that this was a city.  
**7** *Galgal.* Heb. Gilgal, may designate “the limits.” The valley of Achor lay south of Galgal.—*Sun.* Heb. “Hen-Shemesh.” It was not “a city.”—*Rogel*, “of the fuller.” This fountain was in the king’s gardens, running eastward from Sion into the torrent of Cedron. Joseph. vii. 11. It was used to wash linen. *Rogel*, signifies “to trample on,” as they formerly washed their linen with their feet. Nausicrae is represented in Homer doing so, in holes or basins, prepared for the purpose. Odys. Σ.  
**8** *Ennom* *.* Hebrew, Ge-ben-Hinnom, or simply Ge-ennom, whence Gehanan has probably been formed. In this vale, children were immolated to Moloc: the beating of drums, to hinder their lamentations from being heard, caused it perhaps to be called *Tophet.* It was to the east of Jerusalem, ( C.) inclining to the south. H.—*Northward.* The valley extends south to Bethlehem. Joseph. vii. 10. Her David gained a great victory, 2 K. 5:23. C.—*Woods.* This explanation is added by S. Jerom. H.—The ark remained at this city for some time, 1 K. 15:6. It was 10 miles north of Jerusalem.  
**10** *Bethsames*, “the house of the sun,” was at the same distance, westward. Here the sight of the ark proved so fatal to 50,070 of the inhabitants, 1 K. 6:19. C.  
**13** *Arbe*, who was *the father*, and the *greatest man* of the race of *Enac* *.* C. 14:15. H.  
**14** *Enac* *.* These three giants were at Hebron when the spies came thither. Num. 13.  
**15** *Letters*, as the Sept. render it. S. Jerom adds this interpretation. H.—It means literally “the city of the book.” *Senna*, may also mean “instruction,” v. 49. Here probably a famous school was kept, before the arrival of the Israelites; or the archive of the nation might be deposited among these giants, as the Chal. *Kiriat-arche*, “the city of the library, *or* archives,” insinuates. Bochart. Phaleg. ii. 17.  
**16** *Wife.* Parents had full authority to do this. Saul promised his daughter to the person who should overcome Goliah. Something was required by way of dowry for the lady. Grot. 1 K. 17:25.  
**17** *Brother.* It is not clear in the original whether this relates to Cenez or to Othoniel, ( H.) as *younger* is not found in Heb. but it is in the Syr. Sept. and Judg. 1:13. Many think that Cenez was the brother of Caleb. If Othoniel had been brother of the latter, they say he could not have legally married his niece. C.—But though Moses forbids a nephew to marry his aunt, it does not follow that uncles could not take their nieces to wife, as they would be still the head; ( W.) whereas there would be a sort of indecency for a nephew to command his aunt. The Jews allow these marriages, while the Samaritans condemn them. Lev. 18:14. In confirmation of the Vulg. we may remark, that Cenez is never ( C.) clearly ( H.) represented as the brother of Caleb; and there is no inconvenience in asserting that Othoniel was the *b* *rother* of the latter, whether we take this word to denote a near relation, or strictly. In the former supposition, Othoniel might marry his cousin, Axa, the daughter of Caleb, while he himself was descended from Cenez, the brother of Jephone. C.—But if we take the word strictly, as the remark of his being *younger brother*, both here and Judg. 1:13 may seem to imply, we must then allow that Othoniel followed the custom of his nation, ( H.) in marrying his niece. M.—Sept. here make him “the younger son of Cenez, who was brother of Caleb;” and in the Book of Judges, they say, “Gothoniel, the son of Cenez, (and) the younger brother of Caleb, first made himself master of it, under him;” as if Othoniel and Caleb had been born of the same mother, but of a different father, unless we suppose that they were only nearly related, and the former much less advanced in years; so that he might will marry the daughter of Caleb and afterwards become a judge and deliverer of Israel. Judg. 3:9. See Masius. Bonfrere. H.  
**18** *Was moved;* as the Syr. Arab. Junius, &c. represent the matter. Others render the Heb. in a different sense: “she moved him to ask of her father a field, and she lighted off *her* ass, and Caleb said unto her,” &c. which seems very abrupt, as she herself is represented as soliciting for the favour in the next verse, instead of her husband. The Chaldee supposes that she was restrained by natural modesty, from preferring the petition; but when Othoniel refused to do it, or was denied what he requested, she took courage and asked herself. The sense of the Vulgate seems more natural, ( C.) as the husband might easily suppose that she would have greater influence with her father. H.—*Sighed.* The original term is found only in this history, and in that of the death of Sisara. Judg. 4:21. Sept. “she cried out.” Others translate, “she remained fixed,” ( M.) or “she waited sitting on the ass,” till she had obtained her request.  
**19** *Blessing*, or “favour, present,” &c. 1 K. 25:27. C.—*And dry.* This is a farther explanation of *southern;* as the lands in that situation being exposed to the sun-beams, in Palestine, are often destitute of sufficient moisture, which is the cause of the sterility of Mount Hebal, &c.—*Watery ground.* Heb. “springs of water, and he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.” Aquila leaves springs untranslated. H.—*Golgot.* Sept. “Golathmaim, and the upper Golath,” &c. Sym. translates “possession on the high places.” Judg. 1. C.—Caleb had probably given his daughter a part of the mountain. He now grants her also some field that lay lower down, and was better supplied with water on all sides ( H.) by springs above, and cisterns below.  
**25** *New Asor*, to distinguish it from the capital of Jabin, in the north. This was dependent on Ascalon. Euseb.—Heb. “and Hazor, Hadatta, and (or) Kerioth (“the towns”) of Hezron, which is Hazor.” The Sept. only specify the same town of Asor by different names. There was one towards Arabia. Num. 11:34.  
**28** *Bersabee*, noted for the residence of Abraham, &c. It is attributed to Simeon, (C. 19:2,) with some other of these towns, as the two tribes lived intermixed, and some changes might be made in the first regulation, to bring things to a greater equality, and as circumstances might require.  
**31** *Siceleg* *.* The Philistines kept possession of it till king Achis gave it to David; and it continued afterwards the property of the kings of Juda.  
**32** *Villages.* Twenty-nine of the former cities were of greater note; the six, or taking in the three belonging to Caleb, the nine others which are mentioned, ( C.) were only *villages.* M.—Others think that these nine towns are not numbered here, because they were allotted to the tribe of Simeon. C. 19:2, &c.  
**33** *Plains.* Heb. Schephela, near Eleutheropolis. Chap. 10:40.—*Estaol* was afterwards given to Dan. Samson was buried near it and *Sarea* *.* Judg. 16.  
**36** *Fourteen.* One of those mentioned above, may have been a village. M.—Others think that *Enaim* may be the name of a *fountain*, near which perhaps Juda met Thamar. Gen. 38:14.  
**44** *Ceila*, which David took from the Philistines, and were he was nearly betrayed into the hands of Saul, 1 K. 28. Habacuc was buried here, on the road between Eleutheropolis and Hebron.  
**55** *Carmel.* Not where Elias dwelt, but a city and mountain 10 miles east of Eleutheropolis. Nabal rendered it famous by his imprudence, (1 K. 25) and Saul by a triumphal arch, 1 K. 15:12.  
**58** *Bessur.* About 20 miles from Jerusalem, fortified by Simon, 1 Mac. 14:33. It is there said to be only five stadia distant from that city. But the Alexandrian copy reads *five schœnus*, or cords, each of which consisted of at least 30 stadia. Cellarius.  
**59** *Eltecon* *:* given afterwards to the tribe of Dan, (C. 19:44,) and then to the Levites. C. 21:13. The Alex. Sept. here add many cities, which are omitted in Heb. C.—“Theco and Ephrata, (this is Bethlehem) and Phagor, and Artam, and Koulon, and Tatami, and Sores, and Karem, and Gallim, and Baither, and Manocho, eleven cities and their villages.” H. See S. Jer. in Mic. v. 1. C. Deut. 27:4.—Dr. Wall says, “these cities were doubtless in the Heb. copy of the Sept.” and “they are of such a nature, that it is scarcely possible to think them an interpolation.” The former critic thinks “the omission in the Heb. was occasioned by the word *villages* occurring immediately before, and at the end of the words thus omitted; and indeed the same word occurring in different places, has been the cause of many and great omission in the Heb. MSS. He thinks it less likely that the Jews should have *designedly* omitted Bethlehem here, because that place is mentioned as belonging to Juda, in several other parts of Scripture.” But is Ephrata ever joined with it, except in this passage, and in the text of Micheas? “And, therefore, though this remarkable omission was probably owing, at first, to some transcriber’s mistake, its not being reinserted might be owing to the reason specified by S. Jerom, out of malice to Christianity.” Kennicott, 2 Diss. 56.—Reland is astonished to find a place which was to be rendered so famous by the birth of the Messias, not enumerated in this place among the cities of Juda. But he observes that it is found in the Alexandrian version, p. 643. Palest.—S. Jerom will not decide absolutely whether the Jews have erased these cities, or the Sept. have inserted them. As he undertook to translate the Hebrew as he found it, he has not admitted these cities into his translation, though there seems to be abundant reason for supposing that they are genuine. H.  
**62** *Salt.* Bonfrere supposes it is Segor, which was preserved for Lot’s sake.—*Engaddi*, which was famous for its balm and palm-trees, in the desert of Jericho. Solin. xxxv.—We may here remark that in the preceding catalogues, many towns are repeated like *Zanoe*, (v. 34 and 56,) and others are left out. Some are also afterwards attributed to other tribes. Hence some have inferred that alterations have been made in the original copies. But we may rather believe that the reason of these variations is, because the cities were parceled out among the 10 families of Juda, (1 Par. 2:3,) as was the case in the distribution of land to Manasses; (C. 17:2,) and hence the same cities were sometimes given to two different families. They are also attributed to different tribes, because many families of the respective tribes dwelt in them. The priests, for example, lived along with their brethren of other tribes. C.  
**63** *Jerusalem.* The Benjamites claimed the northern part of this city; ( H.) and they did not drive out the Jebusites, but lived with them, Judges 1:21. The tribe of Juda had burnt a part of the city. Judg. 1:8. But it seems the Jebusites kept their hold, ( C.) at least in the citadel, ( H.) and frequently in the lower town, till they were entirely banished by David, 2 K. 5:7. See Judg. 19:11. In latter times, the Jews considered this place as the common city of all the nation, to which none of the tribes had an exclusive right; and hence, in the last siege, there was no head, and all the Jews were admitted without examination. Josephus. Bel. iv. 5, &c. C.—*Day*, and even till the reign of David. The author of this observation must have lived before that period. Josue might have made this and may other similar remarks, when he finished this work, towards the end of his life. H.

Gen. 28:19.—Bethel was probably the country, ( C.) or mountain, ( H.) to the east of Luza, on the frontiers of Benjamin and of Ephraim; for which reason it is sometimes attributed to both.—*To Atharoth.* This city, and *Archi*, are supposed by some to be the same city. Archi seems, however, to have been a distinct place, where Chusai ws born, 2 K. 15:32. Atharoth is styled *Addar*, “the illustrious,” v. 5. It was 15 miles from Jericho.  
**3** *Nether.* See C. 10:11. The upper Bethoron was of much less note, near the Jordan.—*Gazer* was in the vicinity of *Azotus*, 1 Mac. 14:34. C. 10:33. C.  
**4** *Possessed it*, or *divided* the country between them. The territories of Ephraim are henceforward described, to the end of the chapter. M.  
**6** *Looketh to the north*, &c. The meaning is, that the border went towards the north, by *Machmethath;* and then turned eastward to *Thanathselo.* Ch.—*Borders.* It should be *t* *erminus* *.* “The border turneth eastward.” Sept. Bonfrere.—*Janoe*, twelve miles east of Sichem. Euseb. 4 K. 15:29.  
**8** *Reeds.* Sept. “of Cana.” The vale belonged to Manasses, but the cities were ceded to Ephraim, v. 9. C. 17:16. The limits of these two tribes are very confused. C.—*Most salt.* This is the title generally applied to the lake of Sodom. But here the Mediterranean is meant, which, compared with many of the seas of Palestine, is certainly *most salt.* M.—The epithet is not, however, found in Heb. or Sept. ( C.) and Serarius thinks it has crept in here by mistake. M.  
**10** *Gazer.* It is not certain when the Ephraimites rendered this city tributary, or when it threw off the yoke. The king of Egypt afterwards conquered it, and gave it with his daughter to Solomon. C. 10:33. C. See Judg. 1:29.—The negligence of Ephraim was contrary to God’s order. Ex. 20. M.—The Alex. Sept. here inserts after *day*, “till Pharao, king of Egypt, went up and took the city, and burnt it with fire, and the Chanaanites and Pherezites, and the inhabitants of Gazer, he slew; and Pharao gave it as a dowry to his daughter.” Grabe adds what seems deficient, “and they became tributary slaves.” H.

## Chapter 17

**1** *Born.* Machir was the only son of Manasses. But the Scripture uses the word *first-born* for such, as it does for our Saviour. Mat. 1. M.—If Machir was living when Moses assigned the territory to the half tribe of Manasses, he must have been 180 years old. C.—But he probably received the inheritance only in his posterity. H.—*Galaad* did not give his name to the country, as it was called so in the days of Jacob. Perhaps he took his name from the land, as many noblemen do, though he is styled Galaad before the war against Sehon commenced. Num. 26:29. By giving Ephraim the preference before his elder brother, Jacob did not deprive the latter of his birth-right. C.—In effect, Manasses was partly ( H.) provided for before Ephraim received any portion. C.—This, however, was a privilege, and not a right. He had also two allotments, because his numbers required so much land. H.  
**2** *Children* here comprises grandchildren, &c. These who are specified sprang from Galaad or from Jair, as they all dwelt on the east side of the Jordan, 1 Par. 5:23 and 7:14. C.  
**4** *Father*, adjoining to Ephraim. See Num. 27 and 36.  
**5** *Jordan.* Some of the families, which had possessions there already, were permitted to have a share on the west side also. Here Manasses had ten portions, *schœnus*, or cords, which Herodotus (2:6,) reckons to contain each 60 stadia; so that he would have 600 stadia, ( C.) or at least half of that quantity. C. 15:58. (Herodotus ii.) H.—There were six sons and five daughters to be provided for. But the portion of Hepher, the father of Salphaad, being given to his granddaughters, his is not counted. Masius.—The Jews say the five daughters had only four portions, two for their grandfather, who, they say, was the eldest of the family; one for their father, and another for their uncle, who died without children. Selden.—But of this no proof is adduced. C.—The five daughters would only have the one portion, which would have been enjoyed by the father. M. See 1 Par. 5:23.  
**7** Aser was contiguous to *Machmethath*, 15 miles from Sichem, towards Scythopolis. S. Jerom. C.—The limits of Manasses are described from the south, where he joins Ephraim. C. 16:6. C.  
**8** *Taphua* *;* which city, though situated in the territory of Manasses, belonged to Ephraim, ( W.) as the Heb. intimates.  
**10** *East.* These two tribes are contiguous to the tribe of *Joseph*, taken all together, v. 14. M.—Aser extended as far as Mount Carmel, which was not far from *Dor*, a city of Manasses, v. 11. C. 19:26. The tribes of Issachar and of Zabulon seem, indeed, to come between Manasses and Aser; so that we might say, that the tribe of Joseph finding itself too much straitened, was forced to seek for more room in the cities of the other tribes, which we find it really inhabited, v. 11. We might avoid all difficulties, by translating “they invaded (or made an irruption into) the tribe of Aser,” &c. as the Heb. will allow. Thus Dan conquered Lais, which lies at so great a distance from his own portion, and the tribes of Juda and Simeon were frequently intermixed. C.—Aser and Manasses may, however, have been really united on the north-west, or Mediterranean point. M.  
**11** **V** **er.** **11** **.** *In Aser.* The following towns were upon the frontiers of these two tribes, ( M.) or they properly belonged to them respectively. But the children of Manasses took possession of them, after conquering by degrees, the former inhabitants, who were suffered to live among them, as the Jebusites were for some time, at Jerusalem. C. 15:63. H.—*Bethsan*, or Scythopolis, as it was called by the Greeks, after the Scythians had invaded those countries, (Herod. l. 105,) A.M. 3391, almost 100 years from the destruction of the kingdom of Israel. Unless these Scythians may rather be the Cutheans, who were sent to people the kingdom of Samaria, most of whom embraced the Jewish religion, while those of Bethsan adhered to their ancient idolatry, and therefore retained their name. Even in the days of Josephus, most of the inhabitants were heathens: the kings of Juda were not able to subdue them entirely. Bethsan was situated to the south of the sea of Tiberias, 600 stadia from Jerusalem; (2 Mac. 12:29,) that is, about 37 leagues, ( C.) or 111 miles. H.—*Dor*, nine miles north of Cæsarea.—*Endor*, “the fountain of Dor,” four miles south of Mount Thabor. Euseb.—Here Saul consulted the witch, 1 K. 28:7.—*Thenac*, near Legion, and the torrent of Cisson, where Barac gained a victory. Judg. 5.—*Nopheth*, means “a canton,” and thus Manasses may have had three portions of land round the three aforesaid cities, in which sense it is translated. C. 11:2. C. Masius.—But Serarius takes Nopheth to mean a city, ( M.) agreeably to the Sept. “the third part of Naphetha, and its villages.” H.—The other two parts of the city might be occupied by Zabulon. Bonfrere.—No mention is made of Nopheth. Judg. 1:27. H.  
**12** *Could*, because they would not. Judg. 1:27. The children of Manasses took these cities; but not putting the inhabitants to death, the latter got possession again, as was the case with respect to many other cities taken ( C.) and destroyed ( H.) by Josue. Heb. “the Chanaanites consented to dwell,” &c. The Israelites spared their lives on their paying tribute; and this prevarication was the cause of their being afterwards reduced to submit to the yoke of these nations. C. Judg. 2:20. Deut. 20:16. M.—The Chanaaites dwelt with Manasses for a time; ( W.) perhaps they were never wholly expelled. H.  
**14** *Spoke.* Sept. “contradicted Josue.” In effect, they spoke with a good deal of emotion.—*Porti* *on.* Heb. “cord.” C.—They addressed themselves to the general, before their territory was divided. Masius.—Or they insinuate that the portion allotted to them both, would scarcely suffice for one tribe, and there was but little room for them to enlarge their dominion by subduing the Chanaanites, as the rest might do. Manasses was most concerned, as his numbers had increased 20,500 since he left Egypt, while his brother had diminished. Num. 26:34. C.—But then he had an extensive country on the other side of the Jordan. H.  
**16** *Thee.* Destroy the Pherezite, &c. ( M.) take their cities, and destroy the inhabitants, like so many trees, or cut down the wood to build houses, and in order to cultivate the land for the production of corn and grass.  
**17** *Iron*, armed with scythes, who will obstruct our passage to the mountains, as we dare not encounter them in the open field. H. 4 K. 19:23.—Heb. “the hill is not enough for us, (or it will not be found, *or* be attacked by us) and all the Chanaanites,” &c. C.—Sept. “the mountain of Ephraim will not contain us; all the Chanaanites who dwell in the land of Emek, (of of the valley) in Bethsan, and its villages, and in the vale of Jezrael, have chosen cavalry and iron.” H.—They are invincible. C.—*The slothful man saith there is a lion without.* Prov. 22:13. Josue over-rules the cowardly objection, and argues, from their own boasting, that they were numerous enough to overcome all their opponents. He was himself of the tribe of Ephraim. H.—*Valley*, extending about 10,000 paces from Bethsan to Legion. Jezrael ws in the middle of it, and is attributed to Issachar. C. 19:18. But it was probably on the frontiers of Manasses, who seems to have spoken as if it would belong to the first who had driven out the Chanaanites. The kings of Israel had a palace at Jezrael, and the vineyard of Naboth being contiguous to it, gave occasion to the sin of Jazabel, and to the destruction of Achab’s family, 3 K. 21:1. In this vale, Gedeon routed the Madianites. Judg. 6:33.  
**18** *Mountain*, probably of Gelboe, as that of Ephraim was not sufficient, v. 15. Gelboe extended almost as far as Bethsan, and it would afford a fine opportunity of attacking the nations below. Josue persists in his first resolution; and though of the same tribe, he is so little actuated by partiality towards his brethren, that they alone seem to have been dissatisfied with their portion. C.

## Chapter 18

**1** *Silo* was delightfully situated, about the midst of the country, 12 miles south of Sichem. Hither the Israelites removed the ark from Galgal after having had their camp in the latter place seven years at least; the Jews say 14. But Josue might reproach the Israelites for their indolence, (v. 3,) without waiting seven years after the country was divided.—*Tabernacle.* The Jews pretend that this was not the same as that set up by Moses; and others say that *a house* was built for the Lord at Silo, 1 K. 1:23. But there seems to be no reason for these assertions. David informs us that the ark of the Lord was covered with *skins*, 2 K. 7:2. If any repairs were found necessary for the tabernacle erected by Moses, they might be made. The ark was certainly in it till the Israelites unfortunately sent it into the camp, where it was taken by the Philistines. When they sent back the ark, it was deposited at Gabaa, and not in the tabernacle, which was at Silo. Then it was sent to Nobe. We find the tabernacle was at Gabaon some time after the ark was translated to Jerusalem. C.—*Them.* They might, therefore, removed the ark into the interior, and measure the country without danger. M.—The greatest part of the country had submitted to Josue. C.  
**3** *Slack.* These seven tribes had been accustomed to live in indolence, having their food provided for them in a miraculous manner. They were perhaps afraid lest, if the army of Israel should be divided, the different tribes would be too weak to make head against the enemy. C.—Josue had, however, made all things easy, and they might at their leisure conquer the few towns which yet remained in the hands of the Chanaanites, if they had not cherished this indolent disposition, which was so displeasing to God, and brought upon them so many evils. H.  
**4** *Tribe:* it is not clear whether any but these seven were concerned.—*Out.* Josephus says, that people well skilled in geometry accompanied them. C.—They had to mark out seven portions of land, which might suffice for these remaining tribes, ( H.) who would receive them by lot, to take away all cause of discontent. They still received according to their numbers. Num. 26:54. W.  
**5** **Ve** **r.** **5** **.** *North*, with respect to Silo. Juda had taken possession of his territory, as well as the tribes of Joseph.  
**6** *The land in the midst, between these mark ye out into seven parts:* that is to say the rest of the land, which is not already assigned to Juda or Joseph. Ch.—For we must not suppose that Joseph occupied the most northern parts of the country, so as, with Juda on the south, to enclose all the other tribes. H.—Heb. “As for you, you shall describe the land into seven parts.” C.—Only the tribe of Benjamin was between these two tribes, (v. 11,) so that Serarius thinks that *mediam* had been substituted for *aliam*, “the other.” M.—Lots*.* The deputies divided the country into seven portions, equal in goodness, though not in extent. After the lots were drawn, some alterations might be made by common consent, and those tribes which were too much straitened for room, received what was requisite among those who had too large a territory. Hence we find Joseph occupying the cities of Issachar, &c. C. 17:10. It was equally inconvenient to have too much or too little.  
**7** *Priesthood*, and the rights attached to it, tithes, &c. C.—It was therefore necessary to make eight portions. M.  
**9** *Book.* Heb. “described it, according to the cities, into seven parts, in a volume,” ( H.) or table, resembling a map. The ancients commonly wrote on boards covered with wax, and engraved on stone, lead, &c.  
**11** *First.* A person might proclaim that the tribe, whose name was drawn first out of the urn, should have the territory which was described in the book by the land surveyors; or the names of the seven tribes might be in one urn, and seven parcels of land in another. C.  
**12** *Bethaven*, or Bethel. Josephus says, (Ant. v. 3,) that the territory of Benjamin extended as far as the Mediterranean: but it only went to Ataroth, v. 13. M.  
**15** *Sea*, on the west. H.—The northern limits of Juda form the southern ones of Benjamin, only here Josue proceeds in a contrary direction, from west to east. M. See C. 15:5, 8.  
**16** *Part.* Heb. “end, *or* summit.” C.—*That is*, &c. and explication added by S. Jerom. Some say this dreadful vale ( H.) was on the *south* of Jerusalem. Button.  
**18** *Hills.* Heb. Geliloth, “the limits,” ( C.) or Galgal, on the road to Jerusalem from Jericho, and different from that where the Israelites encamped, C. 15:7.—*Adommim* is a narrow pass in the vicinity, much infested with robbers.—*Abenboen* *.* The explication is alone given. C. 15:6.—*Plain.* Sept. “and it shall pass by Betharaba, on the south from the north, and it shall descend.” Grabe supplies “to Araba;” or the plain desert country. H.—Betharaba is, in effect, mentioned as one of the cities of Benjamin, (v. 22,) as it had before been assigned to Juda, ( C.) being inhabited by both tribes. H.  
**19** *Towards*, (*contra linguam*) “the bay on the north,” &c. H.—There is another on the south. C. 15:2.  
**21** *Vale* of *Casis*, “incision,” so called, as some pretend, on account of the balm, which was extracted by cutting the bark with a stone, or with glass. But this etymology seems too far fetched, and there is no proof that balm was cultivated there in the days of Josue. C.—Some of the cities of Benjamin have been here omitted, as two others are mentioned, C. 21:18. M.  
**24** *Ophni*, the Gophna so celebrated in latter times, fifteen miles from Gabaa. S. Jerom attributes it to Ephraim, as perhaps it was chiefly inhabited by people of that tribe.—*Gabee* *.* The wickedness of its citizens almost involved the whole tribe in destruction. Judg. 19. It was twenty mile north of Jerusalem. Joseph. v. 2.  
**26** *Mesphe*, where Samuel assembled the people, 1 K. 7:5. It was regarded as a place of devotion, while the temple was in the hands of the profane, 1 Mac. 3:46.  
**28** *Jebus.* The city was called Salem in the days of Abraham. Gen. 14:18. Ps. 75:3. S. Jerom supposes that Melchisedec resided near Scythopolis, at Salem. Gen. 33:17 ep. ad Evag. Usher thinks he lived at *Salim.* Jo. 3:23.—*G* *abaath* *.* There seems to have been two cities of this name; one famous for the tomb of Habacuc, (S. Jer.) and the other in the tribe of Ephraim. C. 24:33. C.

## Chapter 19

**2** *Juda.* Thus was verified the prediction of Jacob, that Simeon and Levi, who had been too much united for the destruction of Sichem, should be scattered among their brethren. Gen. 34 and 49:6. The tribe of Simeon was not very numerous. Num. 26:14. Yet all his cities are not here enumerated, but only such as served to point out the limits. The Jews suppose that this tribe occupied the cities of Juda only as long as the latter pleased, and that it was driven out of them in the days of David, (1 Par. 4:31. Rabbins ap. Mas.) or at least under the reign of Ezechias, when it was forced to seek fresh settlements in Gador and Seir, ib. v. 39. It was, however, led into captivity by Salmanasar along with the other nine tribes, in the sixth year of Ezechias, 4 K. 17:6. The lot of Simeon was not in the centre of Juda, but only within his limits, ( C.) either on the south, (Cellarius) or on the west side, ( C.) or on both. H.—*And Sabee.* This is the same town with the preceding, otherwise there would be 14 instead of 13, v. 6. M.—If this be not the case, we may give the same solution as C. 15:62.  
**4** *Bethul.* We shall see elsewhere whether this be the Bethulia of Judith. Some place a town of this name in Galilee, near Tiberias, (Brocard) of which, however, there is no proof. Cellar. iii. 31.  
**9** *Great.* The land measurers, it seems, had been under a mistake, ( M.) which was corrected by the ancients. Distributive justice was to be observed.  
**11** *From the sea.* Heb. “towards the sea.” Bonfrere asserts that Zabulon did not extend quite to the shore of the Mediterranean. C. 17:10. C.—*Torrent*, near Sidon, which some call the river Belus or Papis. Plin. v. 19.  
**13** *Geth-hepher*, the birth-place of Jonas, 4 K. 14:25. See C. 12:17.  
**15** *Bethlehem*, very different from that of Juda.—*Twelve.* Nineteen are mentioned, but some of them belong to other tribes, ( C.) or were not properly cities. M.—All the towns of Zabulon are not specified. C.  
**17** *Issachar.* The reason why he has been placed after his younger brother, Zabulon, both here and in the blessing of Jacob, is not known.  
**18** *Jezrael* *.* This was a city of the first note, ( M.) situated in the vale between Mount Hermon and Gelboe, having Bethsan on the east.—*Sunem*, where Eliseus raised the child to life, five miles south of Thabor. S. Jerom.—Here the Philistines were encamped the day before the battle, in which Saul was slain and Israel dispersed, 1 K. 28:4. C.  
**20** *Rabbath.* These four cities formed the western boundary, though Serarius observes, this tribe extended as far as the Mediterranean, being in possession of Carmel, which lay close to the shore. M.  
**21** *Engannim*, called Enam, 1 Par. 6:73.—*Enhadda* *.* There was another town of this name, 10 miles from Eleutheropolis. C.—This and the four following towns lay on the north of Issachar. M.—*Bethsames*, “the house of the sun.” Juda and Nephthali had also a Bethsames.  
**26** *Carmel*, so famous for the miracles of Elias, 3 K. 18:20. Josephus (Bel. ii. 17,) places it 120 stadia south of Ptolemais. This range of mountains extended northward through the tribes of Issachar and of Zabulon. Pliny (v. 17,) speaks of a promontory and of a town of this name. Here also the god Carmel was adored, having an altar, but no temple or image, as the ancients had decreed. *Nec simulacrum Deo aut templum, (sic tradidere majores) ara tantum et* *reverentia* *.* Tacit. Hist. ii. 78.—Vespasian consulted the priest Basilides. Carmel means “the vineyard of the Lord,” or the excellent vineyard, &c. It was so rich and beautiful as to become proverbial. The spouse compares the head of his beloved to Carmel. C. 7:5. Isaias (32:15,) foretels that the deserts shall be equal to Carmel. It was covered with wood and fruit. S. Jerom in Isai. x. 18. Jer. iv. 26. The city, which was built upon this mountain, and which Pliny calls by the same name, was formerly styled Ecbatana. The oracle had denounced to Cambyses that he should die at Ecbatana, and he concluded that the city of Media was meant; but it was “that of Syria,” says Herodotus, (iii. 64,) where he died.—*Labanath* *.* Heb. leaves out the conjunction.—*Sihor* means a “troubled” river, (C. 13:3,) or brook, which probably ran near the white promontory mentioned by Pliny, (v. 19,) near Tyre. *Labanath* signifies “white.”  
**27** *Bethdagon* *.* “The temple of Dagon, *or* of the fish,” different from the town of Juda. C. 15:41.—Zabulon, a city which took its name from the tribe, and separated Ptolemais from Judea. Joseph. Bel. ii. 37.—*Left;* that is, the north *side of Cabul*, which means either the canton where the 20 cities of Hiram were situated, or a village which Josephus (Vita) calls Chabolo, which lies near the sea, and Ptolemais.  
**28** *Rohob*, on the northern extremity of the land. Num. 13:22. It was assigned to the Levites. But the tribe of Aser never drove out the Chanaanites. Judg. 1:31.—*Cana*, where Christ wrought his first miracle, about 23 miles west of Tiberias, as we may gather from Josephus. (Vita) Cellarius.—Some would admit another Cana nearer Sidon.  
**29** Horma. Heb. Sept. &c. *Rama*, “a height.”—*Of Tyre.* When this city was founded, is wrapped up in obscurity. The Tyrian priests claim a very high antiquity; whereas Josephus (Ant. viii. 2,) allows that the city was founded only 200 years after Josue, on which supposition this name must have been added by a subsequent writer. The matter, however, is so uncertain, that nothing can be concluded. It was a colony of Sidon. Isai. 23:12. Old Tyre was on the continent; the new city was built in an island, where the temple of Jupiter Olympius formerly stood. Alexander made a road between the two cities, when he besieged New Tyre: which, on that account, may be considered either as an island, or as part of the continent. He used for this purpose the ruins of the old city, which he threw into the sea. Hiram had formed a similar road to the temple of Jupiter. Dius. ap. Joseph. c. p. 1. Whether Nebuchodonosor besieged the Old or the New Tyre, soon after he had taken Jerusalem, authors are not agreed. S. Jerom (in Ezec. xxviii. Amos i. &c.) seems to think that he attacked the new city; whereas Marsham believes that it was built only after the other had fallen a prey to the arms of the Chaldees. It was only five or 700 paces from the continent. *Tyrus quondam insula præalto mari septingentis passibus divisa, nunc* *vero Alexandri oppugnantis operibu continens* *.* Plin. v. 19.—*Portion.* Heb. “from the coast of Achzib,” which is the same town as Ecdippe, south of Tyre, and nine miles from Ptolemais. C.  
**30** *Amma;* perhaps on mount Amana, a part of Libanus. Cant. 4:8. For though the Israelites had possession of these parts only a short time, they had a right to them, and to the countries as far as the Euphrates and Pelusium. Sept. read, “Akom or Archob,” ( C.) in some copies, though the Alexandrian agrees with the Vul. H.—Perhaps Acco, the ancient name of Ptolemais, may be meant, as it is hardly probable that so famous a city should be omitted.—*Aphec*, beyond Antilibanus, from which city the Israelites could not drive the Chanaanites. Judg. 1:31. Here the kings of Syria assembled their forces to attack the people of God, 1 K. 20:26. Profane authors speak of the temple of Venus Aphachitis, who appeared in the eyes of the superstitious to shed tears. The city lay between Biblus and Heliopolis. Zozimus, i. 58. Euseb. (laud. Const.) Macrobius i. 21.—*Twenty-two.* More are mentioned above, but some might belong to other tribes.  
**33** *Heleph* seems to have been on the north-eastern limits of Nephthali. The cities on the Jordan southwards, as far as Genesareth, are specified. H.  
**34** *Juda* was in possession of the southern parts of the Jordan, as Nephthali had the northern, so that by means of navigation they might enjoy the riches ( C.) of each other, and of the other tribes. H. Deut. 33:23.—Sept. do not read *Juda*, which forms all the difficulty, as five tribes lay between these two. They have “and the Jordan is towards the rising sun.” C.—Grabe inserts, with a star, “*to Juda*, the Jordan,” &c. intimating that *to Juda*, was not a part of the Sept. version.  
**35** *Ser.* The Sept. seem to have read rather differently. “And the fortified, *or* walled cities of the Tyrians, Tyre and Emath, (and) Bekkath,” &c. H.—*Assedim* may be the name of a people. The situation of *Ser* is also unknown.—Emath is the famous Emesa. Num. 13:22. C.—Tyre, &c. belong to Aser, and not to Nephthali, as the Sept. might insinuate. But Emesa would be within the borders of the latter. H.—*Cenereth*, the lake of that name, as S. Jerom says that the city of Cenereth was Tiberias, on the southern extremity of the lake whereas Nephthali possessed only the northern part. C.—Bonfrere supposes that Caphernaum, or some adjacent city, is meant; and indeed the first words of the verse indicate that a list is given of the *strong cities*, unless that should be restricted to those of the *Assedim*, which are not specified. H.  
**36** **Ve** **r.** **36** **.** *Arama* *.* Heb. “Rama.”—*Asor*, the capital of Jabin. C. 11:1.  
**37** *Enhasor*, “the fountain of Asor,” or Daphne, a delightful spot resembling the famous suburbs of Antioch. Josep. Bel. iv. init.  
**38** **V** **er.** **38** **.** *Bethanath*, “the house of poverty,” is Betanea, 15 miles from Cæsarea. Eus.—*Nineteen.* Twenty-three places are mentioned. But some might only be villages, &c. C. 15:62.  
**41** *Sun.* Some suppose that it is the same with Bethsames of Juda, which was ceded to the Levites. C.—Dan lay on the west of Juda. H.—*Selebin*, where the Amorrhites maintained themselves. Judg. 1:35.  
**43** *Themna* *;* the Thamna of the tribe of Juda. C. 15:10.—*Acron*, or Accaron.  
**44** *Elthece*, or Elthecon of Juda, given to the Levites. All the three tribes might dwell in it.  
**45** *Barach* *.* Heb. “Bene-barac,” or “Jud, of the sons of Barac.”  
**46** *Mejarcon*, “the waters of Jarcon” and *Arecon*, were near *Joppe.* C.  
**47** *There.* Heb. “and the limits of Dan went out from them. They were not able to keep the cities in subjection; so that, finding themselves too much confined, they sought for fresh settlements at Lessem; or, their borders were known by these cities, through which they passed, ( C.) though most of them had been already assigned to the tribe of Juda. M.—*Dan.* This city was not Peneas, or Cæsarea, but the utmost boundary of Palestine on the north, as Bersabee was on the south. This history is given more at large. Judg. 18:1. The Sept. vary from the Heb. in the 46. 7 and 8 verses, ( C.) and add that “the children of Dan did not destroy the Amorrhites, who afflicted them in the mountains, and would not suffer them to descend into the plain … But the land of Ephraim lay heavy upon them, and they became tributary to them. (See C. 17:13.) 49. And they went to take possession of their limits, and the children of Israel,” &c. H.  
**50** *Lord*, by the mouth of Eleazar. Josue was content with one of the most barren parts of the country. He waits till all are provided for, shewing throughout his life a pattern of moderation and disinterestedness, which render him worthy to be considered as a figure of Jesus Christ, who reduced himself to the lowest state of abjection for our sakes. C. See C. 14:6. M.—*Ephraim.* It was before called *Gaas* *;* and the city, which Josue enlarged, lay on the north side of it. C. 24:30. Judg. 2:9.

**3** *Of blood*, and authorized to kill the manslayer, ( M.) if he find him out of one of these cities. See Num. 35:6. Deut. 19:4. Revenge was never lawful: but to prosecute offenders in the courts of justice, ( C.) or agreeably to the law of God, can never deserve blame. H.—If some of the saints of the old law seem to have taken delight in revenge, their expressions must be explained in a favourable sense. David, who is accused of this crime, ( C.) repels the charge with horror. Ps. 7:5. The evils which he denounces to his adversaries, were predictions of what they had reason to expect. Ps. 57:11. Jer. 11:20. H.—If some of the Jews looked upon vengeance as lawful, it cannot be a matter of surprise, when we reflect that even some, who have been taught the mild law of the gospel, think themselves bound, in some cases, to revenge an affront. C.—So far have the maxims of the world supplanted Christianity in their breasts! How severely does Jacob rebuke his children for what they had done to the Sichemites, though they falsely thought that the affront offered to their sister, would justify them! Gen. 34. H.  
**4** *Gate*, where justice was administered. M.—Here the ancients heard what the manslayer had to say in his own defence; and if they thought his account plausible, they gave him a retreat till he might be safely brought to answer the charges of the avenger, who might endeavour to prove that the murder was wilful.  
**5** *Before.* This is generally taken literally. But if sufficient proof could be brought that the contending parties were at variance, or reconciled some time before the accident happened, the person who had taken refuge, would be judged accordingly. It might lawfully be presumed that they were enemies, if, after being at variance, they had given no signs of reconciliation. C.  
**6** *Fact.* Sept. “before the synagogue for judgment.” H.—Whether this took place in the same city, or where the murder was committed, (see Num. 35:12 and v. 25) the reasons are given why the manslayer was released at the death of the high priest. C.—By the death of Christ, the greatest criminals are redeemed. M.  
**7** *Cedes* and *Gaulon* lay on the north, *Sichem* and Ramoth in the middle, *Hebron* and *Bosor* on the south of the country. H.  
**9** *Strangers.* The limitations of the Jews in favour of their own nation are rejected. The civil and criminal law should affect all alike, except, God order it otherwise.—*Stand.* This was the posture of the people accused, while the judges sat. Drusius. C.

## Chapter 21

**1** *The priest*, who seems to have presided, as he is always placed first. A select number of the tribe of Levi came to represent the priests, and those of an inferior order; and to obtain what God had promised them. Num. 35:2. There was one family of priests who sprang from Aaron, the son of Caath. The rest of Caath’s family, with the children of Gerson and Merari, were simply Levites, constituting three other families. God was pleased that they should be dispersed through Israel, that they might instruct the people both by word and by example, 1 Par. 26:29. C.—Josue would not have neglected them. M.—But they were naturally solicitous to know where they were to live, as the tribes had now all received their portions. H.  
**3** *Gave*, by lot, v. 4, &c. M.—Whether any changes were afterwards made, to grant more or less, in proportion to the numbers of the four families, (as seems to have been done with regard to the other tribes) or the cities were specified in four parcels, and the priests received the first lot, the text does not explain. C.—It is also uncertain what right the Levites had to these 48 cities. Some say that they had only the use of them, while others maintain that the cities were their property entirely, so that no other could live there without their consent. They could sell the houses, which returned to them in the year of the jubilee, if not redeemed before; but the suburbs were a common property of all the Levites, and could not be sold by any. Lev. 25. The cities, therefore, belonged to God, and he abandoned the property to his ministers. Other people might live among them, as they were not debarred from choosing their habitation in places which were not originally allotted to them. Thus we find that Gabaa was chiefly people by the tribe of Benjamin, when the outrage was offered to the Levite’s wife, and no blame attached to the latter. Judg. 19. Saul and his family were of the same town, though it belonged to the Levites, and David kept his court at Hebron, a sacerdotal city, for the first seven years of his reign. C.—Here also Caleb had probably resided. C. 14:14. The priests and Levites were not indeed at this time sufficiently numerous to people all these cities; and Calmet supposes that they only received as many houses as they might occupy, being supplied with more by the magistrates as their numbers increased. But might not they let the houses, which they did not want to occupy, and receive the profits, so as to take possession of them when they had occasion? Were these 48 cities, which were the only part of the land to which the Levites had any claim, too many or too rich to compensate the labours of this most deserving tribe? It seems, therefore, unnecessary to call in the aid or interference of the magistrate, except any person were so bold as to refuse to give up what the law had so positively assigned to the Levites. Their rights were as well defined as those of any of the other tribes. H.—The land beyond the suburbs, was cultivated by the proprietors, who might either live in the town or country. Many of the priests and Levites chose to reside near the tabernacle, as Moses had encouraged them to do. Deut. 18:6. Thus Nobe became a sacerdotal city; (1 K. 21:1,) and after the temple was built, Jerusalem and its environs were the places of abode for most of the priests. C.  
**4** *Thirteen.* These three tribes give more cities than any of the others, because their territories were the largest. Num. 35:8. Juda in particular, had a most extensive portion allotted to him at first; so that a part was afterwards taken away to accommodate Simeon and Dan, and now so many cities are appointed for the priests, ( C.) who would thus have their residence near the temple, when it should be built. H.—God ordered the lots according to the designs of his providence; and gave the priests, though so few in number, more than what fell to the share of all the rest of the family of Caath. C.—This family had in all twenty-three cities, lying south of Dor and Bethsan, and leaving the tribe of Issachar on the north. Gerson had thirteen cities among the three other northern tribes, and that of Manasses on the east side of the Jordan; while Merari had twelve, more southward on the same side, in the tribes of Gad and of Ruben, and on the west of the Jordan, in the tribe of Zabulon. Thus these two families were more intermixed. H.  
**12** *Possession.* Only the houses which the priests occupied, were taken from him. C.—Caleb enjoyed all the dependencies of Hebron, and took the city, as he would not have been secure while the Chanaanites dwelt there. Magalian.—Serarius thinks that he abandoned the city to the priests, in which he follows Tostat, who supposes that they had to pay tribute to the tribes among whom they lived; and that mines, &c. belonged to the latter. M.  
**16** *Ain and Jeta.* Sept. of Grabe agrees with the Vulg. But the Vatican copy ( H.) has, “Asa … and Tanu.” In 1 Par. 6:59, only *Asan and Bethsemes* are mentioned. Several other variations may also be observed, which may be attributed either to the changes which were afterwards made when the Chanaanites kept their hold, (Rabbins) or to the different places having two names, or to the mistakes of transcribers, &c. See C. 15:62. Only eleven cities are specified in the Book of Paralipomenon, though it observes that there were thirteen. C.—*As hath*, &c. words added by S. Jerom, or rather expressing more fully the Heb. “those” *two tribes.* H.  
**21** *One of*, (*urbes confugii Sichem … and Gazer*.) Lit. “cities of refuge, Sichem, … Gazer,” &c. as if all the Levitical cities had enjoyed this privilege, which we have seen (Num. 35:6,) is the opinion of some. But the Heb. Sept. and Chal. read in the singular, “Sichem, a city of refuge;” and interpreters generally allow only six cities of this description. C.—Without extending this privilege to all the rest, we may observe that all the cities of refuge were given to the Levites, v. 11. 21–7–32–6–7. Prot. “For they give them Shechem, with here suburbs in Mount Ephraim, *to be* a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gazer,” &c. By inserting *to be*, they seem to countenance the opinion that all the subsequent towns were of the same nature as Sichem. The text would be clearer without the addition, to prove the contrary sentiment. H.—See Bonfrere how the Vulg. may be vindicated. M.  
**22** *Beth-horon.* Grabe’s Sept. adds, “the upper,” which is the received opinion. C.  
**23** *And of*, &c. This verse is omitted in Paralipomenon, ( H.) whence we find Helon and Gethremmon (probably the same as Aialon and Beth-remmon, v. 24, assigned to Ephraim.—*Eltheco* *.* See C. 15:59 and 19:44.—*Gabathon* continued a long time in the hands of the Philistines. 3 K. 15:27.  
**25** *Cities.* Instead of these, *Aner and Balaam* are mentioned in Paralipomenon. C.  
**26** *Degree*, who were not priests. Caath is placed before his eldest brother Gerson, on account of the honour of the priesthood and of Moses. M.  
**27** *Refuge.* Lit. “the cities of refuge, Gaulon … and *Bosra.*” See v. 21. H.—The latter gives place to *Asteroth*, in Paral.  
**29** *Cities.* These are called *Cedes and Daboreth, Ramoth a* *nd Amen*, in Paralipomenon.  
**35** *Suburbs.* Paralipomenon only mentions two, *Remmono and Thabor* *.*  
**36** *Four cities.* There are no more, though there be five names: for *Misor* is the same city as *Bos* *or*, which is to be observed in some other places, where the number of names exceeds the number of cities. Ch.—With regard to the 36th and 37th verses, there seems to have been great confusion in the Hebrew MSS. both ancient and modern. In some they have been totally omitted, in others only a part. H.—The famous MS. of Hillel, and the Masorets, reject them, ( C.) because they had reckoned only 656 verses in Josue, and these two verses would destroy their authority. Hence they erased them wherever they might be found; and Kimchi assures us, that he never could meet with them “in any MS. (thus) corrected.” Yet the Paralipomena universally acknowledge them, (Ken.) as the context of Josue must also do, otherwise there will be only eight cities instead of twelve, and four will be wanting to complete the number of forty-eight. The Prot. version therefore is forced to admit them, ( H.) as they are found in the Eng. Polyglot, on the authority of some ancient MSS. They do not, however, express them so fully as the Sept. have done. Ken.—These read, “And beyond the Jordan, over-against Jericho, out of the tribe of Ruben, the city of refuge for the slayer Bosor, in the wilderness, (Misor) and her suburbs, and Jazer and her suburbs, (37) and Gedson and her suburbs, and Mapha (Alex. copy reads Maspha) and her suburbs, four cities.” Grabe.—Prot. only admit, “And out of the tribe of Ruben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Jahazah … Kedemoth … and Mephaath with her suburbs, four cities.” Kennicott finds in some Heb. MSS. “the city of refuge for the slayer, Bosor;” one MS. has, “*in the wilderness*,” &c. H.—These verses were not in the Heb. text of the Hexapla, as they are obelized in the Sept. and in the Syriac MS. of Masius; and yet, as they are found in the old Greek and Syriac versions, and in the Chal. paraphrase, they were probably omitted between the year 100 and 200. They are left out in several printed editions of the Heb. Bible, and even in that of Jablonski, (1699) though in opposition to his better judgment and all the MSS. which he had consulted: *legunt omnia nostra MSS.* Michaelis (1720) reprinted this text, with some few e mendations, particularly with these two verse very laudably inserted. Kennicott, 2 Diss.—In the Bened. Edit. of S. Jerom, Martianay observes, that the Heb. MSS. of S. Jerom seem to have been mutilated, for if they had admitted this 36th verse, S. Jerom would have translated it, and it would have been found in the more ancient MSS. of the Latin edition, where it is wanting. Hence this editor leaves it out. He also remarks that other Heb. MSS. omit “a city of refuge for the slayer, in the desert.” The last word, he says, occurs in several copies of the best not; and Houbigant inserts it on the authority of the oratorian MS. 54. H.—In some editions of the Vulg. this verse is transposed, and placed after the cities of Gad. Louvain, R. Steph. &c.—It is therefore, probably that S. Jerom found it not in Heb. but, if he inserted it, he borrowed it from the Sept. The Syriac version places these verses before the 34th and 35th. All this shews that the Heb. MSS. have not been kept with great care in this place. Some have surmised that the Sept. have inserted this necessary supplement from Paral. But they do not entirely agree with that book, so that it seems that they found these verses in their Heb. copies. C.—We have already given the Hebrew and Sept. as it is found in the common editions. In Paral. (6:78,) it is thus expressed: *Beyond the Jordan also, over-against Jericho, on the east side of the Jordan, out of the tribe of Ruben, Bosor* *in the wilderness, with its suburbs, and Jassa …* 79. *Cademoth also … and Mephaath with its suburbs.* The word Misor, which Grabe’s Sept. and the Vulg. leave untranslated, is the Heb. word which denotes *a plain*, ( H.) as Aquila and Sym. agree, and as appears C. 20:8. Deut. 4:43, where Bosor is said to have been *upon the plain of the wilderness.* This city was the famous Bosra, in the desert Arabia, between Philadelphia and Jazer, towards the east. C.—We might translate, “the cities of refuge, Bosor in the wilderness, *which is also* the plain” of Moab, v. 21. H.—*Jaser*, or Jassa, (C. 13:18,) different from that v. 37, which lay on the river of the same name in the tribe of Gad. C.  
**40** *Families*, the four great ones, which parcelled out the cities among the several branches. H.—The Levites were only 23,000, (Num. 26:62,) yet they receive more cities than what are specified for any other tribe. It must be observed, however, that all the cities of the different tribes are not mentioned, and the Israelites might live along with those of the tribe of Levi, v. 3. Moreover, these had only the cities, with 2000 cubits of land round them. The Sept. here insert that Josue divided the land, and received the city of Thamnasachar; (Grabe substitutes Thamnasarach) where he deposited the knives of stone with which he had circumcised those who were born in the desert. H.—They farther remark, that they were buried in his tomb. C. 24:30.  
**43** *Pass.* How then did the Chanaanites keep possession of so many places? S. Augustine (q. 21,) answers, that they were suffered to do it for the “utility and trial” of the Israelites. For the latter were not sufficiently numerous at first to cultivate all the land. God had therefore promised that the nations should not be driven out all at once, lest the country should fall a prey to wild beasts. Ex. 23:29. Masius.—During the life-time of Josue, none of them durst make head against him; and if many of the tribes did not take possession of all their cities, it was owing to their own negligence. After this hero was no more, the natives took courage, and greatly harassed the Israelites; but it is plain that the latter were not straitened for room, while Josue lived, since they invited the other tribes east of the Jordan to come and reside with them on the west, if they thought proper. C. 17:16. C.

## Chapter 22

**1** *Time;* before the assembly broke up. The 40,000 had continued to fight along with their brethren, ( C.) as long as there was occasion. Now peace being obtained, they are permitted to return to their families. H.  
**4** *And peace.* This is a farther explication of *rest*, ( H.) which alone occurs in Hebrew. It may denote a fixed and permanent abode. Deut. 3:20. Ruth 1:9.  
**6** *Blessed* *them*, like a good magistrate, having given them a solemn admonition not to forget God, the source of all blessings. H.—This expression may also intimate that he loaded them with praises and with presents, and wished them all prosperity.—*Dwellings.* Lit. “tents,” in which they had been accustomed to live, in the desert. Hence they gave the name to houses, temples, &c.  
**8** *Riches.* Heb. Sept. &c. “cattle.”—*Brethren.* Grotius pretends that they were to keep what they had gotten. But his proofs rather shew that they were to follow the ancient custom and law, which prescribed that those who had remained at home to guard the country, should share the booty with those who had gone to battle, 1 K. 30:24. Num. 31:27. Some suppose that the booty was divided into equal parts, and the 40,000 would retain as much as all the rest of their brethren, who had been less exposed. The Israelites, however, made all alike, as other nations seem to have been. Ex. 15:9. &c.  
**9** *Galaad* here denotes all that country, ( C.) as Chanaan does that on the west of the Jordan ( H.) and Ephraim, the ten tribes. C.  
**10** *Banks.* Heb. Goliluth, which is (C. 13:2, &c.) rendered *Galilee*, Galgal, “limits,” &c. H.—Chanaan, consequently on the western banks. Vatable, however, says that the eastern country went sometimes by this name, on account of the Amorrhites having dwelt in it. Josephus (v. 1.) and the Jews affirm, that the altar was built on that side; and it seems natural that these tribes would erect it in their own territories, for the benefit of their children. C.—The effect would nevertheless have been equal, on which side soever it appeared, as the Jordan was not so broad but they might see over. H.—*Immensely.* Heb. “a great altar to be seen,” like those heaps which Bacchus and Alexander raised to perpetuate the memory of their victories. Plin. vi. 16.  
**12** *In Silo*, without being called, as they were all fired with a holy zeal, ( M.) to prevent the growth of idolatry among their brethren. H.—They knew that one altar was to be allowed M. in the place which the Lord should appoint. Lev. 17:8. Deut. 12:5. &c. H.—God had ordered such cities as embraced idolatry among them, to be exterminated. Deut. 13:12. C.  
**14** *Tribe.* Another of the tribe of Levi, and deputies from the other nine tribes, accompanied Phinees on this important occasion. The Levites were most of all concerned, as their rights seemed to be particularly invaded. H.—The princes of the tribes did not ( C.) perhaps ( H.) go, but only men of high rank. Kimchi says, men set over a thousand. Heb. “ten princes with him of each chief house, a prince of all the tribes of Israel.” C.—These were commissioned by Eleazar, Josue, and all the congregation, to endeavour to bring back their brethren to a sense of their duty, if they had so soon forgotten God, ( H.) or if they should persist in their rebellion, to denounce an eternal war against them. M.  
**16** *Lord.* Thus Phinees shews that he speaks in the name of those who still continued faithful to the Lord. He imputes the crime of apostacy to Ruben, &c. that they may declare more openly for what reason they had built this altar. M.  
**17** *Beelphegor* *.* As they lived in the country, where this idol had been adored, Phinees was afraid lest they might have built the altar in his honour. He reminds them what destruction that worship had brought upon all Israel. He had been particularly zealous in appeasing the wrath of God, and therefore speaks with more authority. Heb. “is not the crime of Phegor enough for us, that we should not wish to expiate it until this day?” ( C.) or Prot. “is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day? (although there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord).” The stain of this impiety still remained upon Israel. They ought, therefore, to endeavour by sincere repentance, to obliterate it entirely, and not, by fresh provocations, enkindle the dreadful wrath of God. H.—There was reason to fear lest the Lord should punish this sin still more, as he is accustomed to do, when people relapse. C.—All must therefore shew their zeal to prevent such crimes, as the multitude sometimes suffers for the offence of one, when they do not take all possible care to prevent it, v. 20. H.  
**19** *Unclean*, as being destitute of the ark, &c. The Israelites had the greatest veneration for the land which God had chosen for their habitation. Naaman loaded two mules with some of the earth. We cannot help admiring the zeal and the disinterestedness of Phinees. He proposes to abandon some of the possessions on the other side of the Jordan, rather than that his brethren should forsake God, or offend him.  
**20** *Wickedness.* Heb. “he did not expire in his sin,” ( C.) but repented; ( H.) or, Did he not? &c. The Sept. “he did not alone die in his sin.” Chal. “but this man alone did not die in his transgression.” C.—All Israel was in consternation, and 36 were slain. If this secret offence was so severely punished, what judgments will not the public apostacy of so many thousands draw upon our heads!  
**21** *Israel.* Sept. “answered the Chiliarchs of Israel,” who had spoken by the mouth of their president. They repel the charge with earnestness. H.  
**22** *God.* In Heb. there are three terms, ( C.) El, Elohim, Yehova, “the strong, the judge, the self-existent Being.” To him they make their appeal. Him they acknowledge in the first place, as the only true God, as they had been accused of departing from him, v. 19. H.—They are willing to undergo any punishment, if they had any evil intention. M.  
**23** *Sacrifice.* Heb. intimates particularly “of flour or libations.” C.  
**24** *To-morrow.* At any future period. H.—*Israel.* The same idea is expressed, v. 27. *You have no part in the L* *ord.* You are not his peculiar people. Of this title the Israelites were always very jealous, even when they neglected the worship and covenant of the Lord. C.—Hence these tribes take these precautions, that they may not be excluded from the society and privileges of their brethren on the other side of the Jordan. They profess openly that they do not esteem it lawful to offer sacrifice in any other place, besides that which God had chosen. H.  
**31** *Lord*, who would not have failed to punish Israel for such a crime. C.—They rejoice, therefore, not only at the fidelity of their brethren, but also on their own account, because they may now confidently look up for protection to God, instead of being in continual apprehensions of feeling his avenging arm. H.  
**32** *Into*, &c. (*finium Chanaan*) “of the confines of Chanaan,” which is ambiguous. H.—But the Heb. removes the difficulty in this manner.  
**34** *God.* Heb. seems rather defective; ( C.) “called the altar, (Syriac supplies the altar of witness) for it shall be a witness between us, that the Lord he is the God. *Ed*, “witness,” is placed in the margin of Plantin’s edit. (Kennic.) and the Prot. have inserted it in the text, though in a different character, ( H.) as “it is confirmed by the Syr. Arab. and Vulg. versions.” Kimchi quotes the Chal. paraphrase, as having the word seid, “witness,” twice, which if read in two places formerly, has been lately omitted in one, as many other alterations have *perhaps* been made in it, in conformity to the later copies of the Hebrew text. It is still found in one Chal. MS. and in that of Masius. Between the two last words of this verse, some Heb. MSS. read eva, “He.” “The Lord, He is the God;” which not only gives an emphasis, but is expressly confirmed by the Chal.; and indeed this seems to have been a common form of confessing the belief in the one true God, 3 K. 18:39. Kennic. Diss. i.—Masius would translate, “They made an inscription upon the altar, declaring that it should be an eternal witness of their attachment to the Lord.” *Cora*, in effect, sometimes means to write, as *Alcoran*, in the Arabic tongue, signifies “the scripture” ( C.) of the Mahometans, which they hold in the utmost veneration, as containing the life and doctrine of their great prophet. The Sept. (Grabe) insinuate that Josue approved of what had been done, “and Jesus gave a name to the altar, … and said, it is a witness in the midst of them, that the Lord God is their God.” Thus, instead of war and destruction, which seemed to threaten Israel on all sides, all ended in peace and harmony. If Christians would imitate the conduct of the Israelites, they would not so rashly condemn their neighbours on every idle report; and, if our adversaries would condescend to examine seriously into the grounds of charging idolatry upon us, and on that account waging an eternal war against us, it is to be hoped they would pronounce our doctrine innocent, and reform their own iniquitous proceedings. H.

## Chapter 23

**1** *Long time.* Josue governed only ten years after the distribution of the land. Towards the close of his life, perceiving that the Israelites were too indolent in subduing the people of the country, and fearing lest they should by degrees begin to imitate their corrupt manners, he called a general assembly either at his own city, or at Silo, or more probably at *Sichem*, (as it is mentioned C. 24:1, which seems to give farther particulars of this assembly) and laid before his people, in the strongest terms, the dangers to which they would be exposed, by entertaining a friendship for the enemies of God, and by abandoning him. C.—He called together all the heads of the people. M.  
**3** *For you.* God fought for his people three ways: 1. By destroying their enemies himself in a miraculous manner, as he did the Egyptians; 2. By assisting their endeavours, as at Jericho, and in the victory of Gabaon, when he caused the walls of the former town to fall down, and hurled stones upon the fleeing enemy near the latter; (C. 10) 3. By giving courage and strength to Israel, while he filled their opponents with dismay, and this was most frequently the case. He continues to assist his servants in their spiritual warfare against the world, the flesh, and the devil, in all these different ways. W.  
**4** *And now.* Heb. “Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations, which remain *to be subdued*, to be an inheritance for your tribes from the Jordan, (these two words are transposed, and should come after, C.) with all the nations that I have cut off—even unto the great sea westward.” He mildly expostulates with them for not following up his victories, by reducing the few scattered nations whom he had abandoned to them as a prey. H.—They ought to be considered not only as the enemies of God, but also as unjust detainers of another’s right, and Josue promises that nothing will be wanting on the part of God to render their reduction easy, if they will but do their duty to Him and to themselves. H.  
**7** *Come in*, an expression which may denote any familiarity, or marriage. M.—Heb. is in the form of a prohibition, “Come not among (have no connections with) these nations … Neither mention their gods, nor swear (or cause to swear by them.”) The psalmist (15:4,) says, speaking either of idols, ( H.) or of sinners, *Nor will I be mindful of their names by my lips.* Osee (2:16,) says, *She shall call me no more* **Baali**, (“my lord,” a term applied by wives to their husbands) on account of its reminding one of the idol Baal. Hence David calls Jerobaal, or Gedeon, Jeroboschot, 2 K. 11:21. S. Paul would not have Christians so much as to name the sins of impurity. Ephes. 5:3. The more religious Jews will not even mention an idol, or an unclean animal; and they beg *pardon* before they speak of a heretic. Drusius.—Some understand that the worship of idols is meant by naming them, as those who invoke the name of Jesus Christ, were his disciples. Acts 9:14. 1 Tim. 2:15. Ex. 20:24. To swear by idols is always sinful, (Ex. 23:13,) while it is an act of religion to swear on proper occasions, by the name of God. Theophrastus (ap. Joseph. c. Ap. i.) observes, that the laws of the Tyrians prohibit the using of foreign oaths, such as that of the Corban, which was peculiar to the Jews. C.  
**8** *Day.* Those who had formerly given way to idolatry were all cut off, and all Israel had lately given a proof of their attachment unto the Lord. H.  
**10** *Thousand.* This Moses had repeatedly foretold. Lev. 26:13. Deut. 28:7.  
**13** *Side.* Heb. “snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your side.” Children and slaves were formerly beaten on this part, Eccli. 30:12 and 42:5. Horace (epod. iv.) says, *Ibericis peruste funibus latus* *.* The first word S. Jerom seems to have read with *th* at the end, as *peth*, means a hole, ( C.) by which means it was customary to take wild beasts, and to annoy the enemy. H.—Sept. render *side*, “they shall be nails in your heels.”  
**14** *This* *day:* shortly I must die. C.—*Metam properamus ad unam* *.* (Hor.) “We hasten to one common goal.” H.—The pagans called death, or the grave, *the common place;* and Plautus says, in the same sense, *Quin priu* *s me ad plures penetravi* *.* ( C.) “Before I penetrate the receptacle of the many.” H.—*Mind.* Heb. “you know in your hearts, and in all your souls;” you are convinced, you cannot be ignorant that God has fulfilled his engagements. C.—The Sept. read, “you shall know,” &c. The experience of future ages will only establish this truth more fully. H.  
**16** *And speedily.* This word is added to express the force of the Heb. term. M.—“Punishment is seldom lame in overtaking the wicked. H.—*This.* He emphatically sets before them what labours they had sustained in making the acquisition, and what ingratitude they will be guilty of, if they ever forfeit so great a blessing. M.—The treat or prediction was verified during the captivity, and still more after the destruction of Jerusalem. C.

## Chapter 24

**1** *Of Israel.* There seems no reason for restricting this to the *ancients*, &c. On this solemn occasion, when all Israel was probably assembled at one of the great festivals, Josue concluded his exhortation, by renewing the covenant ( C.) in the place where he had formerly complied with the injunction of Moses. C. 8:31. H.—In Sichem, in the field which Jacob had purchased, and where a great *oak* (v. 26,) was growing, that had been honoured, it is thought, with the presence of the patriarchs. It was near the two famous mountains of Garizim and Hebal. C.—Sichem was at the foot of the former mountain of blessings; and Josephus informs us, the altar was erected in its vicinity. No fitter place could therefore have been selected by the aged chief, to conclude the actions of his life, and to attach the people to the religion which they had once received, in the most signal manner. The Vat. and Alex. copies ( H.) of the Sept. followed by S. Aug. (q. 30,) read Silo, where the tabernacle was fixed: but all the rest agree with the original, and with the ancient versions, in retaining Sichem, to which place the ark was removed on this occasion, ( C.) the distance of ten (S. Jer.) or twelve miles. Eus.—It is not probable that an oak would be growing in the sanctuary, near the altar, contrary to the express prohibition of the Lord, v. 26. Deut. 16:21. C.—Many interpreters suppose that the assembly might be held at Silo, in the territory of Sichem. T. M. Serarius.—But the distance seems too great; and Bonfrere rather thinks that the copies of the Sept. have been altered. H.—Salien remarks, that they might go in solemn procession from Sichem to Silo. A. 2600.  
**2** *Of the river.* The Euphrates. Ch.—*Gods.* Some think that Abraham himself was in his youth engaged in the worship of idols, (though this is denied by S. Aug. C. D. xvi. 13. Theod. q. 18, &c. W.) as well as his father, &c. v. 14. Gen. 11:31. Thare was the father of both Abraham and Nachor, (Gen. 11:26,) unless ( H.) the grandfather ( M.) of Abraham was meant, who was also called Nachor, ( H.) as well as Rebecca’s grandfather. Gen. 24. W.  
**3** *From the.* Heb. and Sept. “other side of the flood *or* river,” where *M* *esopotamia* commences. H.  
**4** *Isaac*, the promised seed and heir of the blessings, ( C.) after Ismael was born. H.  
**6** *You.* Many still survived, and had seen these wonders, as God had only exterminated those who had murmured.  
**9** *Fought*, not perhaps with the sword, but by endeavouring to get Israel cursed, that so he might be unable to make any resistance. He had the will to fight, and in this sense princes are said to be at war, though they never come to an engagement. 3 K. 14:28. C.—Balac shut his gates against Israel. S. Aug. q. 26.  
**11** *Men.* Heb. “the masters of Jericho,” which may denote either the king or the inhabitants. It is thought that people of the different nations were come to defend the city, or the text may signify that not only Jericho, but these different people, ( C.) fought successively against the people of God, but all in vain. H.—The fighting of the inhabitants of Jericho was only intentional; a miracle rendered all their efforts abortive. Yet this is called fighting in scripture (v. 9,) as well as in other authors. “We judge of actions by the intention, says S. Isidore: (Pelus. ii. ep. 289,) the person who intended to murder is punished, though he only inflicted a wound; and on the other hand, he who dills undesignedly receives a pardon.” So Orion was said to have violated Diana, because he wished to do it; and Virgin, (viii.) speaking of some who already thought they were in possession of the capital, says, *Galli per dumos aderant, arcemque tenebant*, “they seized the citadel,” though they never entered it. C.—Yet it is probable that the inhabitants of Jericho would defend themselves. M.  
**12** *Hornets.* S. Aug. explains this of the rumours, or devils, which terrified the people of the country. But it is generally understood literally. Wisd. 12:8. M. Ex. 23:28. C.—*The two*, &c. not only the nations on the west, but also those on the east side of the Jordan, who fell, not so much by the valour of the Israelites, as by the terror and judgments of God. H.—The resistance which they made was hardly worth mentioning.  
**14** *The gods.* Some still retained in their hearts an affection for these idols, though privately; ( C.) so that Josue could not convict them, or bring them to condign punishment; as no doubt he, and Moses before him, would have done, if they had been apprized of any overt act of idolatry. Amos (5:26,) says, *You* *carried a tabernacle of your Moloch and the image of your idols*, &c. which is confirmed by Ezechiel 23:3. 8 and Acts 7:42. For these acts many of the people were punished, (Num. 25:3. 9,) and the rest were either sincerely converted, or took care to hide their impiety till after the death of Josue. Yet the secret inclination of many was still corrupt; and these no sooner found a proper opportunity than they relapsed repeatedly into the worship of idols, for which reason the prophets represent their disposition as criminal from their *youth.* H.—S. Augustine (q. 29,) cannot think that the people, who are so often praised for their fidelity during the administration of Josue and of the ancients, (C. 22:2 and 23:3. 8 and 24:31,) and who had testified such zeal against every appearance of idolatry in Ruben, (C. 22) should be themselves infected with this deadly poison. He therefore supposes that Josue exhorts them to repent, if any of them should have retained a predilection for the worship of their ancestors in Mesopotamia, and in Egypt, ( C.) which, by the prophetic light he say, was secretly the case. W.—Yet, though the great majority was clear of this crime, it seems many concealed from their leaders their secret attachment to it, v. 23; ( C.) or if they were sincere, for a time, their former bad habits soon gained the ascendancy, and involved them in perdition. H.—*Fathers.* He does not exempt Abraham, and the Jews acknowledge that he was once an idolater, which is the opinion of S. Ephrem, of the author of the Recognitions, B. i., and of many moderns; some of whom think that S. Paul gives him the epithet of impious, or *ungodly*, on that account. Rom. 4:5. The idolatry of the Hebrews in Egypt, is no less certain than that of their ancestors in Mesopotamia. Ezec. 23:2. 8. 27. C.  
**15** *Choice.* Josue was persuaded that no restraint could bind the will; ( H.) and that, if the Israelites did not freely adhere to the Lord, they would not serve him long, nor would their adoration have any merit. C.—Hence he endeavours by all means to draw from them a free and candid acknowledgment of his divinity; and he leads the way, by declaring that all his *house* will adhere to the true and only God. They answer his fullest expectations, and profess in the most cordial manner, that every tie of gratitude must bind them for ever to the service of the same Lord. H.—Elias makes a similar proposition; (3 K. 18:21. See Eccli. 15:18. M.) not that it can be ever lawful to choose evil and to reject the sovereign good. But by this method the minds and hearts of the audience are stimulated to make the free and decided election of what alone can ensure their eternal happiness. H.—Thus we often set before the people hell or heaven for their choice. M.  
**19** *You will not be able to s* *erve the Lord*, &c. This was not said by way of discouraging them; but rather to make them more earnest and resolute, by setting before them the greatness of the undertaking, and the courage and constancy necessary to go through with it. Ch.—Josue knew the fickle temper of his subjects. He insinuates, therefore, that if they do not lay that aside, they will not stand to their engagements, ( C.) and will irritate God the more, if they enter into a covenant with him, and afterwards prove inconsistent. Heb. La thuclu, “you cannot,” may perhaps have the first *u* redundant; (Ken.) as that is a letter which is often inserted or omitted at the transcriber’s pleasure. Aben Ezra Simon.—Hallet suggests that we ought to read *lo thucelu*, “you shall not cease,” which would obviate the apparent difficulty of Josue’s attempting, as it were, to cool the fervour of the people, by insinuating that they will not be able to stick to their resolutions, and that at a time when he is exerting every nerve to make them sensible of their duty, and to engage them to swear an inviolable fidelity to the Lord. “Cease not to serve the Lord, for he is a holy God, he is a jealous God, he will not forgive your rebellion, (*Copssaco.* Job 34:27,) nor your sins; if you forsake the Lord, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and consume you.” Ken. Dis. 2.—If we were to read with an interrogation, “Will you not be able? &c. it might answer the same end. Josue may be considered as starting an objection, which is but too common in the mouth of the slothful, and of may of the pretended reformers, Luther, &c. who endeavour to persuade the world that they are not able to comply with the rigour of God’s law, and even make his severity an encouragement for their despair. Josue replies that these pretexts are groundless, and that God, who has already done so much for them, (v. 20,) will not abandon them in their wants, if they cry unto him; and that, instead of being dejected by the thought of his judgments, they ought to strive, with the utmost fervour, to comply with his divine will. H.—A general sometimes withholds the ardour of his soldiers, telling them that they are not a match for the enemy, in order to inflame their courage the more. M.—A torrent which has been long repressed, rushes forward with greater fury when the dam is broken down. H.  
**20** *Turn*, and alter his conduct in your regard, instead of being your protector, he will *destroy you.*  
**21** *Lord.* We shall not experience the chastisements with which thou hast threatened us, because we will adhere inviolably to the Lord. C.  
**25** **5** **.** *Covenant.* He renewed the one that had been formerly made, stipulating, on the part of God, that the people should serve Him alone, v. 23. After which he probably read some of the most striking passages of Deuteronomy, ( C.) particularly the Decalogue, or ten *commandments*, with the blessings and curses which enforced the observance of them. C. 5 and 27 and 28 and 29 and 30. H.—Then the people swore that they would observe the law, the customary sacrifices were offered, and a record of the whole was subjoined by Josue to that of Moses, in order that it might be deposited in or near the ark. Deut. 31:26. C.—This renewal of the covenant prefigured the law of grace. S. Aug. q. 30. W.  
**26** *Lord*, particularly what related to the ratification of the covenant, which was the last public act of this great man. He placed it in its proper order in the continuation of the sacred history, which Moses had commenced. H.—*Stone* unpolished, except where there was an inscription, relating what had taken place. M.—This monument of religion was not forbidden. Deut. 16:22. C.—*Oak.* Heb. alla, is translated a *turpentine tree*, Gen. 35:4. ( H.) and by the Sept. here. But most people translate *the oak.* Chal. Aquila, &c. Under it Jacob buried the idols of Laban, and Abimelech was chosen king; (Judg. 9:6,) as Abraham had entertained the angels under the same tree, Gen. 18:1, ( C.) and had sat under it when he first came into Sichem. Gen. 12:6. On which supposition it must have subsisted about 500 years. M.—It was even shewn some ages after Christ. But it is hardly credible that the same tree should have continued for such a length of time.—*Sanctuary*, or tent, where the ark was placed on this occasion under the oak. C. Bonfrere.—Some think it was at Silo. M. v. 1.—Kennicott denies that the ark was present, and supposes that they offered sacrifices upon the very altar which Josue had erected on Garizim, between 20 and 30 years before; and that this mountain is here called *the sanctuary* or “holy place.” Upon it the *oak* might very well grow, and Josue might “with great propriety take some large stone, and set it up for a witness, making at the same time this striking remark, that this stone *h* *ad heard all the words of the Lord*, or had been present when his law was inscribed and read to the people at their former solemn convention.” Hence he infers against Collins, “that the Jews had thoughts of worshipping, and did worship at Gerizim long before the separation of Israel from Juda;” and it was probably for fear of the Israelites returning to a sense of their duty, by the sight of these monuments of the old religion, that Jeroboam refrained from setting up his golden calves in the vicinity. Diss. ii. p. 119. H.  
**27** *It hath heard.* This is a figure of speech, by which sensation is attributed to inanimate things; and they are called upon, as it were, to bear witness in favour of the great Creator, whom they on their part constantly obey, ( Ch). which is the best manner of hearing. They rise up to our confusion. Theod. q. 19. W.—The oriental writers delight in these strong figurative expressions, which are not confined to poetry. Jesus Christ says, that if the children were silent, *the stones would cry out.* Luc. 19:40. See Num. 13:33. Gen. 4:10. C.—*Lest.* Heb. “it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest you deny your God;” or literally, “lie unto your Elohim.” H.—The expression often means to revolt and prove faithless. Deut. 33:29. &c.  
**29** *And after*, &c. If Josue wrote this book, as is commonly believed, these last verses were added by Samuel, or some other prophet. Ch.—Scholastic History. W.—Josue had governed Israel 17 years with the greatest prudence and fidelity. C.—Some extend his administration to a longer period. H.—He paid the debt of nature probably not long after the ratification of the covenant. It does not appear that he was ever married. S. Jerom, c. Jov. 1. St Chrys.—The Scripture does not mention that the people mourned for him, as they had done for Moses, &c. Yet we cannot doubt but they would shew this mark of respect to his memory, on account of the many benefits which they had received from him. The Holy Ghost has vouchsafed to be his panegyrist. Num. 27:12. Eccli. 46:1. &c. Josephus (v. 1,) represents him as a most universal character, equally perfect in everything that he took in hand. His greatest honour is to have been so striking a figure of Jesus, whose name he bore, ( C.) and whose sacred office in administering a second circumcision after he had caused the people to cross the Jordan, he so well described. Like him he introduces the faithful into the land of promise, overthrows their enemies, and establishes them in peace, taking care both at the beginning and at the end of his administration, to set before their eyes the will of the heavenly Father, the God who is both holy and jealous, v. 19. Under Josue the Israelites are invincible, only as long as they continue faithful. C. 7. But Jesus secures his Church both from infidelity and from the attacks of all her enemies, by his all-powerful grace. H.—The Jews have attributed to Josue ten regulations, which are too trifling to have been made by him. Seld. Jur. vi. 2.—The Samaritan chronicle embellishes the account of this great man with many surprising and puerile fictions, as if the true history were not sufficient to excite our attention. See Basnage and Serarius. C.—The Jews say Josue died on the 26th of Nisan, unmarried. The Roman martyrology honours his memory on the 1st of Sept. Salien, A.C. 1453. It is probable that the Egyptian or Tyrean Hercules, who encountered so many giants and difficulties, was no other than Josue, whose history the pagans have obscured with fables. Vossius. H.  
**30** *Thamnathsare* *.* Judg. 2:9. The last word is written *hares* (*eros*) the first and last letters being transposed in one of these places. It may probably be in this verse, as we read of Mount *Hares*, Jud. 1:35. Kennicott rather thinks that Sare is the proper reading, as it is found in the Syr. Arab. and Vulg. versions of the Book of Judges. He observes, that if we were to read in an English historian that the renowned Marlborough was buried at *Ble* *nheim*, near Woodstock, and a few pages after that his remains were interred “at *Blenmein*, &c. we should naturally conclude that two letters had exchanged their places. And may we not allow the same in this part of the sacred history, as it is universally printed” in Hebrew? Dis. i. Some, however, maintain that *Thamnath hares* was so called, on account of “the image of the sun” being placed in the tomb of Josue, along with the knives of stone used by him in circumcision, which last the Sept. and S. Aug. (q. 30,) admit. But these must be reckoned among the Jewish or Oriental fables, ( C.) though it is not improbable but the circumcising knives might be thus preserved, as a monument of the covenant made with the Israelites. H.—*Gaas.* This was another name for Mount Sare, or Hares, a part of Mount Ephraim; where S. Jerom tells us S. Paula visited the tomb of Josue. It was shewn near Thamna in the days of Eusebius. C.—No mention is made of mourning, as for Moses, &c. to insinuate that under the law the saints descended into limbo, but are admitted into paradise under the gospel. S. Jer. mans. 34. W.  
**31** *Long time;* perhaps fifteen years. These ancients kept the people in order by their authority ( C.) and good example, so great an influence have the manners of superiors upon those of the subjects. M.—*Regis ad exemplar totus componitur orbis* *.* See 2 Par. 24:2. 16. After the death of these virtuous rulers, who had been formed in the school of Moses and of Josue, and had beheld the wonders of God, ( H.) the people began to embrace the worship of *Baalim.* Judg. 2:11.  
**32** *Sichem*. Joseph had charged his brethren to take his bones with them. Gen. 50:24. Ex. 13:19. Masius supposes that they were solemnly interred after the altar was erected near Sichem, and the covenant ratified, when all the people were together. Others think that they deferred doing this till the country was conquered and divided. Josue would lose no time unnecessarily in performing these last rites to the revered patriarch.—*Field.* Jacob had given this field to his son. He had first purchased it; (Gen. 33:19,) and when the Amorrhite had taken possession again, after the unhappy affair at Sichem, he recovered it by the sword. Gen. 48:22.—*Ewes.* Heb. Kesita may denote also some species of money, though not perhaps marked with any figure of a lamb, &c. C.—Prot. “pieces of silver.” H.—The mausoleum of Joseph at Sichem, was to be seen in S. Jerom’s time. q. Heb. in Gen. W.  
**33** *Eleazar*, the second high priest, was succeeded by his son *Phinees* *.* They were both of a very unexceptionable character. The Holy Ghost says, (Eccli. 45:28,) *Phinees, the son of Eleazar, is the third in glory, by imitating him* (his father or grandfather) *in the fear of the Lord*, &c. The Jews seem to have adopted the doctrine of Pythagoras, with respect to Phinees, ( H.) as they say that he was the man of God, (3 K. 2:27,) who appeared to Heli, (Trad. Heb. in Reg.) and that he was consulted by Jephte, and gave him advice to fulfil his vow; that he was the same person with Elias, and with one Phinees, who returned from the captivity with Esdras. 1 Par. 9:20. They will even have him to be an incarnate angel. Ap. Munster, &c. But without dwelling any longer on these fabulous accounts, ( C.) he was surely a man of the greatest zeal and piety. H.—In consideration of his extraordinary merit, the city of Gabaath was given to him, though it was not properly a sacerdotal city, and priests could not regularly possess any land as their inheritance. Grotius supposes that he obtained this city along with his wife, as she was an heiress of the tribe of Ephraim. But if that had been the case, must she not have married some of the same tribe? Num. 36:8. C.—Sept. (Grabe) add, “In that day the children of Israel taking the ark of the covenant of God, carried it about among themselves, and Phinees was priest instead of his father, till he died, and he was buried in Gabaath, his own city. But the Israelites went each to his own place and city; and the children of Israel worshipped Astarte and Asteroth, and the gods of the surrounding nations, and the Lord delivered them into the hands of Eglon, the king of Moab, and he held them in subjection 18 years. See Judg. 3:12. 14. Why this is recorded in this place does not appear, unless it be to insinuate that the servitude under Eglon did not commence till after the death of Phinees, who had been high priest 40 years. Abisue, his son, entered upon the pontificate in the first year of the administration of Aod. 1 Par. 6:4. 50. Salien, A.M. 2641, A.C. 1412. Josue and Eleazar had reigned nearly during the same period of time, and finished their course together. They had assisted each other in keeping the people of God under due restraint. Their successors in office acted with the like zeal and concord, though they were not quite so successful. It is probable that Phinees would have the chief sway in “the aristocracy” of the *ancients*, which Josephus says took place between Josue and Othoniel. Their government is acknowledged by most authors, though Salien supposes that their authority, as distinct from the Sanhedrim, consisted in giving good example. Many assert that Phinees ruled the people twenty-three years. H.
