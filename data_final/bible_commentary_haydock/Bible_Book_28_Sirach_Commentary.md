# Sirach Commentary

This book is so called from the Greek word that signifies *a preacher:* because, like an excellent preacher, it gives admirable lessons of all virtues. The author was Jesus, the son of Sirach, of Jerusalem, who flourished about two hundred years before Christ. As it was written after the time of Esdras, it is not in the Jewish canon; but is received as canonical and divine by the Catholic Church, instructed by apostolical tradition, and directed by the Spirit of God. It was first written in Hebrew, but afterwards translated into Greek by another Jesus, the grandson of the author, whose prologue to this book is the following: Ch.

—If some forbear to urge the authority of this book, in disputes with the Jews, we need not be surprised, as there were other proofs against them. We often act with Prot. in the same manner, even using their versions, &c. H.—It was alleged in the controversies about baptism and grace, and no one thought of rejecting its testimony. C. 34:30. S. Cyp. ep. 65. S. Aug. Bap. vi. 34. Grat. ii. 11. &c.—The Councils of Ephesus, 3d Carthage, (c. 47.) Francfort, 8th Toledo, and Trent, ought to settle all doubts on this head. The Jews themselves have a great regard for the book, (though the Thalmud condemns it for admitting more persons than one in God) and seem to have copied many sentences from it into the two Syriac alphabets of Ben Sira. This may be the work which S. Jerom (Pref. in Sal.) testifies he saw in Heb. as that test cannot at present be found. C.—See ep. 115. D.—But this is no proof that it was not extant in S. Jerom’s time, and the many variations between the Greek copies themselves and the Vulg. may owe their rise to the different translators omitting some parts of it. H.—The same person seems to have translated this and the former book into Latin in the earliest ages, though the present work is more obscure, because the Greek is less beautiful, of which the Rom. edit. is deemed the most correct; though the Compl. agrees with the Vulg. He appears to have given frequently a double version, for fear of not having expressed the full sense in the first, unless the additions be his, or some other person’s *glosses*, which have crept into the text. C.—If this be the case, near one hundred verses ought to be cut off, yet as they are published without any distinction by the Church, perhaps it would be as well to adhere to the former sentiment, or to suspend our judgment. C. 9:12. H.—Many of the Fathers quote this book as the production of Solomon, because it contains many of his sentences preserved by tradition, ( M.) and resembles his works. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. xvii. 20.—The Greek styles it “The Wisdom of Jesus, the son of Sirach.” He has imitated ( H.) the *Proverbs* to c. 24. *Ecclesiastes* to c. 42:15 where wisdom ends her exhortation, and the *Canticle* in the remainder of the work, praising God and the great men of the nation, down to Simon II. Vales. in Euseb. iv. 22. C.—The last chapter contains a *prayer*, which may be in imitation of the book of *Wisdom.* This work is often styled *Panaretos*, a collection of pious maxims, ( H.) or a “receptacle of all virtues.” W.—Many think it was composed between A.M. 3711. and 3783; (Torniel.) but it seem rather to have appeared in times of persecution, (c. 36) after Philopator had been incensed against Simon II. for opposing his entrance into the sanctuary, (c. 50:4. &c.) for which he ordered the Jews in Egypt to be cruelly butchered, (2 Mac.) and after Epiphanes, the Syrian monarch, had commenced his most cruel persecution of that people, and of Onias III. twenty-two years after the death of Simon II. (c. 35 and 50) A.M. 3828. B.C. 176. Euseb. Grot. Usher. C.

## Chapter 1

**1** *Wisdom.* In this book, Wisdom is taken for the Deity, the Son, or the gift communicated to men. Prov. 3:19. Wisd. 7:25. C.  
**3** *God.* This is eternal and unsearchable, more than the *sand of the sea*, &c. Is. 40:12. H.—Man cannot comprehend God’s works. W.  
**4** *Created.* Or “generated,” if it be understood of the Son. S. Athan. Bos.—The wisdom which is given to man, was in God before the creation. Prov. 8:22. C.—The decree regarding the incarnation was from eternity. M.  
**5** *Commandments.* The wise will observe the law (Deut. 4:6. H.) and the Scriptures. This verse is not in the Gr. of Rome, &c. but it is in the edit. of Complut. and Camerarius.  
**9** *In the Holy Ghost*, or from himself. See Wisd. 1:5 and 7:22. Gr. omits these words. C.  
**11** *Joy.* Eternal glory is the fruit of the fear of the Lord; not that this virtue sufficeth, but it is the beginning, grounded on true faith, and bringeth forth other virtues, and fruits of the Holy Ghost, and a joyful crown in the end. W.—The virtuous enjoy or deserve honour. C.  
**16** *Womb.* Grace has prevented them. H.—They are free from evil dispositions. Wisd. 8:19. Job 31:18.—*Women; feminis*, or rather *seminis* *.* C.—Gr. “it shall be intrusted to their *seed.*” H.—“His mercy is fixed with their seed.” Syr. M.—This includes both men and women.  
**17** *Religiousness*, or proper application of knowledge. H.—A learned impious man is most dangerous. This and the two next verses are not in Greek.  
**27** *Sin*, by vigilance or by repentance.  
**29** *To him*, as may be seen in the lives of the patriarchs.  
**32** *Sinner.* Such imagine that God’s service is insupportable. W.  
**35** *Faith*, or fidelity. M.—The meek shall possess the land. Matt. 5:4. C.  
**39** *Down.* Pride is usually thus treated. Matt. 23:12. C.  

---

## Chapter 2

**1** *God.* All must be tried. Tob. 12:13. Heb. 12:6. Lu. 24:46. But God will grant sufficient grace. 1 Cor. 10:13. C.  
**2** *Humble.* Gr. “regulate thy heart, and endure, and make not haste in the time of trouble,” ( H.) inflicted by God. Grot.—But not impatient. Is. 28:16.—*Clouds.* Lit. “overcast,” *obductionis* *.* H.—Desire not death, in order to be covered from the miseries of life; for that would ( W.) border on despair. H.  
**3** *Patience.* Or expectation of being relieved. M.  
**5** *Humiliation.* It shews what they really are. C.  
**10** *Enlightened.* With joy. Is. 58. M.—This verse is not in Greek. To avoid such frequent repetitions, it would be well to mark the passage in different characters, ( H.) or between crotchets, as in the French version. C.—Yet the Greek editions are not uniform. See Drusius and Hæschel.  
**14** *Ways.* Attempting to reconcile the service of the world with that of God, who rejects hypocrites, ( H.) the inconstant, and *faint-hearted.* v. 15 and 3 K. 18:21. C.—Virtues and sins will receive their due. W.  
**20** *Hearts.* With God’s grace ( H.) to fight manfully. C.—*Sanctify.* Greek, “humble their souls, saying, we shall,” &c. v. 22. H.—Prayer, vigilance, and humility are the best dispositions to resist the devil.  
**22** *Men.* He alludes to 2 K. 24:14. In this world, God punishes with mercy; in the next, with severity. Dan. 13:23. C.  

---

## Chapter 3

**1** *Love.* The progeny of God’s children brings forth the fruits of obedience and love. W.—Wisdom teaches every virtue. C.—This verse is not in Greek.  
**3** *Seeking.* Greek, “and hath confirmed the judgment,” &c. H.—God will revenge any disrespect shewn to parents. M.  
**7** *Father.* Greek, “Lord … mother (8) and will serve them,” &c. H.—Though you may feed your parents, you are still much in their debt. S. Amb. in Lu. 2. and 18. Ex. 20:12. Job 4:3.  
**9** *Father.* Greek adds, “and thy mother.” C.—Grabe marks this in another character, and substitutes “them” for *him.* v. 10.—*And his*, &c. is wholly omitted. H.  
**11** *Foundations.* S. Aug. (de Civ. Dei. xxii. 8.) gives a memorable instance. The pagans deemed such curses most terrible. Orpheus. Gen. 9:25.—They are executed upon the wicked.  
**12** *Thee.* Boast not of thy superior talents, nor say any thing disrespectful.  
**13** *A father.* Greek, “mother.” Alexander was ashamed of having Philip for his father, pretending that he was the son of Jupiter Ammon. His mother Olympias, with much ingenuity, wrote to him, that he would thus make Juno her powerful rival!  
**15** *Fail.* *Bis pueri senes* *.* They do not lose the character of fathers, how infirm soever, ( C.) and those can never truly serve the invisible Deity, who despise their fathers, his visible images on the earth. Philo. Decal.  
**16** *Sin.* Or ill-nature. Greek, “instead of sins, (17) a house shall be built up for thee.” H.—Thy family shall increase. Ex. 1:21. C.—Alms, prayer, and sacrifice for parents merit reward. W.  
**18** *Of.* Greek, “Like a blasphemer is,” &c. C.—He who reviles his father, meditates blasphemy against the Deity. Menander.  
**19** *Meekness.* Here a new subject begins. Goodness begets love. S. Amb. Off. ii. 7.  
**20** *Greater* *.* The dignity of a person should be the measure of his humility, (S. Amb. de virg. 31.) as the most elevated are the most exposed to pride. Humility is taught only by true wisdom and the gospel. Matt. 11:29. Philosophy may inspire us with the contempt of riches, &c. C.—Yet humility is the most indispensable duty, and no less essential than *delivery* to an orator. S. Aug. ep. 118. ad Diosc.—All human greatness comes from God, who requires us to shew our gratitude by humility. W.  
**22** *In*, &c. The mysterious nature of God and providence, cannot be comprehended: and in many things we must confess our ignorance. Life is often spent in idle researches.  
**26** *Suspicion.* Gr. Comp. “their vain suspicion hath deceived many and *their* wicked thought has ruined their judgment. Not having the apples of the eye, thou wilt be deprived of light; and being ignorant, do not speak.” The latter sentence is marked by Grabe as wanting in his copy, as it is in the Vat. if we may believe the London edit. ( H.) which, however, is not an exact copy, no more than any of the other editions, of that famous MS. Grabe.  
**27** *Heart.* Which fears neither God nor man. S. Bern. cons. 1.—Those who have not shewn mercy, can expect none. H.—The impenitent see their folly, like Antiochus, when it is too late. C.—They have loved the *danger*, which shall overtake them. Prov. 1:26. He seems to refute those who believed in fate, and would take no precautions. C.—Those who live in sin, tempting God to the last hour, generally perish. W.  
**29** *Wicked.* Greek, “hard,” obdurate in sin, like Pharao. Rom. 2:5. H.—*S* *orrows.* Or crimes, as the word often implies, and the punishment thereof. C.—“Sin, by its own weight, leads to another, (S. Greg. Mor. xxv. 12.) and while custom is not resisted, a necessity arises.” S. Aug. Conf. viii. 5.  
**30** *Congregation.* The proud or obstinate sinner will take no advice. Prov. 18:3. C.  
**31** *Understand.* Greek, “shall devise a parable, and the ear of the hearer is the desire of a wise man.” H.  
**33** *Water*, &c. He delights to instruct the attentive. C.—*Resist.* Greek, “shall expiate, *or* obtain pardon for sins.” Dan. 4:24 and Lu. 11:41. “Alms-deeds are a sort of baptism, which may be often repeated” to advantage. S. Amb. or. Max.—“When we bestow any thing, it is not of our own, but the gift of Christ. We give bread … He, *the poor*, renders us the kingdom of heaven.” S. Jerom in Ps. cxxxiii. God becomes our debtor. S. Chrys. hom. liii. and lviii.—Our inheritance is secured. S. Cyp. de Op.—But then charity and repentance must accompany our alms. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. 21. ult.  

---

## Chapter 4

**1** *Alms.* Gr. “life,” and of what is necessary to support it. *Si non pavisti, occidisti* *.* S. Tho. (ii. 2. q. xxxii. 5.) quoting the offices of S. Amb. though the sentence is not to be found there. C.—Christians are not master of what is superfluous, no more than those who have the goods of the Church. S. Chrys. Corn. a Lap.—*Turn.* Gr. “draw not after thee indigent eyes.” H.—Make not the poor wait, long for relief. 2 Cor. 9:7. Rom. 12:8. Prov. 8:28. C.—*Qui tarde dat, diu noluit* *.* Sen. Ben. i. 1.—*Fames et mora bilem in nasum concitant* *.* Plaut.  
**5** *For … anger*, and *behind*, &c. is not in Gr. H.—He thrice repeats the same injunction. Ex. 22:22. C.—Deal not cruelly with the poor; for God will revenge their injuries. W.  
**7** *Of the.* Gr. “and bow,” &c. H.—Submission to magistrates is enforced. C.  
**8** *And … owest*, is not in Gr. H.—People in office must attend to all. C.  
**15** *One.* Or “sanctuary.” They shall be honoured like priests. Is. 61:6. *Birth*, rather than merit, gave a title to the Jewish priests; but those who are wise shall minister in a more glorious temple. C.  
**18** *In temptation*, &c. The meaning is, that before wisdom will choose any for her favourites, she will try them by leading them through contradictions, afflictions, and temptations, the usual noviceship of the children of God. Ch.—Gr. “for sideways *or* through crooked paths she shall walk with him at first, (19) she,” &c. H.—The narrow path leads to heaven, (Matt. 7:13) and to virtue. Hesiod.  
**21** *To him.* And explain why she has treated him so roughly.  
**22** *Enemy.* Gr. “ruin.” This road leads to eternal misery. H.  
**23** *Time.* For all things. Eccl. 3:1. All depends on the proper season.  
**24** *Ashamed*, to ask for relief, (v. 25. C.) or *to say the truth*, as the martyrs have done. This is not in Greek.  
**25** *Sin.* Thus to refuse asking for what is necessary to support life, would be criminal.—*Grace.* When we refrain from doing things truly shameful. C. 41. C.—To abhor sin is glorious; but to yield to it, through shamefacedness, or not to reprove it, is vicious. W.  
**27** *Fall.* Excuse not his faults, ( C.) lest thou partake in them.  
**28** *Hide*, &c. is not in the Alex. copy, though inserted by Grabe. H.—Ostentation is blameable; still we must in defence of the truth. C.  
**29** *Tongue.* Gr. “by speech, wisdom shall be known, and instruction by the word of the tongue.”  
**30** *Lie.* Gr. “of thy want of information.” Yet Grabe and the Comp. edit. have *lie*, &c. H.—Always yield to the truth, ( C.) and never tell a lie, but speak the truth at proper times. W.  
**32** *River.* Useless resistance is to be avoided; and when it is requisite to oppose the demands of the great, we must do it with reserve. v. 33. C.  
**33** *Strive.* Gr. “unto death strive for the truth, and the Lord God will fight for thee.” H.—The saints were modest, but intrepid. C.—All must rather lose their lives than act against justice or truth. W.  
**34** *Works.* Perform what thou hast promised.

## Chapter 5

**1** *Unjust.* The translator styles riches unjust, because they often proceed from, or tend to injustice. They can afford no protection in death. Ps. 48:17. Lu. 11:19 and 16:9. C.  
**2** **V** **er.** **2** **.** *Heart.* If no man can oppose thee, remember God’s judgments. W.  
**3** *How mighty am I?* is not in Gr. though read by S. Cyp. and S. Aug. Spec.—Sennacherib’s vain boasting was soon punished. Is. 37:36. C.  
**4** *Rewarder.* Gr. “is long-suffering, he will not let thee escape.”  
**5** *And add.* Gr. “to add.” Take not occasion from God’s goodness to offend him. H.—He will punish at last. Jans.—Though you may have taken pains to repent, are you assured of being forgiven? Eccle. 9:1. A relapse calls for greater severity, though the graces of God are *without repentance.* Rom. 11:29. He does not recall his favours, but he hates the ungrateful, v. 6. Bell. Just. iii. 4. C.—Satisfaction must be made even after the sin has been remitted. W.—This may be feared. M.  
**7** *Looketh.* Gr. “shall rest” in hell, to punish the abuse of mercy. H.  
**8** *Day.* A rabbin being asked when one must repent? answered, the day before death. But we know not when that will take place! Then, replied he, we must repent to-day. Drus.—“God has promised thee pardon, if thou repent, but he has not promised thee to-morrow.” S. Aug. Ps. cxiv.  
**12** *The way.* Greek, “thy knowledge *or* sentiment, and let thy speech be one,” ( H.) that men may depend upon thee.  
**13** *Word.* Comp. adds, “of God.” But the Rom. edit. has, “be quick to hear, and answer slowly.” Jam. 1:19. “It is safer to hear than to preach.” S. Aug. lix. in Jo.—Constancy in virtue will obtain the promised *peace.* W.  
**14** *Lest.* Gr. “honour and infamy is in speech; and the tongue of man proves his ruin.” H.—Nothing can be productive of better or of worse consequences. Prov. 18:21. C.  
**16** *Be.* Gr. “ensnare not by thy tongue, (17) for evil confusion is upon the thief, and great condemnation on the double-tongued. 18.) Be not ignorant in any thing, great or small.” H.—The detractor is more dangerous than the thief. He pierces without being seen. Eccle. 10:11. Prov. 26:20. Rom. 1:29.  
**18** *Great.* Only examine the justice of the cause; or, according to the Greek, commit no fault of ignorance, nor say, “I did not think.” C.—Acknowledge thy friend in his poverty, as well as in his greatness. H.  

---

## Chapter 6

**1** *Instead.* Gr. “and instead,” &c. Syriac begins this chapter with the preceding verse, with which this is connected. Detraction will separate friends.  
**2** *Extol.* This conduct is inimical to true friendship, which requires that we should make allowance for one another’s faults. C.—*Like.* Gr. “lest thy soul be torn away like a bull. Thou wilt eat,” &c. H.—Vulg. is better. C.  
**3** *Wilderness.* Thus was Nabuchodonosor humbled. Dan. 4. M.  
**5** *Appeaseth* *.* Gr. “and an eloquent tongue multiplies good words.” H.—The affable gain our affections. Gideon pacified the incensed Ephraimites by a mild answer. Jud. 8. W.  
**6** *Counsellor.* Only few are capable of this office, ( H.) or of keeping a secret. Yet we must *have peace, if possible, with all.* Rom. 12:18. C.—The Scythians condemned many friends, no less than many wives, (Luc. Tox.) and Aristotle (Eth. 9:10) commends this maxim of Hesiod: μητε πολυξεινος μητ αζεινος; “neither to have too many guests, *or* intimate friends, nor to be without any.”  
**7** *Get.* Lit. “dost possess a friend, possess him in trial,” ( H.) as the Greek also has it. But the Heb. term kanah, means likewise, “to acquire,” and a friend ought to be chosen with judgment. It is too late to try him after he has been received. C.—One must try much before a companion be chosen, that he may be afterwards preserved. Plut.—“Possess not friends quickly, but those whom thou hast obtained, reject not with disgrace.” Solon. Laert. i. and ii. 8.  
**8** *Trouble.* Such are interested friends; but true friendship is a kind and perfect agreement in all divine and human affairs.” Cic. S. Aug. c. Acad. iii.—Religion must be the foundation.  
**9** *Reproaches.* Disclosing all your imperfections. C.—“The closest alliances, being broken, produce the most bitter enmities.” Pliny, xxxvii. 4.  
**12** *Humble.* “Friends must have a respect for each other.” Cic.  
**13** *Friends.* Such as have been just described. Of these the maxim of Bias may be true, that people should “love as if they were to hate,” at some future period. Laert. i.—Entire confidence becomes those who are friends indeed.  
**14** *Defence.* Jonathas and Chusai saved David.  
**16** *An* *d immortality*, is not in Greek. C.—But shews the meaning of *life* is this place; as a true friend will not cease to give good advice for eternity. H.—But even in this world, nothing can be more advantageous. C.—*Amicus magis necessarius est quam ignis et aqua* *.* Cic. S. Amb. off iii.—*Him.* Cicero himself says, “friendship can subsist only among the virtuous.” Yet these, judging others by themselves, are more easily imposed upon, and ought, therefore, to address themselves to God. C.  
**17** *Be.* He will instill into his friend sentiments of piety, if he have them not before. *Amicitia similes inveni* *t aut facit* *.* “Pythagoras desires that in friendship one should be formed of many.” Cic. v. 11. H.  
**18** *Wisdom.* A good education will, at last, bring forth fruit, though the passions may choke the good seed for a time. C.—“Take wisdom for the provision on thy journey, from youth to old age.” Bias. Laert. i.  
**22** *Trial.* Such stones were used to try people’s strength, (Zach. 12:3. C.) or to try gold. Vat.—The Syriac explains it of a precious stone. But the first idea is preferable. Many will not so much as attempt to become acquainted with wisdom and piety.  
**23** *Name.* Perhaps the author may compare the Greek word Sophia, ( C.) with Tsopuie, ( H.) “hidden,” or with the Greek term, zophos, which means “darkness.” See c. 43:8 and 46:1. The original Heb. test is lost, so that we cannot determine to what word allusion is made. See Corn. a Lapide, who has written the best commentary on this book.—*But*, &c. is not in Greek. C.—Many prefer learning before piety. But S. Aug. says, the unlearned rise and take the kingdom of heaven, while we with our learning, devoid of heart, (or charity. H.) behold we fall into the dirt. Conf. viii. 8. W.  
**28** *Thee.* She will even seek thee first. Wisd. 6:14. Prov. 8. Matt. 7:7.—*Gotten. Continence* does not here signify being chaste, ( C.) though this is one of the fruits of wisdom. Wisd. 8:21. Gal. 5:23. H.  
**30** *Firm.* Lit. “bases of virtue;” ( H.) which is not in Gr. and rather embarrasses the sentence; ( C.) though it may signify, that if we serve the Lord with fidelity, our building will never be overturned. H.  
**35** *Wise.* Lit. “prudent.” The Latin has this epithet, because old people are not always such, though it may be expected of them. C.—“While wisdom increases, all other faculties decrease.” S. Jer. ad Nepot.  
**36** *Mornin* *g*, with the utmost diligence. C.—“The very meeting of the wise is of advantage; and thou mayst learn something of a great man, though he open not his mouth.” Sen. ep. xciv.  

---

## Chapter 7

**2** *Evils.* Gr. “injustice.” Evil communications corrupt good manners, ( H.) or the punishment of sin follows it commission. C.  
**3** *Not.* Gr. “not in.” H.—*Seven-fold:* more abundantly. Osee 10:11. Job 4:5. Gal. 6:7. C.—The wicked shall receive the fruit of their wickedness. W.  
**4** *Honour.* Ambition is the source of ruin to men and empires. Jam. 3:1. C.  
**5** *God.* Gr. “the Lord, and affect not wisdom (σοφιζου) before the king.” H.—Of ourselves we are despicable; and kings love not those whose superior talents seem to eclipse their own. David’s valour excited the hatred of Saul, and Alexander “was indignant that Antipater (his general, H.) had conquered, thinking his own glory was diminished by that which another acquired.” Curt. 6.  
**6** *Integrity.* A judge is expose to many dangers. 2 Par. 19:6. C.—“He must be prudent and firm.” Plato, 2 Rep.—What will become of those who push themselves forward? S. Chrys. hom. xxxiv. in Heb. 13.  
**8** *To sin.* Correct not thy severity by too great indulgence, nor entangle thyself with the sins of othres, as with a chain. Is. 5:18.  
**9** *Mind.* If thou hast committed a fault, despair not, but pray, (v. 10) avoiding presumption. v. 14.  
**12** *Soul.* Whether the person have incurred a fault or not, we ought to shew pity, reflecting on our own frailty. 1 Cor. 10:12.  
**13** *Devise* *.* Lit. “plough.” But Heb. Charasch, means also to machinate.—*Brother.* We cannot hence infer, with Grotius, that the Jews allowed themselves to deceive strangers. C.  
**14** *Good*, but very pernicious, (Mat. 5:37. Apoc. 21:8. S. Aug. Mend.) though some have thought that lies might be told to prevent evil. Orig. &c. C.  
**15** *Repeat not.* Make not much babbling by repetition of words, but aim more at fervour of heart. Ch.—A supplication ought to be drawn up in a concise manner. H.—Judges and orators should speak with due reserve. Prayer must be unceasing: yet many words must not be used to *inform* God of our wants. Our Saviour seems to allude to this text. Mat. 6:7.  
**16** *High.* Gen. 2:15 and 3:18. The patriarchs and the most famous Roman generals followed this employment.  
**19** *On the flesh*, is not in Greek. Christ appears to have had this passage in view, Mark 9:44. Many suppose that both allude to the fire which burnt dead bodies, &c. in the vale of Hinnon. But all allow that the inextinguishable flames of hell are meant. Whether the fire and worms be corporeal or not has been questioned: the Greek Fathers, and the Church of Florence, generally maintain the negative, and the Latins assert it on better grounds. S. Thomas adopts the opinion of many of the Fathers, who explain the worm to denote the remorse of conscience. Yet many take it to be a *worm*, though not like those with which we are acquainted. *Horreo* *vermem mendacem et mortem vivacem* *.* S. Bern. cons. v. See S. Jer. Is. lxvi. A. Lap. S. Greg. Dial. iv. 29. S. Aug. De C. xx. 10. S. Amb. vii. in Lu. xiv. C.—Fire and the worm of conscience are both eternal. W.—The punishment at least is such, and more intense than we can conceive.  
**21** *Wife.* The virtuous never approved of divorcing any but the incorrigible. C. Dis.  
**27** *Man.* The Jews in general embraced the married state in their youth. S. Paul prefers virginity. 1 Cor. 7:8.  
**28** *Hateful.* To marry such a cone would be an occasion of divorce, which is always odious.  
**29** *Groaning* *s*, in child-bed, and ( C.) during thy infancy. M. Job 4:4.  
**33** *Priests.* Gr. “priest, and give him the portion which is enjoined thee, the first-fruit, and for negligence, and the gift of the shoulders, and the,” &c. v. 35. H.—*Arms.* That is, with all thy power: or else by *arms* (*brachiis*) are here signified the *right shoulders* of the victims, which by the law fell to the share of the priests. See v. 35. ( Ch.) Ex. 29:28. Lev. 7:22.  
**34** *Few* offerings, if thou be poor. Sa.—Be alone with the priest when thou dost confess, and imitate the small number.  
**36** *Poor.* They and Levites are always to be invited. Deut. 12:19 and 14:26.  
**37** *Dead:* detained in purgatory. W.—*And restrain not grace from the dead.* Withhold not from them the benefit of alms, prayers, and sacrifices. Such was the doctrine and practice of the Church of God, even in the time of the Old Testament. And the same has always been continued from the days of the apostles in the Church of the New Testament. Ch.—Meat was also placed on the tombs of the deceased, for the benefit of the poor. Tob. 4:18. S. Aug. Conf. vi. 2.  
**38** *Walk.* Gr. “mourn.” H.—It was customary to join those who mourned for the dead, and to offer them meat, and endeavour to comfort them. C. Diss.  
**39** *Love*, being approved both by God and man.  
**40** *End.* Gr. “things;” death, judgment, and either hell or heaven. H.—This consideration is a powerful preservative against sin. W.—For who would dare to offend his judge, if he believed that the next moment he would be arraigned before his dreadful tribunal? C.—“We die daily,” &c. S. Jer. ad Heliod.

## Chapter 8

**2** *Bring.* Gr. “overweigh thee,” ( H.) or turn the balance of the judge ( C.) against thee, by money, ( H.) which sometimes will corrupt *kings.* It is better, therefore, to avoid all law-suits. W.  
**4** *Fire.* v. 13. Prov. 26:20. Such contests are full of danger.  
**5** *Family.* Or “ancestors.” They will be accused of having neglected thy education. People generally associate with those of the like dispositions.  
**13** *Sinners.* Gr. “a sinner, lest thou be burnt in the fire of his flame, when he shall be enraged. H.—This is not the time for reprehension. C.—The envoys of Ezechias prudently answered nothing to Rabsaces. S. Jer. in Is. xxxvi.—Useless correction must be avoided. M.  
**14** *Words.* Thus the Pharisees attacked our Saviour. Matt. 22:15. In popular assemblies it is dangerous, but sometimes requisite to oppose bold declaimers. C. 9:25.  
**16** *Power.* Thou must consider the debt as thy own. Prov. 6:1. C.  
**20** *Love.* Gr. “keep the word secret. 21) Do no hidden thing before a stranger.” H.—The skilful alone must be consulted. W.  
**22** *Evil.* Gr. “false kindness.” The rest is omitted. H.—Samson was undone by Dalilia. When Pompey was going on an embassy, he was taken by king Gentius, who wished to extort his secret from him; but he put his finger in the flame of a candle, that he might see that all his attempts would be fruitless. V. Max. iii. 3.

## Chapter 9

**1** *Lest.* “A husband should teach his wife to be chaste by his own example.” Lact. Relig. vi.  
**4** *Dancer.* Gr. “musician, lest,” &c. H.—The same person is often given to both music and dancing, ( M.) and these arts are very dangerous. Met. 14:6.—The dances in the East were more licentious than ours.  
**5** *Gaze.* It is not always possible to avoid seeing them; but the greatest caution is requisite. Job 32:1. Mat. 5:28. C.—Jealousy and all dangerous occasions must be avoided. W.  
**7** *S* *treets.* Gr. “retired parts,” where bad women dwell. C.  
**8** *Up.* Gr. “of a fine appearance.” Grabe substitutes, “who has found favour.” H.—The Fathers condemn too much dressing as a mark of levity and incontinence.  
**12** *Nor*, &c. is also admitted in many copies, though found in the Comp. and Ald edit. C.—Grabe replaces it on the authority of Clem. (Pæd. ii. 7.) as he does many other passages, which are erroneously left out in several editions. Prolog. t. 4. c. 3. It would therefore be injurious to the word of God, if we were always to reject the additions in the Vulg. which are not in the Vat. Gr. copy; and they must not all at least be considered as interpolations.  
**16** *Envy not.* If thou hast faith and wisdom, thou wilt rather dread his punishment. Ps. 36:1 and Prov. 3:31. C.—He is like a summer flower, that is quickly cut down. W.  
**17** *Wrong.* Gr. “applauses of the unjust. Remember that they will not be justified even to hell.” H.—The world itself will finally approve only of virtue. C.—The wicked will be condemned both by God and man. H.  
**20** *It.* Gr. “Know what thou art … walking on the pinnacles of the city.” H.—The same sense is given in the Vulg. as people walking among armed men in a rage, are exposed to imminent danger. M.  
**21** *Beware.* Gr. “aim at.” Examine the person to whom thou intrusteth a secret.  
**24** *Artificers.* All strive to excel in their profession.  
**25** *Hateful.* Satirists are dangerous. C.—

## Chapter 10

**1** *Judge.* Gr. “instruct.” Ch.—The example of rulers is very powerful. W.  
**2** *Therein. Regis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis* *.* Claud.—As a whole city is infected with the vices of princes, so it may be corrected by their good behaviour, (*continentiâ* *.*) Cic. Leg. 3.  
**3** *Rulers.* All who wish to live under just kings. Prov. 29:4.  
**4** *It*, as he did David. Job 34:30. Dan. 2:20. C.  
**5** *The scribe.* That is, the man that is wise and learned in the law. Ch.—It also denotes an officer. Judg. 5:14. God must give light and success. C.  
**6** *Injury*, out of revenge. H. Lev. 19:18.—“Cæsar used to forget nothing but injuries.” Cic. Ligar.—This at least is the character of a great man. S. Aug. ep. 138. and 54.  
**7** *Men.* It invades the rights of the former, and disturbs the repose of mankind.—*All.* Gr. is obscure, “and from both proceeds injustice;” ( C.) or, “it shall act unjustly.” H.—Pride attacks both God and man. Grot.  
**8** *Deceits.* Hence kingdoms are changed. W.—The ambition and luxury of subjects (Cato) and the negligence of the rulers, bring on confusion. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. v. 13.  
**9** *Man.* The desire of plunder, or of glory, occasions revolutions. H.—Covetousness is the root of all evils, and causes people to abandon the faith. 1 Tim. 6:10. W.  
**10** *Bowels*, and would have no compassion for others or for himself. Some Gr. copies leave out as far as *sale*, but Grabe replaces the omission from the Comp.  
**14** *Beginning*, or summit; αρχη. C.—Thus Lucifer and Adam fell by pride. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. xii. 6. All sin, being a contempt of God, springs from pride, (Prosper. contemp. iii. 3.) and from an inordinate self-love. C.  
**15** *Sin*, because man abandons God’s law, and falls into all misery. W.—The proud easily yield to all sorts of iniquity. M.  
**16** *Disgraced.* Gr. “hath taken an exemplary vengeance, and hath,” &c. H.—*Them*, as he did the giants, Sodom, Nabuchodonosor, &c.  
**17** *Stead.* Lu. 1:52. C.—“Thales being asked what was difficult to be seen; replied, a tyrant grown old.” Laert. 1.  
**18** *Nations*, the Chanaanites, who submitted to the yoke: or rather the Hebrews. C.—Gr. “instead of them.”  
**19** *Foundat* *ion:* overturning Sodom, Babylon, and even Jerusalem, for their sins. C.  
**28** *Wise.* When Diogenes was exposed to sale, and asked what he could do, he answered, “I know how to command free men.” Laert. 6.—Joseph and Daniel obtained authority by their wise conduct. C.  
**31** *Desert.* Let not avarice deprive thee of the necessities of life, nor do any thing beneath thy dignity. Lu. 21:19.  
**33** *Glorified.* Gr. “honoured on account of his knowledge, and the rich is, “&c. H.  
**34** *And.* Greek omits this sentence: ( C.) yet Grabe has, And the man who is without honour in wealth, how much more so *will he be* in poverty? H. Eccle. 7:12.  

---

## Chapter 11

**1** *Men.* Merit is preferable to high birth, as it surmounts difficulties. C.—Those who humble themselves, like Daniel, or fall under the oppression of others unjustly, as Joseph did, shall be exalted by God. W.  
**2** *Look.* “The most robust is farthest removed from wisdom.” Cicero.—The beauty of the soul must be regarded. S. Amb. Virg. 3. C.  
**3** *Sweetness.* Honey was more esteemed before sugar became common. As the little bee produces such sweetness, so the less beautiful often by their abilities surpass the comely.  
**5** *Throne.* Gr. “pavement.” Dionysius II. tyrant of Syracuse, was forced to turn schoolmaster at Corinth. C.—*Crown.* Abdalonymus, a gardener, was placed on the throne of Sidon; (Curt. 4.) and several Roman emperors had been of the meanest condition. Pliny xxxv. 18. David was a shepherd.  
**6** *Others*, like Samson, Sedecias, Bajazet, &c.  
**7** **Ve** **r.** **7** **.** *Man*, as David did Miphiboseth. 2 K. 16:4. Constantine the Great grieved for having put his son Crispus to death on too weak evidence; and Theodosius repented for the sentence he had rashly passed on the inhabitants of Thessalonica. Even though the sentence should happen to be just, it would be wrong to pronounce it too hastily.  
**8** *Discourse.* This is a mark of impertinence. Prov. 18:13. C.—Let others finish their sentence, and wait if there be any elder or better informed to speak. W.  
**10** *Escape.* God will grant thee riches without so much solicitude (Lyran.) or rather meddle not with too many things, as that is the way to succeed in none, and destroys all repose.  
**16** *Sinners.* They are all born in sin. But some appear to have worse dispositions than others. Ps. 57:4. C.—God is not the author of iniquity. H.—He punishes in order to save, though he be offended by the wicked choice of man. C.—Blindness of heart and obduracy are punishments of sin. W.  
**17** *Ever.* All things work together for the good of the elect. Rom. 8:8. H.—God never abandons first. Trid. Ses. vii. 11.—The wicked often abuse graces. C.  
**21** *Covenant.* All the Israelites partook in covenants entered into between God and their fathers, which became their own by circumcision, as we become entitled to the alliance of Christ by baptism.  
**22** *Place.* If God bestow not riches, it may be for thy advantage.  
**24** *Fruit.* Prosperity was a sign of God’s favour, under the old law. Now nothing is more equivocal, and the *poor* are declared *blessed.* C.  
**26** *Myself.* Neither the poor nor the rich can be independent of God. H.—Perhaps no one does to hold this language. But many act as if they thought themselves gods, and some have claimed divine honours. 4 K. 18:34. Is. 14:13. Ezec. 29:3.  
**28** *Death*, in old age, (Grot.) or rather after the soul’s departure. The pagans had not this consolation. Their hopes were confined to the earth; and as they saw many honest people miserable, they introduced a chimerical idea of happiness, consisting in virtue alone. The views of Christians are chiefly bent on future rewards.  
**29** *Hour.* The last of life. It demonstrates the vanity of past pleasures. Even a momentary toothache will banish the recollection of such delights.  
**30** *Children.* If they take wicked ways, it is a stain on their father’s memory; and though the latter were blameless, it must greatly disturb their repose. C.—*Children* may here denote the *works* of man, which can only then be pronounced perfect, when he is incapable of falling from the state of virtue. H.  
**36** *Own.* So Herod destroyed his wife’s family, and Paris stole Helen. C.

## Chapter 12

**1** *To whom.* All must not be admitted into the house, nor treated with marks of particular esteem. Yet daily alms must be given without too scrupulous an enquiry. Lu. 6:30. C.—It would be wrong to encourage sinners, who would run to their ruin. But we must relieve the penitent. W.  
**2** *Lord.* Christ rewards what good is done to his poor brethren.  
**3** *For.* Gr. (4.) “Give to the pious, and receive not the sinner, (6.) Do,” &c. H.—The gospel enjoins us to *do good to all.* S. Aug. (Dort. iii. 16.) and S. Tho. (ii. 2. q. xxxii. a ix.) explain this in a spiritual sense, that we must not partake in the crimes of others. We may also make presents to the virtuous, and pass over people of a different character, particularly when they would abuse our gifts. The honest poor must be preserved.  
**10** *Rusteth* *.* So his malice always returns, ( C.) and he shews what he is. Vat.—Christianity does not blame due reserve in treating with those whom we know not, or who have formerly injured us. Though we must love them from our heart, yet we need not intrust our secrets to them, nor even to every friend. Joab always retained a hatred for Abner, and Absalom for his brother and father, though they dissembled their resentment. C.—So the wicked commonly act. H.—We must love, but not trust them, being *wise as serpents.* Matt. 10. W.  
**11** *Of him.* Gr. adds, “and thou shalt be to him as one who has rubbed a mirror, (of brass from the rust. It returns perpetually. C.) and shalt know that the rust is not removed for ever. Grabe. H.  
**13** *Beasts.* Vipers, &c. Why should they familiarize themselves with such? Some Italians still handle serpents without fear, pretending that they are the descendants of S. Paul. C.—But he was never married, (1 Cor. 7 H.) and they are rather of the race of the *Marsi*, who formerly claimed the same privilege, having made use of some drugs to prevent the poison. The ancients believed that they could *charm* serpents.  
**16** *Blood.* Jer. 41:6. Samson yielded to the tears of women. Judg. 14:16 and 16:6.  
**18** *Eyes.* Is taken from v. 16. It is not in Gr. H.—His tears are like those of *crocodiles*, which cry when they are going to kill a man. C.  

---

## Chapter 13

**1** *Pride.* We are naturally prone to it, and the friendship and manners of the proud will increase it. C.—If, therefore, the rich be not virtuous, it is dangerous to keep their company, ( W.) both for this and the next world.  
**3** *Kettle.* Made of iron. It will presently be broken. So the poor must suffer, if they marry, or have society with those who are much above their rank. C.  
**7** *Thou?* Distrust those who promise much. C.—*Spem pretio non emo* *.* Ter.  
**8** *Drawn.* Lit. “exhaust.” H.—He will feast thee, while he wants thy service, or he will come to dine with thee, and thus reduce thee to distress. Prov. 23:1. C.  
**10** *Humbled.* By foolishly attempting to rival the sumptuous feasts of the great. V. 9 and 11 are not in the Greek. H.  
**11** *Wisdom.* Depend not on others’ bounty. M.—When the cause of God is at stake, be firm, like S. Paul. C.—Pusillanimity in a superior might cause him to neglect his duty. W.  
**14** *Concerning*, &c. is not expressed in Gr. H.—If a person be so weak as to disclose his secret to a great man, he will never be trusted by him. C.  
**17** *Awake.* Be cautious even in sleep, if possible; or seem not to hear what passes at court. C.  
**19** *Himself.* Similarity of manners and of condition is favourable to friendship. C.—The good and bad cannot be friends, their manners are so different. Cic.  
**21** *Lamb.* Christ has taught people of different tempers to embrace the faith, which shows his admirable power. Is. 11:6.  
**25** *Away.* Ps. 61:4. C.—“It is human to push those who are falling.” Cic. pro Rabir.  
**26** *Helpers.* Who prevent his ruin, ( C.) and turn his words to good sense. M.—*Proud.* Gr. “what should not be disclosed,” απορρητα. H. C.—Their “fault increases, being fed by applause.” S. Greg. Mor. iv. 29.  
**28** *Clouds.* People suppose that the rich must possess genius. Hor. ii. Sat. iii.—“Every one honours the rich.” Theog. C.—Exception of persons hinders many good counsels, and promotes evil. W.  
**30** *U* *ngodly.* The abuse of riches is alone blameable. All things are clean for the clean, while the wicked perverts every advantage.  
**31** *Evil.* Sorrow will manifest itself. C.—*Imago animi vultus* *.* Cic. Decorat. iii.  
**32** *Find.* Few are perfectly sincere. C.—Gr. “a cheerful countenance *is* the vestige of a heart in good things, ( H. prosperity. M.) and the discovery of parables *is the effect* of laborious enquiries.” H.—Study makes the countenance serious. C.

## Chapter 14

**1** *Mouth.* He is *perfect.* James 3:2.  
**3** *Envious.* Who will neither use his wealth himself, nor bestow it. The true use of riches is to take a sufficiency, and to relieve the poor. C.  
**4** *Gathereth* *.* Gr. “taketh from his,” &c. H.—Such misers are continually derided, but will never be cured. Eccle. 2:18 and 6:2. An old proverb says, “The miser doth nothing right but when he dies.” C.  
**6** *Envieth* *.* By refusing himself the necessaries of life, he rejects God’s gifts, and scandalizes his neighbour. W.  
**7** *Wickedness.* Persisting covetous till death, as is commonly the case.  
**11** *Offerings.* Make a proper use of what God has bestowed. C.  
**12** *The covenant of hell.* The decree by which all are to go down to the regions of death, ( Ch.) which hell frequently denotes. H.—Under the old law, all went down into some part of hell. W.—*Hath been.* Gr. “hath not,” &c. We know not when we shall die, though all must taste of death, ( H.) and therefore we must make haste to do good. M.—*Shall*, or “is, he shall die the death,” (Gen. 2:17) as the Greek has this sentence. v. 18. H.  
**15** *Sorrows.* Gr. “toils,” or what thou hast amassed with much care. H.  
**16** *Take.* Alms-deeds will ensure the remission of sins. This usury is lawful. We must also keep up a good society with our friends. C.—*Ju* *stify.* Gr. “sanctify thy soul (17) for.” Grabe. H.—Some read “love,” or divert thy soul by lawful amusements. The argument is addressed to Jews and Gentiles. C.  
**18** Fade. Gr. “grow old like a garment. For the covenant from the beginning is, he shall die the death. Like a leaf flourishing on a bushy tree.” H.—Homer has the same thought, Il. vi.  
**20** *End.* The fruits of the Spirit are alone immortal. v. 21. Gal. 6:8.  
**27** *Glory.* As under the miraculous pillar. Ex. 24:17. He who shall abide with wisdom shall have nothing to fear. C.  

---

## Chapter 15

**1** *Good.* Gr. “these things, and he who possess the knowledge of the law will find her,” ( C.) or, “he who keeps the law, will receive her.” Grabe. 1 Cor. 4:20. H.—All who resolve to be virtuous, will have God’s grace, which preventeth them, and continueth to afford them assistance. W.  
**2** *Married.* Lit. “from virginity.” H.—Those who have been espoused in youth have the most durable love for one another. Prov. 2:17. Mal. 2:14. C.  
**5** *She.* Or Gr. “he shall open his mouth, (6) he shall find joy and a crown of exultation, and shall inherit,” &c. H.—*Church*, or assembly of the people. In both, the wise shall be heard with respect. C.  
**9** *Praise.* Or Gr. “a proverb,” Prov. 17:7 and 26:7. C.—David invites even dragons to praise God, but sinners never. S. Chrys. orat. prebyt. Ps. 49:16.—The person who preaches will, and lives not accordingly, injures God. W.  
**10** *Wisdom.* Gr. “it was not sent to him, ( C.) *or* he was not commissioned by the Lord. For praise shall be spoken in wisdom, and the Lord will give him success.”  
**11** *She.* Ignorance and vice are defects, and consequently not the work of God, but of the perversion of free-will. See Jam. 1:13. Ezec. 33:11. S. Aug. Grat. &. lib. ii. C.—Beza says, that God ordained Adam’s fall, but for a good end; and decreed justly what men unjustly perform, (ref. Castel. ii.) which is refuted here, and Deut. 7:11. &c. W.  
**14** *Counsel.* Many explain this of Adam, before his fall, when he stood not in need of asking continually for God’s assistance. S. Aug. correp. ii. n. 35.—But if we examine the context, it shews that man, in his present state, is declared inexcusable if he yield to sin, as he has still free-will, which may avoid it, with the grace of God, ( C.) which is always ready to support us. Gr. subjoins, (v. 16.) “if thou wilt, thou shall keep the commandments, even to execute faithfully the good pleasure. (17.) He.” &c. H.  
**15** *Precepts.* These would never be imposed, if man were not free. C.  
**17** *And fire.* Or, *good and evil*, as the Vulg. explains it, (v. 18) though the Gr. be silent. H.—The law written on the heart, as well as on the tables of stone, shews man his duty; and he has free-will to comply with it. Deut. 30:15. Jer. 21:8. C.—He may enjoy every advantage of life, denoted by these two elements. Lyr.  
**21** *Commanded.* He only permitted the wickedness of Semei, (2 K. 16:10) and the persecutors of his people, whose hearts are already bent on evil. S. Aug. Grat. & lib. xx.  

---

## Chapter 16

**1** *Rejoice.* Gr. “desire not an useless multitude of children,” &c.  
**2** *Labours.* All will end in ruin which springs from corruption. H.—Achab and Gedeon had seventy sons, but all were presently exterminated, while Abraham had a numerous posterity by his son Isaac.  
**7** *Out.* They shall perish by civil and foreign wars, ( C.) and by God’s indignation. Deut. 32:23. H.—They who yield to the fire of concupiscence, will feel God’s wrath for ever. W.  
**9** *Of their word*, is not in Gr. but may imply the effrontery of the Sodomites, who were not ashamed of openly professing their brutality. Ezec. 16:49. C.  
**11** *Six hundred thousand footmen*, &c. Viz. the children of Israel, whom he sentenced to die in the wilderness. Num. 14. ( Ch.) Ex. 12:37.  
**14** *Off.* The virtuous shall be rewarded. Rom. 2:6. Gr. “the patience of the impious shall not delay.” He shall soon be punished, ( H.) while he who gives only a cup of cold water to the poor, shall find a recompense. Matt. 10. W.  
**15** *And*, &c. is not in Gr. the different editions of which vary. C.—Instead of this sentence, Grabe inserts from the Comp. “the Lord hardened Pharao, that he might not know him, that his surprising works might be manifest under heaven. To every creature his mercy is evident, and he has divided his light from darkness with adamant. H.—His counsels are unsearchable, and the good are entirely separated from the reprobate. 1 Tim. 6:16. Lu. 16:26.  
**16** *High.* God would not be God if he were indifferent about virtue. None of his creatures can be beneath his notice. All the world is but like a drop of water to him. Is. 40:15. 22. He cannot be distracted. C.  
**20** *And.* Gr. “his ways.” v. 21. H.—God’s threats and promises touch not the sinner.  
**22** *Testament.* The law, or the judgment, which God shall pronounce. C.  
**26** *And their.* The heavenly bodies continue their courses, (Grot. Jans.) and all things still subsist, ( H.) being formed and preserved by an intelligent being. He refutes the epicureans. C.  
**29** *Be.* Gr. “they shall not disobey his order for ever.” H.—After the sun, &c. had been regulated on the fourth day, God set in order sublunary things. v. 30. C.  
**31** *Forth*, the glory and power of God upon the earth. Ch.—*Before.* Gr. “hath covered its (the earth’s) face, and into it,” &c. H.—All living creatures shall return to dust. Ps. 103:29. C.—Rational and brute creatures praise God by answering the ends designed by him. W.  

---

## Chapter 17

**1** *And made.* This is transposed in Gr. to the end of the third verse. H.—The creation of other things had been specified before. Man was designed to be immortal, and was made like to God in his soul, which is spiritual, intelligent, &c. But sin caused his days to be shortened. C.—By original sin, he lost the justice which he had at first received. W.  
**4** *Dominion* *.* This is greatly diminished since the fall. C.  
**6** *Evil.* Man has understanding, and may merit, which brutes cannot.  
**7** *Hearts.* God will bring them to judgment, and has given them a law. C.  
**9** *L* *ife.* The observance of which will insure life both now and for ever. Rom. 10:5. This was the peculiar privilege of Israel, ( C.) though the natural law had the same effect, and God had left none without sufficient light. H.—The law was for a trial of obedience. Gen. 2. W.  
**10** *Everlasting.* The gospel has perfected or fulfilled the law. Matt. 5:17.  
**11** *Saw.* When he gave the law on Mount Sinai. Ch. Ex. 20:18.—*Voice.* Thunder. Ps. 28:4. C.  
**12** *Neighbour.* Of whom the second table, or the seven last precepts of the law, speak. H.  
**13** *Eyes.* He conducted them in the pillar, and always watched over them. Gr. Rom. adds, “their ways are bent on evils from youth, and he could not.” Comp. “for every man is bent on evils from youth, and they could not from stony hearts make them fleshy, (Ezec. 36:26. C.) for in the division of the nations of all the earth (14) over,” &c. Grabe.  
**15** *God.* Comp. adds, “he nourishes him as his first-born with instruction, and dividing the light of love, he does not abandon him.” H.—But the Rom. edit. agrees with us. God declared himself king of Israel, ( C.) and its guardian, while he intrusted other nations to angels. Orig. S. Aug. Ps. cxxxviii. Glossa. Deut. 32:8.  
**16** *Ways.* He suffers them not to follow their own inclinations, like the Gentiles; but chastises them if they have done wrong. Acts 14:15. C.  
**17** *Covenants.* Gr. “injustices were not concealed from him, and all,” &c. H.—*God.* Complutensian adds, “but the Lord being good, and knowing his work, neither left nor abandoned them, still sparing them.” Heb. 13:5. H.—This is a gloss omitted in the Rom. edit. Ps. 77:34.  
**18** *Alms*, and all good works are placed in God’s treasury, and as a ring which a person wears on his finger with the utmost care. Jer. 22:24. Cant. 8:6.—*Eye.* Gr. Comp. adds, ( C.) “dividing to his sons and daughters penance, (19.) And.” H.—The Rom. and Ald. edit. agree with the Vulg.—*Head.* Giving a crown of glory.—*And shall*, &c. is not in Greek. It implies that the wicked will be punished like Core. C.  
**22** *Offend less:* *minue offendicula* *.* That is, remove sins, and the occasions of sins. Ch.  
**24** *And.* Gr. “return to the Highest, and be converted from injustice, (for he shall lead from darkness to the light of health) and greatly abhor abomination. Who shall praise the most high in hell, instead of the living, and of those who make a return of praise, *or* confession? Praise perisheth from the dead, as from one who has had no being. The living and sound of heart shall praise the Lord. (28.) How,” &c. H. Ps. 87:11. C.—We cannot merit perseverance, but must pray for it incessantly. W.  
**25** *Go to the side*, &c. Fly from the side of satan and sin, and join with the holy ones that follow God and godliness. Ch.—Christ is styled the father of the *age* to come. Is. 9. M.  
**29** *Immortal.* We all stand in need of a pardon. C.—*And.* Gr. (30.) “what … and it fails. And flesh and blood shall study evil. (31.) He.” H.—We cannot exact absolute perfection from any mortal. But still a person may be watchful, and trust in God’s mercies. C. 18. C.

## Chapter 18

**1** *Together*, as to their substance, though they received different forms successively, as Moses relates. Both writers are divinely inspired. S. Aug. de Gen. ad Lit. iv. 33. W. S. Tho. i. p. 974. a. 2.—Some suppose that all things were really formed in an instant, and that the order described by Moses is only as we should conceive it. Cajet.—This passage only means that God alone was the creator both of the sun and of man, and *without him nothing was made*, (Jo. 1. Ps. 32:15) as he gave existence to all, κοινη, “in common.” C.—*And he.* Gr. “and there is no other besides him who steers the world with the palm of his hand. And all things obey his will;; for he is king of all, in his might, separating what is holy among them from the profane. (2.) He has enabled no one to,” &c. H.  
**5** *Added.* The works speak for themselves, though man be silent. C.  
**6** *Begin.* God is so great and incomprehensible, that when an has done all that he can to find out his greatness and boundless perfections, he is still to begin: for what he has found out, is but a mere nothing, in comparison of his infinity. Ch.—It is best to adore him in silence and humility. C.  
**7** *Grace.* Gr. “utility.” H.—*Evil.* What can man do for or against God? Job 22:3. Ps. 15:2.  
**8** *Years.* Seneca fixes on the same number; (Brev. Vitæ. 3.) Macrobius on seventy, for the life of man; which nearly agrees with the author of Ps. 89:10. H.—It seldom happens that people exceed 70, or 100 years. But what is this compared with eternity? C.—Gr. “a hundred years are many … so are a thousand years in the day of the age,” or of αιωνος, eternity. H. Ps. 89:4 and 2 Pet. 3:8.  
**9** *Them.* Human misery calls forth God’s pity. C.  
**12** *Flesh.* It is infinite and disinterested. Man assists his neighbour expecting a recompense, and remembering that he may be distressed.  
**14** *Judgments.* To execute his orders. Here ends the discourse begun c. 14:22. C.  
**15** *Complaint.* Gr. “reproach.” H.—The manner of giving, enhances the value of the gift, or even surpasses it. C.  
**20** *Medicine.* This is more requisite and easy to do in the maladies of the soul, which are brought on by our own fault. *Principiis obsta* *.* C.—*Mercy.* Greek, “propitiation in the hour of visitation,” ( H.) or punishment. C.  
**21** *Sick.* Rom. Gr. adds, “by abstinence, and in the time of sins, manifest a conversion.” H.—If we take precautions to avoid illness, why should we neglect the concerns of our soul?—*Conversation*, or good conduct.  
**22** *Alw* *ays.* These admirable maxims seem copied from the gospel. Lu. 18:1. C.—The same spirit dictated all the Scriptures. H.—Those pray always who neglect not this duty at proper times, and are always resolved to do so. S. Aug. ep. 121. q. ad Prob. W.—Gr. “be not hindered from performing thy vow in good time, and wait not to be justified, ( H.) *or* to put it in execution till death. Deut. 23:21. Before thou takest a vow,” &c. Examine well if thou intend to perform it. C.  
**23** *God.* Can we expect that he will hear what we do not ourselves? To approach his majesty, without repentance and attention, is presumptuous. We must ask God to *open our lips*, and do what lies in us. Trid. C.  
**24** *Face*, saying to the reprobate, *Depart*, &c. C. 7:40. Matt. 25:41. H.  
**25** *Riches.* By their good use, lay up a treasure in heaven, and be always humble. C. 11:27.  
**26** *God.* All things continually change. C.—*Rotam volubili orbe versamus* *.* Boet. cons. 2.—Reflect on Aman and Mardochai. C.  
**27** *Thing.* Mindful of the reverse of fortune. C. 11:30. Prov. 28:14. C.—*Sloth*, and repent. Greek adds, “the fool will not observe the season.” H.  
**28** *Her.* It is a rare thing to discern and give due praise to merit. C.  
**29** *And judgments.* Gr. “full of accuracy.” Some add the title “restraint of the soul.” H.  
**31** *Ene* *mies.* This motive will make the most impression on those who are slaves to their passions. C.  
**32** *Small.* Lit. “nor in those which are small.” H.—Composed of the meanest citizens. Quarrels and sin are there almost inevitable. C.—Gr. “rejoice not in high living; nor beg for its symbol,” ( H.) or feast, in which each person contributed his share, συμβολη, as the next verse implies. C.—*Symbolum de* *dit, cænavit* *.* Ter. And.

## Chapter 19

**1** *Little.* Small expenses, often repeated, will ruin an estate, ( H.) and the neglect of venial sins is of the most dangerous consequence. C.—The best way to avoid great faults, is to guard against small ones. W.  
**2** *Off.* From God ( C.) and religion. See Gen. 19:33 and 2 K. 11:1. Os. 4:11.  
**3** *Number.* Of the living. H.—The venereal disease seems to be described.  
**4** *Credit.* To harlots. 1 Cor. 6:18. C.  
**5** *Hateth.* Gr. “resisteth pleasure, shall crown his life. He who guardeth his tongue, shall live without contention: and he,” &c. H.  
**6** *He.* Gr. omits this explication of the preceding verse.  
**8** *Not.* Only to God and his minister. Friends do not require to be informed of such things. Gr. “disclose not the conduct of others.”—*Be.* Gr. “be not.” Do not boast of sins which thou hast not committed, ( C.) as S. Aug. did before his conversion. H.—But the Vulg. seems preferable. C.—In ordinary conversation to reveal our faults would be dangerous, but not in confession, or in religious orders, for advancement in virtue. W.  
**9** *Hate thee.* Whether thou hast spoken of thy own or of others’ faults, he will distrust thee.  
**10** *Burst thee.* Like poison, or as new wine ( C.) does a leathern bottle. H.—This expression well implies the eagerness which some manifest to divulge a secret injurious to their neighbour. C.  
**13** *Understood.* Gr. “done it.” H.—For want of coming to a timely explanation, many friendships are broken, owing to groundless surmises.  
**15** *Committed.* Or “a false report,” *commissio* *.* C.—Gr. “a foolish calumny.” H.—*Monere* *et moneri proprium est veræ amicitiæ* *.* Cic.  
**17** *Him.* Gentle means must be first tried. Matt. 18:15. Gal. 6:1. H.  
**18** *Place.* Love true piety. C.—*Disposition.* Gr. “complying with.” H.—The Complut. has several additions which are not in the Rom. edit. C.—Grabe inserts them. But it is not necessary to mark here every such variation. H.  
**22** *Unjust.* S. James (3:15) describes true and false wisdom. Rom. 16:19. C.  
**23** *Wickedly.* Gr. “in black,” ( H.) wearing the robes of mourning. Grot.  
**24** *And.* Gr. “there,” &c. H.—The hypocrite abstains from exterior crimes, only through fear. C.—False pretence of piety, is hypocrisy; and it is wrong for a superior to reveal his secret faults to his subjects. Reason must direct. W.  
**26** *Countenance.* Yet this is not always the case. v. 28. We may sometimes condemn a person unjustly, on such outward appearances. C.  
**28** *Lying.* Gr. “a reproof which is not seemly; and there is one,” &c. H.  

---

## Chapter 20

**1** *Prayer.* A friend’s excuses must be heard. C.—Gr. “and he who apologises shall be preserved from ruin.” Grabe adds, “how good it is for one who has been rebuked,” &c. v. 4. H.—Thus the guilty merit pardon, and the innocent obtain a greater reward, and satisfy for former offences. W.  
**2** *Maiden.* Or “woman,” ( H.) who has been entrusted to his care. M.—Such people are not free from concupiscence, which must be restrained by the virtue of chastity. S. Aug. c. Jul. vi. 14.  
**8** *Hated.* As the pests of society. See Cic. off. 1.  
**9** *Loss.* The prosperity of the wicked must not be envied. Ps. 38:1, 8. C.  
**11** *Glory.* Galba “would have been universally deemed worthy of the empire, if he had not reigned.” Tacit. Hist. 1.—Adrian VI. thought the pontificate the greatest misfortune to which he had been exposed; and this observation ws engraven on his tomb.—*Estate.* By merit.  
**12** *Sevenfold.* As the merchandise was good for nothing, which the miser had obtained for a little money, thinking to save thereby.  
**13** *Graces.* Or favours bestowed with ill-nature.  
**14** *Sevenfold.* He expects more. C.—His intention is full of guile, who flattereth and detracteth for the sake of gain. W.  
**15** *Much.* As Dido did. “This is to make a display of favours to excite hatred.” Sen. Ben.

**17** *Have.* Gr. “say I have,” &c.—*His.* Gr. “my,” as also v. 18. H.—Such is the language of the fool.

**20** *Pavement.* It is equally destructive.  
**21** *Grace*, (*acharis*) impolite and importunate. C.  
**23** *Shall.* Gr. adds, “not.” Yet if a person has had the will to offend, he must repent, though the could not put it in execution. H.

**29** *A.* Gr. adds a title, “discourses of proverbs.”  
**30** *And … exalted*, is not in Gr. but explains the meaning of the former sentence.—*Escape.* Gr. “obtain pardon for iniquity.” H.—The great will protect him.  
**31** *Make.* Gr. “like a bit in the mouth, remove corrections.” Ex. 23:8. C.  
**32** *Both?* He who, through a false humility refuses to take charge of others, resembles a man who locks up his corn in time of scarcity. S. Greg. Part. iii. 26. Matt. 25. C.—Wisdom must be shewn for the benefit of others. W.  
**33** *Folly.* He may still appear to have some sense, and injures none.—It is convenient to conceal faults, provided they be amended. W.

## Chapter 21

**1** *Thee.* The just may offend: but the wicked relapse continually.  
**2** *Hold.* Gr. “bite,” ( C.) in the same sense. M.—Serpents sting in secret: so all sins inveigle the soul. W.  
**3** *Lion.* Yet only those are hurt, who consent to sin. The devil may go *round about*, (1 Pet. 5:8) and tempt; ( C.) he cannot bit, except a man willingly expose himself, and *come near.* v. 2.  
**4** *Remedy.* In man. H.—Only the sovereign physician can cure it. C.  
**5** *Riches.* As they make enemies arise. Gr. subjoins, “so the house of the proud shall be made desolate.” H.—Roboam lost ten tribes by an insolent answer, and the Tarquins were expelled for their pride.

Some Gr. copies have, “stones for a heap over his tomb,” as Achan and Absalom were treated. Reputation, or goods ill-acquired, will not continue long. W.

**11** *Stones.* It is broad and easy. Matt. 7.

**15** *Bitterness.* True wisdom promotes the general good.

**13** *Day.* There was a longer time assigned for great men. Gen. 50:3. Num. 20:30 and Deut. 34:8.—*Life.* This is understood of those who have lost all reason, or sense of religion. S. Monica wept for her son, hoping that he would repent, as a certain bishop had comforted her. S. Aug. Conf. iii. ult.  
**17** *Lead?* Gold alone is heavier. But the fool is compared with lead, and is most insupportable.

**6** *Foolish*, (*infrunitæ*) is used in this sense by Seneca. C.—Greek has not this epithet. The title, “instruction of the mouth,” follows, ( H.) to v. 20. C.  
**10** *Them.* Gr. Alex. has only (9.) “swearing, (10) and have not a custom of naming the Most High.” Other editions have “the holy one.” H.—Rash and false oaths are forbidden. Jer. 4. Matt. 5. W.

**15** *Opposite.* Or equal. Gr. “clothed with death.” He denotes blasphemy, (Lev. 24:14) or the invitation to idolatry, (Deut. 13:1) or calumny. v. 17. Lev. 19:12. C.—In oaths God is called to witness, as being unable to deceive. But blasphemy attributes to him or to others what does not belong to them. W.  
**16** *Merciful.* Or true believers, Assideans. 1 Mac. 2:42.  
**17** *Of sin.* A Hebrew idiom, to imply something criminal. Those who have laid aside shame, are capable of any wickedness.  
**18** *Men.* Treat thy parents with no less regard, ( C.) even though thou shouldst be exalted in dignity. Lyr.—Thus thou wilt be rewarded, ( C.) of if thou transgress, wilt be brought to judgment. Bossuet.—Gr. “thou shalt sit,” &c. H.

## Chapter 24

**1** *Wisdom.* Gr. title, “the praise of wisdom.” Here the book of Ecclesiastes is imitated. H.—See also Prov. 8 and Wisd. 7:24 and 8:1. The pagans boasted of their philosophy. But it was not to be compared with the true religion, which the Israelites possessed.—*Own self.* Lit. “soul.” She alone is capable of this office. C.—*In God.* Referring all the glory to him. M.—This sentence is not in Gr. H.—The second person of the Trinity proclaims his own praises. W.  
**2** *Power.* The temple, rather than in the schools of Athens. C.  
**3** *And.* Gr. (5.) “I came out of the mouth of the Highest, (6) and as,” &c. H.—He alludes to the darkness which covered the earth. Gen. 1:2. Job 38:9. Many explain this of the uncreated wisdom, born in the womb of the blessed Virgin; and the Church, in her office, applies it to her in a mystical sense. But it seems literally to refer to the wisdom and grace granted to the saints, which enlightens every man, and presides over the creation.  
**7** **Ver** **.** **7** **.** *Cloud.* Guiding the Israelites (Ex. 13:21) or near the throne of God. Wisd. 9:4. C.

**13** *And take*, &c. is not in Gr. H.—This may be explained of the true religion, or ( C.) of the word of the Father. S. Aug. Trin. i. 12.—In the Church only is effectual grace, ( W.) or none will receive it, who refuses to hear the Church. H.  
**14** *Created.* Or engendered. Prov. 8:22.—*Him.* As his priestess, directing all the ministers of the temple. C.—Christ is begotten by the understanding, and the Holy Ghost proceeds from love. Creation is not here taken strictly. W.  
**16** *His.* Gr. “of his inheritance, (17.) I,” &c. H.  
**17** *Sion.* Beyond the Jordan. Gr. “Hermon.” Deut. 4:48.  
**18** *Cades-* barne. Num. 20:1. Gr. “Engaddi,” ( C.) or Rom. and Alex. edit. “on the sea shore.” H.  
**19** *In the streets*, in not in Gr. C.—Grabe inserts, *by the waters.* H.—These trees flourish most in such situations, and people delighted to walk under them in hot countries.  
**20** Myrrh. Which distills through the bark, without any incision.  
**21** *Onyx.* A shell-fish in the Indies, which feeds on the *spica nardi*, and hence becomes odoriferous.—*Aloes*, (gutta) the finest myrrh.—*Not cut.* Gr. “in a tent.”—*And my*, &c. is not in Gr. Wisdom is compared to what was most esteemed. C.  
**22** *Honour.* Rich and pleasant. H.  
**24** *I*, &c. Grabe restores this verse, and, instead of the next, has, “but I am given to all my children, being born *myself* for ever, to those who are specified by him. (26.) Come,” &c. H.—The text seems to be corrupt. C.  
**25** *Life.* Christ declares himself to be, *the way, the truth, and the life.*  
**27** *Spirit.* Greek, “remembrance.” It has not the following verse.  
**29** *Thirst.* Without being ever disgusted. Jo. 4:13. C.—Experience of carnal delights is quite the reverse. S. Greg. hom. xxxvi. Ev.—The more grace a person has, the more he desireth and receiveth from God. W.  
**30** *Sin.* Or lose their labour. They shall be directed in the paths of life. C.  
**31** *They.* Gr. “all these things *are* the book of the covenant of the most high God, the law which Moses gave unto us, an inheritance to the synagogues of Jacob.” Grabe puts in a different character from the Compl. “Lose not strength in the Lord, but stick to him, that he may strengthen you. The Lord Almighty is the only God, and there is no other Saviour.” Then follows, (v. 35.) “who,” &c. H.—*Everlasting.* Provided his life correspond with his doctrine. No occupation can be more glorious. C.—Let thy Scriptures be my chaste delights: let me not be deceived in them, nor deceive *others* by them. S. Aug. Conf. xi. 2. C. Dan. 12. M.  
**32** *Truth.* They are equally certain, and no more is required. C.—He that loves has fulfilled the law. H.  
**34** *King.* Viz. Christ, who by his gospel, like an overflowing river, hath enriched the earth with heavenly wisdom. Ch.—*Ever.* The Lord ( H.) is a king, (Carriers) *who*, &c. v. 35. H.—Solomon’s wisdom is also praised. C.—The sceptre of David remained till the captivity, and the royal family continued in esteem till Christ. Yet David was only a figure of Christ, the eternal king. W.  
**35** *Phison* *.* Or Phase of Colchis, which rises in Armenia, like the Tigris and Euphrates, all which overflow their banks at the beginning of summer, on account of the snow melting.  
**36** *Harvest.* The snow of Libanus make the Jordan swell at Pentecost. Jos. 3:15.  
**37** *Light.* Giving to all the light of reason, and to Israel the law. Ps. 147:20.—*Gehon* *.* Or Araxes, which descends from Armenia into the Caspian sea, though some erroneously take it to be the Nile, ( C.) which overflows at the same time as the Euphrates. Pliny xviii. 18. Solon xlvi.  
**38** *Of her.* Christ was the first that had perfect knowledge of heavenly wisdom. Ch.—This is the privilege of God. Gr. “the first hath not perfect,” &c.  
**40** *Rivers* of saving waters, on all, but particularly ( H.) on Judea. v. 42. Gr. “and like a ditch (*dioryx* *.* C.) from a river, and as an aqueduct, I came into paradise,” ( H.) like the four rivers aforesaid. Gen. 2.  
**44** *Off.* He alludes to the conversion of the Gentiles.  
**45** *I wil* *l.* Many Fathers explain this of Christ’s descent into hell. But as it occurs not in the Gr. if may be considered as the tradition of the first Christians, who gave this version, ( C.) or they found it in their copies. H.  
**46** *Prophecy.* Of no less authority. The prophets had ceased for some time before Christ. C.—*Them.* Gr. “to ages of ages. See,” &c. H.  
**47** *I.* Wisdom, or the author of this book. C. 33:18. Wisd. 7:13. C.

## Chapter 25

**1** *Pleased.* Wisdom still speaks. Solomon often makes similar division, to make the deeper impression. Prov. 30:15. 24.  
**4** *Fool.* Gr. “adulterer, devoid of sense.” Is. 65:20. C.—*Luxuria … senectuti fœdissima* *.* Cic. off. i.  
**5** *Age?* Wisdom, says Bias, “is more durable than other possessions.” Laert.

**10** *Enemies.* Not out of revenge, but for the glory of God. See Matt. 5:43.  
**12** *A true*. Gr. “prudence.” C.  
**14** *Things.* Gr. adds, “for light (15) he that,” &c. H.  
**16** *It.* This is not in the edit. of Rome, or of Aldus: but it is in the rest. Fear commonly begins the work of salvation, and love perfects it. 1 Tim. 1:5. C.—All happiness in this life is grounded on the fear of God. W.  
**17** *Evil.* Gr. reads not this; but the Syriac does, omitting the two next verses. C.—Heresy is described under the idea of a wicked woman, concealing her malice. W.  
**18** *Choose.* Lit. “see.” H.—Some supply “send any plague,” &c.  
**21** *Enemies.* Which they wish, or may behold. C. 18:31. C.  
**22** *Hea* *d.* Or poison, as the Heb. rosh signifies both. Rondet.  
**23** *Woman.* Gr. “enemy.” C.—Revenge is the passion of little souls, and of women. Juv. xiii.—*Dragon.* This is not exaggerated, if we reflect on the evils occasioned by Eve, Dalila, Athalia, &c. C.—“A woman is the greatest wild-beast.” Menander.  
**24** *Sackcloth.* And is black when passion bursts forth, though women too frequently conceal their anger to take deeper vengeance.  
**25** *Groaned.* Gr. “shall fall.”—*Little.* Gr. “bitterly.” He cannot avoid hearing of his wife’s misconduct. H.—She will raise him enemies on all sides.  
**26** *Her.* I could wish no greater evil to the worst of enemies. Eccles. 7:27.  
**27** *Man.* He cannot advance. C.—*Semper habet lites* *.* Juv. vi.  
**28** *Beauty.* Other qualifications of more importance must be regarded. H.—He should choose one who may be a companion and assistant in domestic concerns. Grot.  
**30** *A.* Gr. “If she bring a fortune to her husband,” ( H.) she will continually upbraid him with it, and cover him with *confusion.* v. 29. C.—Lay-leadership in spiritual things is so unreasonable, that few heretics will endure it. W.  
**32** *Happy.* A lazy wife will give no content.  
**33** *Die* *.* Eve tempted her husband, and thus we are all involved in sin. 1 Tim. 2:14.  
**34** *Water.* Incontinency. C. 26:15. Prov. 5:15. If water find a hole, it will presently flow away. Women were kept much at home in the East, as they are in many parts of Europe. C.—Retirement and silence are the characteristics of a wise woman. Æschyl. Thebas.  
**35** *She will.* Gr. “cut her off from thy flesh.” Grabe and Comp. add, ( H.) “give a bill of divorce or her dowry, and send her away.” C.

## Chapter 26

**1** *Double.* Uneasiness deprives a person of much comfort. W.  
**3** *To a*, &c. is not in Gr. H.  
**5** *Fourth.* A jealous wife. v. 8.  
**6** *City.* When all are charge with a crime, or when all rise up against a man. C.  
**8** *Woman.* Gr. adds, “against another woman.”  
**9** *With.* Gr. “and the scourge of the tongue, which,” &c. H.—Back-biting occasions the four evils aforesaid. Grot.  
**10** *Woman.* When oxen move, the yoke moves also: Thus heresy will suffer none to rest. W.—The yoke ought to fit the neck, and not be fastened to the horns. Colum. ii. 2.  
**11** *Hid.* She will be given to debauchery. S. Chrys. C.—Romulus ordered wives to be slain, like adulteresses, who had drunk wine at home. V. Max. vi. 3.

**20** *Continent* *.* Adhering to virtue. C.  
**22** *Holy.* Made of gold, and placed in the sanctuary. M.  
**23** *Soles.* Gr. “heels.” Comp. “solid pavement.” A long addition follows in this edition, which is inserted by Grabe, ( H. but is not in the best copies. C.) instead of the following verse. H.  
**26** *Poverty.* The Romans provided for veteran soldiers, as Louis XIV. did with great magnificence. C.—Greenwich hospital is for the same purpose. H.—*Despised.* Solomon make the same complaint. Eccle. 9:15.  
**27** *To sin.* He is less excusable, as he knows what he abandons. Jer. 2:12. C.  
**28** *Two.* Gr. “scarcely is a merchant exempt from negligence, and the seller *of wine*, and eatables, (Grot.) or *retailer* (Voss. καπηλος) shall not be justified from sin.” H.—*Negligence.* That is, from the neglect of the service of God: because the eager pursuit of the mammon of this world, is apt to make men of that calling forget the great duties of loving God above all things, and their neighbours as themselves.—*A huckster.* Or a retailer of wine. Men of that profession are both greatly exposed to danger of sin themselves, and are too often accessary to the sins of others. Ch.—*Lips.* Innkeepers talk too much to please, and thus fall into danger. Prov. 10:19. W.—They are also exposed to lying, ( M.) and to adulterate their merchandise. C.  

---

## Chapter 27

**1** *Poverty.* Gr. “the indifferent thing,” as the Stoics represented money. C. 7:20.—*Sinned.* Hence proceeds the danger to which little merchants are exposed. Involuntary povery is very miserable. Prov. 30:9  
**2** *Fast.* Anacharsis styled “the market-place the receptacle of mutual cheating.” Laert. 1.—The seller praises his goods to get them off: (Hor.) the buyer says *it is ba* *d.* Prov. 20:14. The next verse is a gloss omitted in Gr. C.  
**4** *Fear.* By this the soul is preserved in a good state. W.  
**5** *Thoughts.* The more he thinks on some things, the more is he perplexed. C.—After sin is purged away, there remains some defects like *dust.* Ps. 50:4. W.  
**6** *Affliction.* Gr. “thought,” ( H.) or speech. C.—A young man being brought to Socrates, that he might pass judgment on his dispositions, the philosopher ordered him to “speak.” Cic.  
**7** *As.* Gr. “the fruit shews the dressing,” &c.  
**9** *Honour.* The desire of justice is the sure method to obtain it. The rest is not in Gr. H.  
**11** *Iniquities.* They fall deeper, or sin entails punishment. C.  
**12** *A.* Gr. “the speech of the wise man is wisdom throughout: but,” &c. H.—The fool always mixes something improper with what good he speaks. C.—*Sun.* The wise man preserves his virtue, whether it appear or not. W.  
**13** *Keep.* Gr. “wait an opportunity.” H.—Go but seldom. Their discourse tends to promote iniquity, (v. 14) and blasphemous oaths, (v. 15) and bloodshed. v. 16. C.  
**15** *Ears.* The Jews did so, when they heard blasphemy. Acts 7:56. M.  
**17** *Mind.* In Egypt, those who disclosed a secret to the enemy, were condemned to have their tongues cut out. Diod. ii. 2.  
**19** *Him.* He will never trust thee more. v. 22.  
**20** *Friend.* Sept. Rom. and Alex. “enemy.” H.—This crime is like murder. The Romans sometimes solemnly renounced the friendship of those who had offended them, as Germanicus and Caius did that of Piso. Tacit. An. 2. Suet. 3.  
**22** *Because.* Gr. “for one may bind up a wound, and an insult may be pardoned. But he who hath revealed secrets, hath lost all hope,” ( H.) or “confidence.” v. 24 c. 22:27.  
**25** *Off.* Some Gr. copies have, “he who knows him will depart from him.” It is difficult to guard against a false friend, who winks as if he desired to please us, ( C.) while he really seeks our ruin. v. 26.  
**28** *Wound.* Gr. “deal wounds. He,” &c. H.—Traitors, in the dark, often wound their fellows, ( C.) or themselves. M.  
**29** *Setteth* *.* Gr. “layeth a snare, shall perish in it.”  
**30** *Him.* God will punish, when the sinner has perhaps forgotten his offence. C.—Such are often chastised here, and always hereafter. W.  
**33** *Them.* He shall feel the indignation of God, ( C.) and shall repine. H.  

---

## Chapter 28

**1** *Sins.* To seek revenge out of rancour, or contrary to justice, is a grievous sin. W.—Retaliation was tolerated, (Ex. 21:24) but love was not to be laid aside. Deut. 33:3–5. Lev. 21:17. Ps. 7:5. Mat. 7:2.  
**2** *Forgive.* This charity enforces, when the offender is penitent, if the remission of punishment be not contrary to justice and discipline. W.—Mat. 6:12,. and 18:32. Lu. 6:37. We all stand in need of pardon. C.  
**5** *And doth.* Gr. “who will expiate his sins?” Is God bound to receive his victims or prayers while he entertains such dispositions? C.  
**7** *In his* *commandments.* Supply the sentence out of the Greek thus: Remember corruption, and death, and *abide in the commandments*, ( Ch.) which condemn revenge. Ex. 23:4. C.—Comp. “and do not rage *or* menace thy neighbour with destruction and death; yea, stick to the commandments. Be mindful of the precepts, and be not angry with thy neighbour; and of the covenant,” &c. v. 9. H.  
**9** *Ignorance.* He uses a softer term. In effect, most quarrels proceed from a misunderstanding. “Every sinner is ignorant.”  
**12** *Burneth* *.* The more fuel, the greater will be the blaze.  
**13** *And a*, &c. is not in Gr. Prov. 19:12 and 26:21.  
**16** *Third.* Who carries stories between friends, to set them at variance. C.  
**18** *It*, &c. is omitted in Greek. H.—Indiscreet reports often cause dissensions. W.  
**19** *Labo* *urs.* Causing their husbands to suspect them.  
**22** *Their own.* Gr. “the.” Detraction separates many friends. C.  
**25** *Hell.* Or rather “the grave.”  
**26** *Its.* Gr. “it shall not take hold of the pious, and they shall not,” &c. H.—Their virtue shall quickly shine forth. C.  
**28** *Hear.* Gr. “lo, hedge in thy possessions with thorns: bind up thy silver and gold.” H.—To pay attention to detraction is as bad as to utter it. W.  
**29** *Just.* Gr. “a door and bolt,” &c. as v. 28. If people guard their property with so much care, why do they make light of words? H.—These ought to be weighed with more attention than money, and we ought to spare no pains or expense on this head. C.  
**30** *Tongue.* Gr. “by them, lest thou fall before him who lays snares.” C. 29. H.

## Chapter 29

**1** *Hand.* That is, he that is hearty and bountiful in lending to his neighbour in his necessity. Ch.—*Fœnus*, in this book means simply “lending.” Rondet.—This is a work of mercy, and a sort of alms. Justice requires that the thing should be restored, and if any refuse on purpose, he is as bad as a thief. W.—He who lends will receive usury from the Lord. Prov. 19:17. Ps. 36:21.—*In hand.* Rich.  
**2** *Time.* The neglect of this causes many to be unwilling to lend. C.  
**5** *Hands.* Like slaves. Macrob. 1.—Others kiss the face, neck, &c. Acts 20:37.  
**7** *Found it.* Seeming to make thee partaker of his good fortune, (Jans.) or he will keep the other half as his own. Grot.  
**9** *Injuries.* Thus one loses both money and friends. Must we then never lend? If the person be poor, we must be ready to give. C.  
**11** *And delay.* Or lit. “and for an alms, drag him not along.” H.—Let not the fraud of many deter thee from assisting the poor, for the sake of God and justice. C.—*Si fraudaris pecunia acquiris justitiam* *.* S. Amb. Tob. iii. n. 11.  
**12** *Commandment.* Deut. 15:7. Else where is your merit?  
**13** *Friend.* He is entitled to partake of all thy goods. If he be only thy fellow-creature, assist him; and God will reward thee. Mat. 6:19.  
**15** *Heart.* Gr. “thy store-houses,” the poor. C.—I never read that one who was liberal to the poor came to an evil death, as he has so many to intercede for him, whose prayers must be heard. S. Jer. ad Nepot.—Works of mercy produce the best fruits. W.  
**18** *Himself.* Yet he will not engage his word for more than he can pay, (v. 27 c. 8:16) nor encourage the negligence of debtors. Prov. 6:1.  
**19** *Life.* Or his subsistence, (c. 19:28) though some answered for the person of another. 3 K. 20:39.  
**20** *And.* Gr. “will turn away the goods of his surety, (21) and the ungrateful in mind will abandon his redeemer.” H.—“All hate the ungrateful,” (Cic. off. ii.) and the Persians punished such with death. Xenop. Cyr. i.—*Him.* Gr. subjoins v. 23. H.

**26** *Not.* Prudence requires that we should not ruin ourselves to help others. W.  
**27** *Shame.* Clothing is like a portable *house.* Grot.—Man stands in need of little, and those who are content will not need to borrow. v. 29.  
**31** *Shall.* Or “has *formerly entertained*” those, who now reproach him, make him serve in the meanest offices, and at last cast him forth. It may also signify that people who receive ungrateful vagabonds, will be required to serve them, and had better keep them out. v. 33. C.—Gr. “thou shalt entertain and give drink to the most disagreeable things.” H.  
**32** **V** **er.** **32** **.** *Others.* Gr. “me.” M.—Travellers carried their provisions with them. C.  
**33** *Give.* Gr. “depart, stranger, from the face of glory; for,” &c. H.  
**34** *Lender.* Who demands his money, and upbraids his debtor. M.

## Chapter 30

**1** *He.* Gr. prefixes “on children.” H.—*And not*, &c. is omitted in Gr. It may signify, and not beg, ( C.) or steal. H.—The welfare of the country depends on the good education of children, which cannot be performed without correction, ( C.) though this should never be used till more gentle means have been tried. Fenelon on Educ.—The neglect of correction proceeds from a misplaced tenderness, (Prov. 13:24) which in the end proves most prejudicial both to the child and to the public. H.—See Plato, rep. ii. and vii. Arist. pol. vi. Cic. off. ii. C.  
**2** *Them.* Gr. “his acquaintance.” H.—He sees himself re-born in his son. v. 4. C.  
**7** *Wounds.* To which he has exposed himself for his child’s welfare, (2 Cor. 12:15. Raban.) or if he neglect correction, he will have to bewail the wounds which his son’s imprudence shall occasion. Syr. Vat. Gr. Comp. “He who rubs, (Rom. edit.) cherishes his son,” &c. C.—The eldest brother must take care of the rest, so as even to expose himself to danger. W.  
**8** *Horse.* A colt full of spirit, when properly broken in, will answer best, so a proper education corrects impetuous tempers. Plut. apop. in Them.  
**10** *Laugh.* “Smiling he must be feared.” S. Greg. Mor. xx. 3.  
**11** *Devices.* Gr. “sins of ignorance.” Youth is incapable of guiding itself, being destitute of experience, and too confident. Ezek. 45:20.  
**13** *Thee.* “Very few excel their father.” Hom. Odys. E.—This is sometimes to be attributed to the neglect of education. C.—Gr. subjoins, “on health.” H.  
**14** *Evils.* Health is better than riches. Pythag. &c.  
**15** *Justice.* This is the first of all advantages. C.—Thales pronounced him happy who was healthy and rich, and whose “soul was well tutored.” Laert.—Gr. “health and a good constitution are preferable to all gold, and a,” &c. H.  
**17** *Rest.* In the grave. He speaks not of the soul. Job 3:13.  
**18** *Grave.* The dead cannot partake of them, ( C.) so neither can the sick of their great possessions. H.—It was customary to place meat on the tombs of the dead. C.—The pagans invited them to eat; (S. Epip. Ancor.) but the faithful intended it for the poor, who might pray ( C.) for the deceased. M. C. 7:37. Tob. 4:18.—The kings of France were served at table till they were placed in the tomb, and in many monasteries the usual portion is assigned the dead for thirty days, and given to the poor. C.  
**21** *Sighing.* Thus meat is useless to those whom God visits with sickness. See c. 20:3.

**26** *Envy.* Or jealousy. These passions banish joy. Envy is like rust. C.  
**27** *Always.* Gr. “will mind the meats which it shall eat.” H.—It will feast and enjoy content. This verse and the following chapters are in a much less natural order in the Gr. editions, till c. 37. C.

## Chapter 31

**1** *Riches.* Lit. “honesty” has this sense. H.—The study of virtue and of the Scriptures removes temptations of the flesh. S. Jer. ad Rust. W.

Cler. xxx.—Not to transgress, on such occasions, is the greatest miracle. C.—Man has free will, and those are happy, who, by God’s grace, do not abuse it. W.  
**11** *In*, &c. Gr. Alex. “and wisdom (Grabe substitutes *the Church*) shall proclaim his alms.” H.—God will bless his riches. C.  
**12** *Be*, &c. Gr. “do not open,” ( H.) shew not too much greediness.

**25** *Vom* *it.* Some have omitted this term as indelicate; but the Scripture does not approve of intemperance, while it advises the preventing of a disorder. A man’s stomach may sometimes be innocently overcharged. On such occasions, an emetic was prescribed. The ancients had nt the same horror of it as moderns. Prov. 23:8. C.—Cicero, addressing Cæsar, says, *Cum te vomere post cænam velli dixisses* *.* Pro. R. Dejot.—*And thou.* Gr. “hear,” &c.  
**27** *Quick.* Intemperance and idleness are the great sources of illness.

**14** *Storm.* Lit. “hail.” Gr. “thunder.” H.—It comes forth at the same time as the lightning, but travels slower. C.—*For.* Gr. (15.) “at,” &c. H.—Young people must leave the table, and take recreation.  
**17** *Bless.* This is taught by the light of reason, (C. 5:7) and the omission before or after meals betrays a want of faith and gratitude, particularly in Christians.—*Replenisheth* *.* Gr. “inebriateth thee with his goods.” H.  
**20** *Light.* They shall advance in virtue and glory. Prov. 4:18. C.  
**21** *Excus* *e.* Lit. “comparison.” “He will bend the law to his desires.” Thus heretics interpret Scripture. H.—Gr. “he will find condemnation.”

**25** *Rugged way.* The end of which is unknown. Lu. 14:28. C.—*Lest.* Gr. “and keep a guard over thy children. In every good work confide in thy soul; for,” &c. H.  
**27** *In faith.* That is, follow sincerely thy soul in her faith and conscience, ( Ch.) when it is well informed. Gr. “in every good work believe thy soul; for,” &c. C.—Act not in opposition to it. W.—Rondet and Grotius would read, “in every work believe in God with all thy soul.”—*All that is not of faith is sin*, (Rom. 14:23) inasmuch as it is against conscience. H.

## Chapter 33

**1** *Evils.* God will make all turn to the advantage of the elect.  
**3** *To him.* God will fulfill all his promises. C.—Gr. continues, “as the interrogation ( H.) of the Urim, (δηλων. C.) prepare what to say, and so thou shalt be heard. Put on instruction, and thus reply.” H.—Speak not without being prepared.  
**5** *Cart.* Inconstant and grating. C.—The wicked turn from one vice to another, as heretics devise many errors, not having their heart established in grace. Heb. 13:9. W.  
**6** *Him.* And will be unmanageable, ( M.) when he has any thing to ridicule. C.—*Qui captat ri* *sus* *.* Hor. i. Sat. 4.  
**7** *Another.* God’s will alone appoints one to be holy or fine; and another to be stormy, or dedicated to labour. C.—*And one.* Gr. “and all the light of the day throughout the year proceeds from the sun.”  
**8** *The sun.* Gr. “and he distinguished the seasons and holidays (10) some,” &c.  
**10** *Great.* Gr. “holy.” H.—Thus all men are by nature equal. Yet what difference do we not find in their condition? Some live in obscurity, who might have shone upon the throne; and this is God’s will. C.  
**12** *Station.* Exterminating the Chanaanites. God disposes of all with sovereign power and justice. Rom. 9:29.  
**14** *Ordering.* All depend on God. C.—“The predestination of the saints is nothing but the foreknowledge and preparation of God’s benefits, by which those are most certainly liberated who obtain their freedom. But where are the rest left; except in the mass of perdition, by the just judgment of the Deity? S. Aug. Persev. xiv. n. 35, and Corrept. xiii. n. 42.  
**15** **V** **er.** **15** **.** *Another.* Lights and shades both contribute to form the beauty of a picture. H.—Antitheses adorn a discourse, as opposite things do the universe. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. xi. 18.—God will make the wicked subservient to his glory.  
**16** *Of all.* Solomon, Ezechias, &c. made various collections of similar maxims. C.—The books of the Machabees were alone written after this in the Old Testament. M.—Gr. places what follows after C. 30:26. These four verses may be regarded as a sort of preface. H.  
**21** *Change thee.* That is, so as to have this power over thee. Ch.—Be inflexible on this head. C.  
**23** *The pre-eminence.* That is, be master in thy own house, and part not with thy authority. Ch.—Let not thy wife or servants rule in thy name. M.  
**25** *Fodder.* Gr. prefixes “on slaves.” H.—They were bought like horses. Aristotle (Œcon. i. 5.) gives the like instructions on their treatment. C.  
**27** *A still.* Gr. “the neck, (28) torture,” &c. H.  
**31** *Faithful*, is not expressed in Gr. but must be understood.—*Blood.* Taking him prisoner at the hazard of thy life. The like misfortune might easily have befallen thee. C.—Seneca (ep. 47.) says, “live so with thy inferior, as thou wouldst have thy superior live with thee.”  
**33** *Thou.* Gr. “on what road wilt thou seek for him?”

## Chapter 34

**1** *The.* Gr. “on dreams. The,” &c. H.—No dependence can be had on the pretended interpretation of dreams, which do not come from God; ( C.) as some do. Mat. 1. Dan. 2. W.  
**3** *Man.* When he turns away from the mirror, it appears no more. Jam. 1:23.  
**4** *Unclean.* This text has been abused, to prove that the sinner cannot confer grace in the sacraments. C.—But Christ does this by his ministry. S. Aug. Ps. x. n. 6.  
**5** *Deceitful.* Gr. “divinations, and auguries, and dreams, are vain.”  
**6** *Travail.* Such things cannot be explained. Twenty people will all give different interpretations.—*High*, as those of Jacob, Joseph, &c. were. Yet it is difficult to make the discrimination. S. Greg. dial. iv. 48.—Homer admits of two sorts of dreams. Odys. xix.  
**7** *Them.* The devil takes advantage of their weakness, and they have recourse to magic, &c. C.  
**8** *Law*, which forbids attention to dreams. Lev. 19:26. Is. 8:20. A. Lap.—No part of the law shall perish; and some will always explain it truly. W.  
**9** *What.* Gr. “A man who has travelled, knows much,” &c. H.—Thus Ulysses became so wise, (Homer) as well as the ancient philosophers, Pythagoras, &c. S. Jer. ad Paulin.—The knowledge derived from books will not suffice. C.  
**10** *Experienced.* Gr. “much abroad, shall abound with subtlety. (11.) I,” &c.  
**12** *And.* Gr. “And I know more than I announce.” Grabe’s edit.  
**13** *For.* Gr. “On account of these things I have been saved:” ( H.) by my great experience, which gives weight to my instructions.  
**14** *Is.* Gr. “shall live. (15.) For … them. (16.) He,” &c. H.  
**20** *From falling*, or when a person is fallen.  
**21** *Mockeries.* Some Gr. copies have “gifts.” Such unjust presents or sacrifices, God will abhor. Is. 41:8. Deut. 24:15. C.  
**22** *L* *ord.* Gr. (23.) “most … wicked, nor,” &c.  
**26** *Bread.* Gr. “a livelihood, killeth his neighbour; and he sheddeth blood, who keepeth back the hire of the workman.” H.  
**28** *Labour?* So, if your sacrifices be ill-gotten, they will not be received; and if you relapse, you will be as bad as ever. C.  
**30** *Dead.* Lit. “is baptized by *or* from the dead;” *baptizatur a mortuo* *.* H.—S. Cyprian thought this text was peremptory against the baptism of heretics; and Donatists were of the same opinion. They seem not to have read, *if he touch him again*, which entirely alters the meaning. S. Aug. admonishes them of this; though he explains it of the pagan rather than of the Jewish purifications, to which it refers. Num. 19:11. See S. Aug. c. Cres. i. 24. and ii. 25. c. Petil. i. 9. S. Cyp. ep. ad Quint. C.  
**31** *Prayer.* A relapse makes the former repentance unless. Mat. 18:33. W.

## Chapter 35

**1** *Offerings.* He cannot otherwise observe the law. H.—Virtue is the most acceptable sacrifice. C.—The sacrifices of penance, of justice, and of praise, are to be preferred before all external ones. W.  
**2** *And to.* Gr. (4.) “He,” &c. H.—The peace-offering and that for sin, as well as the oblation of fine flour and of praise, (which is the most perfect of all) are noticed. C.—External sacrifice must not be neglected. W.  
**4** *Sacrifice.* Gr. adds, “of praise.” H.—This was the true spirit of the law. C.  
**6** *Lord.* The poor, who present a virtuous heart, are more acceptable than the rich, who are buried in sin, though the latter may offer the most splendid sacrifices. H.—God requires that all should do according to their abilities. If they have nothing, they must fulfill the commandments, and he will be satisfied. Some have inferred from Ex. 23:16 that the poor were rejected. But the meaning of the law is here explained. C.  
**10** *Heart.* Lit. “mind.” Gr. “eye,” ( H.) free from avarice. 2 Cor. 9:7.  
**11** *Sanctify:* “set apart” for the use of the ministers, and of the temple. C.—God will reward thee much more. W.  
**14** *Wicked;* defective. Lev. 22:21. Mal. 1:7. Gr. “curtailed, *or* ill-acquired,” ( C.) or “do not bribe” *God*; (δοροκοπει. Grot.) as the word is used 2 Mac. God will not regard our gifts, to let our offences escape punishment. Is. 42:1. C.  
**19** **V** **er.** **19** **.** *For*, &c. is not in Greek. God will protect the defenceless. H.  
**21** *He*, or “it.” C.—Prayer is personified, and presents itself before God.  
**22** *Them*, the *Gentiles*, &c. v. 23. Gr. “will not delay to *punish* them, till he crush the loins of the unmerciful. And,” &c. H.  
**23** *Unjust* Egyptians, Syrians, and Greeks, who then oppressed the Jews.  
**24** *Adam*, who was not spared. C.—Gr. “of men and their desires.” H.—Our version seems to be taken from the Heb. D.—*Adam* sometimes denotes any man. M.  
**26** *The.* Gr. “mercy is beautiful,” &c. Ps. 9:10. H.

## Chapter 36

**1** *Have.* He has pointed out the conditions for prayer, and now he gives a model. The Jews were at this time dispersed and subservient to the Egyptians or Syrians, which greatly afflicted them. C.—*And shew.* Gr. (2.) “send.”  
**2** *That.* Gr. Rom. omits the rest. But Grabe retains, “all nations which seek not after thee.” H.—This prayer implies a prediction of the Gentiles’ conversion, as the psalms do frequently in like terms. Ps. 64. W.  
**4** *Sanctified*, by chastising us, or by protecting our fathers in the desert.  
**10** *End* of our sufferings. The malice of our enemies is at the height.  
**11** *Escapeth* the sword. Deut. 32:36. He foretells the event, or wishes that they may be chastised, in order that they may enter into themselves, and adore the true God.  
**12** *Other* lord. The Syrian and Egyptian monarchs sometimes claimed divine honours. Dan. 7:25 and 11:36. C.  
**13** *That.* Gr. transposes the rest, and has only, *and thou*, &c. H.  
**14** *First-born.* Ex. 4:22. Wives, children, servants, were called after their lord or father. Is. 4:1 and 63:19. Jer. 7:10.  
**15** *Rest*, where the temple is built. 2 Par. 6:41. Ps. 131:8.  
**16** *Words*, predictions, as heretofore; or with thy favours.  
**18** *Thee.* The Jews were more faithful after the captivity. The author seems to beg for the coming of the Messias.  
**19** *People*, which thou hast prescribed. Num. 6:24. C.—*Direct.* Gr. “All shall know.”—*Art.* Gr. “Lord art the God of ages.” H.—Here the prayer ends. C.—The author continues to instruct. H.  
**20** *Another.* Thus act discreetly in the pursuit of knowledge. The good may be distinguished from bad, as easily as venison can from other meats. C.—As there is a difference of meats, so must discretion be used in words, in the choice of a wife, &c. W.  
**22** *Resist.* Gr. “requite it,” as it deserves. H.  
**23** *Man.* Yet in marriage the temper of the person is to be considered.  
**24** *More.* Love is the most violent of all the passions, and nothing can afford greater content than a virtuous and consoling wife. C. 26:21. C.  
**26** *Good*, is not in Greek, but the context shews that it is necessary. H.—By concord small possessions increase, as by discord the greatest are lost. W.  
**27** *Want.* If he be not so at first, servants will soon ruin his affairs.  
**28** *Rest*, or abode with his wife and family. The Jews in general married, and such as delayed were deemed suspicious characters. Prov. 27:8. C.  

---

## Chapter 37

**1** *Death.* Gr. explains this: ( C.) I mean (2.) “a companion and friend turned?” &c. H.—True friendship is most necessary, and false most dangerous. W.  
**5** *Will.* Grotius suspects that *not* is wanting. Yet, if a false friend take up arms, it will only be ( C.) for his own belly. M.—*Not* is ill-omitted in the Comp. edit. in the last part of the following verse.  
**7** *Snare.* Greek Rom. and Alex. has at the end ( C.) of v. 11, “with him that suspecteth thee.” H.  
**10** *Stake*, or stumbling-block. C.  
**12** *Treat not.* The negation is omitted in the Vulg. ( H.) which speaks ironically in the three following verses. Gr. “consult not with him who suspecteth thee, and hide thy counsel from those who are jealous of thee. With a woman,” &c. *Consult not*, is always understood. Among the Jews, polygamy occasioned much jealousy.—*Envious* miser. C.  
**13** *Nor.* Gr. “with the merciless concerning kindness, with the sluggard concerning any work. With one hired for the year, concerning coming to an end:” συντελειας. H.—He will never finish his work, or think he has sufficient wages.  
**15** *God*, and is enlightened, as well as a good friend, v. 16. C.  
**17** *It.* Gr. “more faithful than it,” the well regulated heart. H.—It will give the best counsel, if we be not guided by passion.  
**18** *Holy* is not in Gr. but must be understood. C.—The soul or heart, which is attentive to God, (v. 17) will be the best guide. H.—All good advice proceeds from the Lord. S. Aug. Doct. prol. 7.—We must always have recourse to him, though we must use our best endeavours. W.  
**20** *In* *.* Gr. “Reason is chief of every work, and counsel must go before every action.” H.—We must distrust our own lights.  
**21** *Them.* The heart gives birth to good or evil, which the tongue utters. Matt. 12:34 and 15:18.—*Soul.* What will science, without charity, profit him, if he should even gain the world? Matt. 16:26 and 1 Cor. 13:1.  
**23** *Hateful.* His sophisms are soon discovered. Gr. “there is one wise, hateful in his discourses: he shall be devoid of all wisdom.”  
**25** *Soul.* Being replenished with wisdom, he communicates it to others, and obtains an eternal reward. C.  
**28** *But.* Gr. “And.” The wisest must soon die: Even the race of Israel shall end: But the virtuous shall be for ever remembered. v. 29. H.—The blessed in heaven live for ever. W.  
**30** *Life.* Attempt nothing above thy strength: or Gr. try *what agrees with* thy *health or* soul, ( C.) and see thou give it not what is hurtful to it.” H.—S. Paul (1 Cor. 11) exhorts every one to prove or try himself and his own conscience. W.  
**31** *Soul.* “We must not dispute about tastes.” H.—They are as various as men’s faces. All conditions do not suit every person.  
**33** *Choler*, or indigestion. “Gluttony has slain more than the sword.” C.  

---

## Chapter 38

**1** *Honour* and pay. Prov. 8:9. C.—Gr. adds, “with his fees.” H.—The health of body and soul must be regarded. W.  
**2** *King.* Physicians were formerly kept at the king’s expense. Pliny xxix. 1.  
**4** *Them*, as he will all superstitious remedies. C.—“A crowd of physicians killed Cæsar,” said Adrian, on his death-bed. They often try experiments, and kill with impunity. Pliny xxix. 1.—Yet we must not condemn the prudent use of medicine. C.  
**5** *Wood*, of various sorts. Grot.—Many suppose that he alludes to the miracle of Moses, (Ex. 15:25) who thus was supernaturally informed ( C.) of the effects of a certain wood. T. M. S. Aug. q. lvii. in Ex.  
**6** *The.* Gr. “that his *or* its virtue might be known by man.”  
**7** *These* plants.—*And of.* Gr. “Of these the maker of ointments shall compose a mixture and his works are not yet finished, when peace (*health*) from him appears on the face of the earth.” H.—Disease flee before him; so powerful are his medicines, that the very smell effects a cure.  
**9** *Thee.* We must neither trust too much in physicians, (2 Par. 16:12) nor despise them, as this would be tempting God.  
**10** *Sin.* All diseases are in consequence of original sin, and may are inflicted for actual transgressions. Jo. 9:2 and 1 Cor. 11:30. Num. 12:10. C.  
**11** *Then.* Gr. “as being no longer. Yet give,” &c. H.—Be converted and offer sacrifice, as if there were no hopes of life. Still do not despair. C.  
**13** *Thou.* Gr. “a sweet smell (*success*) *shall be* in their hands.” H.  
**15** *Physician.* This state is very troublesome, and a punishment of sin. v. 10.  
**16** *Burial.* Thus we must shew our respect for the deceased. The Jews also prayed for them. 2 Mac. 12:42. C.—“The care … and pomp of funerals are rather the consolations of survivors than of service to the dead.” S. Aug. cura 2.  
**17** *For.* Gr. “and shed burning tears of mourning, (18) and lament for,” &c. H.—Sorrow would be unsuitable for the saints, and useless for the damned, who being rebellious to God do not deserve our lamentations. Yet nature dictates, and people expect we should allow something to the first emotions of sorrow, ( C.) for a day or two; and we may receive the consolatory visits of our friends, during the seven days of mourning. C. 22:13. Jo. 11:19. S. Paulin. ad Pam.—To avoid the evil reports of men, we must shew ourselves to be really sorry; yet we must not suffer grief to hurt our health. W.  
**19** *And the*, &c. is not in Greek. Excessive sorrow brings on sickness, and renders us unfit for any thing.  
**20** *Aside*, in solitude.—*Substance;* or what the poor has to live on, will seem sweet or bitter according as he is affected with joy or grief.  
**21** *End.* This is the chief utility derived from attending funerals.  
**23** *Thee.* A man on his death-bed, or already dead, is introduced speaking. C.  
**24** *Him.* Gr. “thyself.” He is at rest, we hope; ( H.) be thou so too. C.  
**25** *A scribe;* that is, a doctor of the law, or a learned man. Ch.—Sorrow ( H.) and too much employment, are injurious to learning. C.—*Sapientiæ otia negotia sunt* *.* S. Bern. ser. 85. Cant.—When pastors have leisure, they would do well to write, in imitation of S. Paul, &c. W.  
**28** *Work:* engraving on gold, or silver, or on precious stones.  
**29** *Sitting.* Such was the ancient custom of smiths, ( C.) who carried all their implements with them, and laboured with much pain. Chardin.  
**34** *Glazing.* The earthen vessel would otherwise spoil all but oil and water. C.  
**37** *Dwell.* Gr. “travel,” to get a livelihood, (Grot.) or to acquire wisdom, (C. 34:9 and 39:5) and *walk about* like the ancient philosophers. They shall not be chosen magistrates. C.  
**38** *Spoken.* They have not leisure to attend the lectures of sages; ( H.) nor are they ever quoted by them.  
**39** *World*, giving children to the commonwealth, ( M.) and employing themselves in useful arts. The Jews would not allow magicians, players, &c. to reside in their country.—*Craft.* They pray that they may succeed in their employment, while some also strive to comply with their religious duties. C.—*Applying.* Gr. refers this to the following chapter, “As for him who applies his soul and meditates on the law of the Most High, he will,” &c. H.  

---

## Chapter 39

**1** *Ancients.* The Essenes (Jos. Bel. i. 7.) and Therapeuts (Philo. Comtemp.) were most famous of all for doing so. In general the Jews despise the learning of foreign nations: but some have applied themselves to it, particularly Philo, Josephus, &c. 1 Mac. 1:11 and 2 Mac. 6:11.—*Prophets.* These required the utmost study, before the coming of Christ. 1 Pet. 1:11. Dan. 9:9. C.—The virtuous must follow both an active and contemplative life. W.

**4** *Governor* or the province or army. The most enlightened were chosen, like Joseph. Daniel 1:4. &c.  
**5** **V** **er.** **5** **.** *Men.* Travelling was very requisite, (C. 34:11) and history records the actions of the bad as well as the good, for the instruction of the public.  
**6** *Pray.* Diligence and prayer are the means to acquire wisdom. C. 4:13.  
**9** *Lord*, being in a sort of rapture, and enlightened by Him.  
**13** *Generation.* With what care de we not preserve the Scripture? &c.  
**15** *Thousand.* Children or other men.—*Rest*, in death. C.  
**16** *With.* Gr. “as the moon in the first quarter,” διχομηνια. H.—The Vulg. has read διχομηνια, “divine transport.” The author declares that he was inspired. C.  
**17** *By.* Gr. “Hear me, ye holy children.”—*Offspring.* Lit. “fruits.” H.—He speaks to the children of Israel, the people of God: whom he exhorts to bud forth and flourish with virtue. Ch.  
**19** *Bring.* Gr. “praise a canticle.”  
**20** *Voice.* Gr. “songs of your lips, ( H.) and with ancient lyres,” &c. C.  
**22** *Waters.* At the world’s creation, or at the passage of the Israelites. C.

**28** *That.* Gr. “as he changed the waters into saltness,” ( H.) *at Sodom*, ( C.) “his ways are plain for the saints: so to sinners they are stumbling-blocks.” v. 30. The Red Sea gave a passage to Israel, and overwhelmed the Egyptians. H.—*Him.* God does all with grandeur. He poured his graces upon Israel, and overwhelmed the giants in the deluge. C.  
**30** *Good and*, is omitted in Gr. Before the fall, all was happiness. Now, the wicked have still some mixture of good. v. 32. Bossuet.  
**31** *Water and fire.* These are requisite to prepare bread. The Romans refused them to the enemies of the state.—*Cluster.* Gr. “blood,” as Deut. 32:14. C.—God gives the necessaries of life, which the virtuous use well, for their reward; and the wicked ill, to their ruin. W.  
**32** *Evil.* The good or bad use of them decides all. Wisd. 14:11. Rom. 8:18. Tit. 1:15.  
**33** *Spirits.* Storms (Ps. 10:7 and 148:8) good angels, (Gen. 19:11. Is. 37:36) or rather devils: who, though created in holiness, fell, and became executioners of the wicked. C.—They abused their free-will, and are eternally punished. W.  
**34** *Destruction*, and final ruin of the impious, or at the least day. C.—*Appease.* God is pleased with the execution of justice.

**39** *Time* *.* If we receive not at first, we must have patience.  
**40** *That.* Even sin contributes to manifest the justice and mercy of God; and we are not to judge of his works, but to praise him; as every thing is created for wise purposes, and evil proceeds from our abuse of things. C.

## Chapter 40

**1** *Labour*, “anxiety,” ασχολια. M.—All misery ( C.) is in consequence of original sin. W.—The life of man is *a trial.* Job 7:1 and 14:1.—*Of all.* The earth, ( C.)

**16** *Weed.* Lit. “verdure.” Gr. Achei, ( H.) properly denotes the rush, *papyrus*, which grows on the banks of the Nile, (Gen. 41:2. C.) and was used for fuel. Alpin. i. 7. Matt. 6:30.—Thus the wicked will presently ( C.) be treated. M.

**18** *That is.* Gr. “and of one that.”—*In it.* Gr. “and more than both is one discovering a treasure,” ( H.) who finds himself rich, without labour or injustice.  
**19** *Both.* Thus Judith, Zenobia, &c. ennobled their husbands. Prov. 31:10.  
**20** *Wisdom.* Virtue gives more content to the soul than corporal pleasures do to the body. It brings us near to God. C.  
**22** *Green.* “The sight of no colour is more agreeable to the eyes.” Pliny xxxvii. 1.—The Church is more excellent than the synagogue. W.  
**23** *Husband.* Their union is closer, and they can best assist each other.  
**25** *Coun* *sel.* By this the Romans conquered the world. 1 Mac. 8:31. Prov. 11:14.

C.—Plato (Leg. 11.) orders magistrates to “clear the country of such an animal,” ζωου, ( H.) and the Lacedemonians suffered no beggars among them.

## Chapter 41

**1** *Death* is terrible to all, but most to those who live comfortably. C.—*O vita misero longa, felici brevis* *.* Sen.  
**3** *Sentence*, pronounced on Adam and all his posterity. C.  
**5** **V** **er.** **5** **.** *Flesh.* “It is a great consolation to share the fate of all.” Sen. Provid. v.  
**6** *What.* Gr. “why wouldst thou refuse to submit to the?” &c. H.  
**7** *Life.* Thou wilt not be asked how long, but how well thou hast lived. No one will then envy thy long life. C.—It will be in vain to plead that the length or shortness of life has occasioned thy sins; for God does all with justice and for the best, if men would use rightly his benefits. W.—Thou wilt not repine at having lived too short a time. M.—An evil life will be alone condemned. Wisd. v. D.  
**8** *Ungodly.* They adopt the wicked manners of their parents ( C.) and companions, and thus become still more criminal. H.  
**10** *Father.* He is rather their executioner, ( C.) and would have been less cruel, if he had murdered them while they were innocent. Wisd. 12:10. H.  
**12** *Portion.* It would have been better for them never to have existed. Mat. 26:24. This the case of heresiarchs. C.  
**13** *From.* Gr. “go to destruction.” H.—It is their destination (C. 40:11. C.) and choice. H.  
**14** *Body.* The death of the body is bewailed in the just, but that of the soul also of wicked people calls for our tears. They will soon perish. Ps. 9:7.  
**15** *Great.* The concern which all have for a good name, is one of the strongest proofs of the souls’ immortality. Prov. 22:11.  
**17** *Peace*, with docility, (Mat. 11:25) or in the midst of prosperity, be on your guard. C. 20:32. C.  
**19** *Have a shame*, &c. That is to say, be ashamed of doing any of these things, which I am now going to mention: for though sometimes shamefacedness is not to be indulged, yet it is often good and necessary; as in the following cases. Ch.—Disciples ought to esteem what their masters teach, though they do not perceive the reasonableness of what they assert. W.  
**20** *Opinion.* Grotius corrects the Gr. “It is not laudable to be incredulous in all.”  
**21** *Mother.* Thy misconduct seems to redound to their dishonour, as if they had not given thee a proper education.  
**22** *People.* They will stone thee. Remember the fate of Roboam. 3 K. 12. C.  
**24** *And of.* Lit. “out of respect for the,” &c. *De veritate Dei & testam* *ento* *.* H.—The same words occur C. 42:2.; whence Jansenius thinks they have been transferred hither. Most refer them to what goes before. Blush for lying, which is contrary to the truth of God; and for the other sins which injure his covenant.—*Meat.* This posture betrays idleness or pride.  
**25** *Harlot.* The eyes must be chaste. Jer. 9:21. Mat. 5:28.—*Kinsman*, when he is poor, and refusing to assist him. C.  
**26** *Turn.* Gr. “of taking away a portion and gift,” made already to God or men; (27) “of considering attentively another’s wife; of being too busy about his,” &c. H.

## Chapter 42

**1** *Men.* Here the Gr. concludes the former chapter very properly, ( H.) as we must be ashamed of doing these things, and not of those which follow. C.—“Of repeating [and] of the speech which thou hast heard, and of revealing secret words; (things. H.) and thou shalt be truly bashful, (αισχυντηρος. C.) and find favour with every man.” Grabe’s edit. H.—*Thereby.* In such cases we must shew a holy impudence, like Jeremias, 1:10. 18.  
**2** *Covenant.* We must be ashamed of transgressing these, (C. 41:24) but not of complying with them. This is the first duty of man.—*Ungodly.* Blush not to oppose such a judgment, ( C.) though all the judges should be against thee. Follow no collusion of man to do evil. H.—Pass sentence without respect of persons, (Deut. 1:16. C.) whether the parties be thy companions, or only travellers. v. 3. H.  
**3** *Friends.* Be not ashamed to leave something to thy friends, though relations may grumble; or execute thy friend’s will exactly. C.  
**4** *Little.* Be scrupulously exact in thy dealings, but not afraid of advancing thy fortune by lawful means.  
**5** *Buying.* This regards magistrates, who must correct such frauds. Gr. “of the money ( C.) to purchase from merchants.” H.—We may examine whether the coin by good, and strive to get things as cheap as we can.—*Bleed.* Great severity was formerly used. C. 30:12. C.  
**6** *Keeping.* Lit. “a seal.” H.—All must be locked up.  
**7** *In.* Not out of distrust so much, as to keep servants honest. All who have written on economy give the same rules.  
**8** *Men.* So Daniel discovered the malice of the two ancients. Dan. 13:46. Admonish the aged not to enter into disputes, or strive with the young. C.  
**9** *Knoweth.* Lit. “*who is* hidden.” H.—An unmarried woman was styled *Halma*, or “hidden.” Is. 7:11. C.—*Pass away.* Gr. “abuse.” H.—Some read *adultera*, (Sixt. V. Jans.) instead of *adulta*, improperly. It was deemed shameful for a parent not to have his daughter married soon. 1 Cor. 7:36.—*Hateful.* Deut. 24.  
**10** *Barren.* And thus fall into contempt. Deut. 7:14. If she committed adultery she must die; or if she were only suspected, she must drink the waters of jealousy. Num. 5:17. Husbands would often seek a divorce, on such occasions; which would involve the father in fresh difficulties.  
**11** *Multitude*, who will accuse thee of negligence. C.  
**12** *Body’s.* Lit. “man’s.” But females are included in this term. H.—It was also necessary to guard the Greeks, and pagans in general, against a criminal affection for boys.  
**13** *Man.* Gr. “woman.” Malice is natural to her. Beauty becomes her ruin, as well as that of others. C.—The Fathers compare women to a load-stone. S. Bas.—Men who come near them, are greatly exposed. C.  
**14** *Better*, &c. That is, there is, commonly speaking, less danger to be apprehended to the soul from the churlishness, or injuries we receive from men, than from the flattering favours and familiarity of women. Ch.—Josephus (c. Ap. ii.) attributes this sentence to Moses, and prefers the worst man to the best woman, as Euripides does in Clem. Strom. iv. C.—But this is ridiculous.—*Reproach.* This explains what sort of *good* the woman aforesaid has done; she had fostered the passions of men, and brought them to shame, which all the malevolence of an enemy could not have done. H.—The company of women is therefore more dangerous. C. 9. W.  
**15** *Re* *member*, or publish. He praises God and the great men of his nation, to the end of the book, ( C.) or to C. 50:29. H.—*By.* Lit. “in.” H.—I have only abridged what the sacred Scriptures relate.  
**16** *W* *ork.* The world displays God’s glory and power. Ps. 18:6.  
**17** *Saints*, in heaven, or rather the Israelites. Ps. 147:20. C.  
**19** *Signs.* Lit. “sign,” the order of the stars, &c. H.—Yet God does not study these things, to discover what will happen. He is the author of nature. C.—From his works we are to form some idea of his greatness. Job 28. &c. W.  
**25** *Another.* By this opposition the world subsists, according to Linus, Epimenides, &c. *Hanc Deus et melior litem natura diremit* *.* Met. i. See C. 23:16.  
**26** *He.* Gr. “one thing establishes the good of another,” ( H.) serving as a counterpoise. C.—Black colours cause the white to shine forth. Youth is guided by the experience of old age. M.

## Chapter 43

**1** *Shew.* We cannot behold these things without admiration of God.  
**2** *High.* The sun is the most excellent of all irrational creatures, affording light ( W.) and heat for the production of things; ( H.) whence Aristotle (de Anima ii.) styles it “father of men and of gods.” Yet it is inferior to man, being devoid of reason. All creatures manifest God’s majesty; the little as well as the great. W.  
**5** *Hastened.* Some Gr. copies read “slackened,” alluding to Jos. 10:13.  
**6** *In all.* Gr. Comp. “to stand guard.” Other copies agree with the Vulg. though embarrassed.—*Wor* *ld.* To mark out the seasons. Gen. 1:14. Ps. 103:19.  
**7** *Day.* The lunar system prevailed only after the captivity. The Passover was celebrated on the 14th of the moon of Nisan.  
**8** *Name.* Meni is used for the moon, (Jer. 52:11.) which resembles the Gr. mén, “month.” This is also derived from *méné*, “the moon.” We know not what Heb. words were used. C. 6:23. The two former may both come from *m* *anah*, “to divide.”  
**9** *Armies.* The stars, &c. are compared to a camp or army.  
**11** *Judgment.* The angels are not pure before God; (Job 4:18 and 15:15) or rather the stars obey his orders. Bar. 3:34. Judg. 5:20. Ps. 118:91. C.  
**12** *Brightness. Mille trahit varios adverso sole colores* *.* Æn. 5.  
**14** *Judgment*, to punish the wicked. Ex. 14:24. Is. 37:36. C.  
**15** *Birds*, sent to give information by letters, as the Egyptians still do. Bochart i. 2. Is. 60:5.—Tempests execute God’s judgments. Job 38:22.  
**16** *Broken*, as from huge mountains. Job 38:39. C.  
**18** *Strike.* Gr. “upbraid, (Drus.) or make the earth fall in labour,” *odinesen* *.* Grabe. H.  
**19** *Lightning.* Gr. “flying, he.” H.—*Locusts.* “They cover the cornfields with a destructive cloud.” Pliny xi. 29.  
**20** *Shower*, as if God were about to drown the world. The melting of snow occasions dreadful inundations. C.—Its whiteness sometimes deprives people of their sight. Xenoph. Anab. iv.  
**21** *Thistles.* Gr. “stakes,” pointed as it were with steel. M.  
**22** *Crystal*, or ice. C.  
**23** *Burn.* Cold destroys verdure no less than fire. Gen. 31:40.  
**24** *Overpower it.* Gr. “give joy; (25) with,” &c. H.—Warmth and rain restore beauty to the earth, after the horrors of winter.  
**25** *Still.* Lit. “silent.” Matt. 8:26.—*Lord.* Gr. Rom. “Jesus planted it;” which is a mistake for νησους, *islands.* C.—“He planted islands in it.” Grabe thus corrects the Alex. copy, though it agree with the Rom. and Aldine editions. H.  
**26** *Thereof.* Ps. 106:23. “He who has not sailed has seen nothing evil.” Possidip.  
**27** *Monstrous.* Gr. “creation of whales.” H.  
**28** *Is.* Gr. “his angel gives a prosperous journey.”—*Regulated.* Gr. “blended.” H.—If God be angry, all will go to the bottom. Grot.  
**29** *All.* Lit. “in all.” Every thing obeys God. C. 42:15. Eccle. 12:13.  
**30** *Him.* So the Gr. reads. Vulg. seems to say, “boasting in all, what shall we be able to do?” What is man, fighting against the Lord! C.  
**32** **Ver** **.** **32** **.** *His.* Gr. “exalting the Lord, exert your power; and labour, for you will not come up to him: (35) who,” &c. H.—He is above all praise. Ps. 144:3. C.  
**35** *From.* Gr. “many hidden things are,” &c. H.—The angels, and many secrets of nature, have not been mentioned. C.

## Chapter 44

**1** Gr. prefixes, “A Hymn of the Fathers.” The author here imitates the third work of Solomon. H.—He had given rules for all virtues; and he now sets before us those who had put them in practice. C.—It was the custom to sound forth the praises of these fathers in the temple and synagogues. v. 15. Grot.  
**2** *Glory.* Gr. adds, “in them.” He was the author of all their virtues, ( H.) and has acquired much glory by their means, ( C.) among men; though his essential glory can never increase.  
**3** *In the.* Gr. “*futurity* by *their* predictions.” Kings, judges, and prophets are praised. H.—The virtuous are justly styled kings. Gen. 23. W.  
**4** *The present.* Gr. “the people by counsels, and by the knowledge of the office of scribes of the people. Wise in speech by their instruction. (5.) Seeking out,” &c. H.—Prudence and eloquence ought to appear in a ruler.  
**5** *Tunes.* The Hebrews, and David in particular, were famous for music. C.  
**6** *In.* Gr. “established in power, living,” &c. ( H.) like Abraham, Ezechias, &c. C.  
**7** *Generations.* Lit. “race *of their nation.*” But this is omitted in Greek.  
**8** *Born.* Gr. “some of them have left a name,” ( H.) or posterity. Deut. 25:6.  
**9** *Them.* This may be understood of the wicked Israelites, or of the sons of Abraham by Agar, &c.  
**10** *Mercy.* Assideans, (1 Par. 6:41 and 1 Mac. 7:13) or true Israelites.  
**14** **4** **.** *Peace.* The Jews were very solicitous about this. Gen. 35:8. C.  
**16** *Into.* Gr. “a model of penance to *past or future* generations.” H.—The Latin fathers suppose that Henoch was translated to heaven, or to the earthly paradise. It is the tradition both of Jews and Christians that he is still alive, and will come to oppose Antichrist, (Apoc. 11:3. Gen. 5:22. Heb. 11:5. C.) when he will preach penance, ( W.) chiefly to the Gentiles, while Elias will address himself to the Jews. H.  
**17** *A.* Gr. “an exchange,” to save mankind. Gen. 6:8 and 8:21. C.—Noe was *perfect*, ( W.) which does not exclude some human failings. H.  
**20** *Multitude.* His name implies as much. C.—He was father of all who believed in Christ. W.  
**21** *Faithful.* He received the sign of circumcision, and was ready to sacrifice Israel. C.  
**22** *In his.* Gr. “that the nations should be blessed in his posterity.”—*Dust.* Lit. “a heap.” H. Gen. 12:2 and 22:17.  
**23** *Earth.* In Arabia, and from the Red Sea to the Euphrates. This was verified in David. Ps. 71. Gen. 13:14.  
**25** *Jacob.* The promises made to Abraham were confirmed to Isaac and Jacob. H.—These were also blessed in Abraham. W.  
**26** *Tribes.* Giving him so many children, who inherited Chanaan.  
**27** *Men.* The Israelites. v. 10. Gr. “the man,” Joseph; though the Gr. of the Rom. edit. would refer it to Moses. C.—Grabe corrects his copy agreeably to the Vulg. H.  

---

## Chapter 45

**1** *Men.* Pharao, Jethro, and the whole nation of the Hebrews, whom he governed as a father, being the *mildest* of men. Num. 12:2–3. His life was a continued miracle, and he was honoured more than any prophet, (ib. 6. Acts 7. C.) seeing God’s works more clearly, but not his substance. Ex. 33. W.  
**2** *Saints*, patriarchs or angels, as he saw God face to face.—*Enemies.* The Egyptians, Amalecites, and all who rebelled against God.—*Cease.* Removing the scourges which he had inflicted. His serpent devoured those of the magicians, who were confounded before him.  
**3** *Kings.* Pharao, Og, &c.—*Glory*, when he had passed by. Ex. 33:22.  
**4** *Meekness*, giving him these necessary qualifications to rule a rebellious people. v. 1.  
**5** *Heard.* Gr. “made him hear his voice.”  
**6** *Face*, familiarly.—*Life*, by observing which, the Hebrews might live. Thus the trees of life and of knowledge were a sort of remedy against death and ignorance. Gen. 2:9. C.  
**7** *His.* Gr. “holy, like to himself his brother of the,” &c. H. Ps. 105:16.—He was the interpreter of Moses, and honoured with the high priesthood. Aaron and his posterity were bound to be faithful to the law. v. 19. C.—Their priesthood was to last till Christ appeared, a priest forever of the order of Melchisedech.  
**9** *Robe.* Lit. “stole,” ( H.) which was a long robe, used in the East by both sexes.—*Crowned.* Gr. “confirmed” him in his dignity. C.  
**10** *To the.* Gr. “enclosing his legs, ( H. *breeches.* C.) and the robe hanging down to the feet, (*poderé*) and the garment over the shoulders,” ( H. *ephod*) which met at the breast, where the rational were fixed. See Ex. 28. C.—*Many.* Gr. “spheres, ( H. or pomegranates. Ex. 28:23. C.) with many little bells,” ( H.) to admonish the people of his coming.  
**12** *Man.* Beseleel, who made the greatest part. C.—Gr. “of an embroiderer, with the rational of judgment, and the signs (*manifestation.* C.) of truth. H.—Thus the Sept. commonly describe the Urim and Thummim. Ex. 28:6. C.  
**13** *Tribes.* Gr. “sons.” H.—Their names were engraven on 12 stones.  
**14** *Holiness*, or “holy to the Lord.” Ex. 28. C.—*Work.* Gr. “works very rich.” H.—This regards all his attire. The high priest only used it in the temple, on grand festivals. C.  
**17** *His.* Gr. Comp. “their.” H.—Some of the ordinary priests offered the daily holocausts.  
**18** *Filled.* Consecrated. Lev. 8:26.  
**19** **V** **er.** **19** **.** *Testament.* It prefigured that of Christ, which lasts for ever. Heb. 7. C.—*Execute.* Gr. “serve him, both by executing the priestly office, and by blessing the people,” &c. H.—This was one of the high priest’s functions. Num. 6:23. The rest might offer sacrifice and incense, except on the day of expiation, (Lev. 16) and on solemn festivals, though the Scripture is silent on the latter head.  
**21** *Law.* The most important causes were to be tried before the high priest, who, with this brethren, were the interpreters of the law. Matt. 2:6.  
**24** *Fire.* Thus consuming 250 men. Num. 16:30.  
**26** *Eat.* The skin of holocausts were along given to the priests.  
**27** *People.* Having only 2,000 cubits round their cities. Num. 35. The priests were thus interested to keep the people to their duty, as their own subsistence depended on the devotion and gifts of the latter. C.—They had no distinct territory, like the rest of the tribes. W.  
**28** *Imitating.* Gr. “by shewing a zeal in the fear of the Lord.” Num. 25:11.  
**31** *That he.* Or so he made a covenant with Aaron, *that he*, &c. C.—Gr. “and (Grabe puts *according to*) the covenant made to David … that the king’s son successively should alone inherit, the inheritance of Aaron was for his posterity. May he impart wisdom to your heart,” &c.—*He made.* Gr. “glory during their age.” H.—The sacred writer pours forth this prayer for God’s ministers, ( C.) that their *good things and glory* may never end, as long as the Jewish dispensation should last. He is equally solicitous for the priesthood as for the sceptre of David. In both the families of Aaron and David children succeeded to their father’s dignity, and God had made a covenant for that purpose. H.—David assisted the priests, and greatly advanced God’s service. 1 Par. 23. W.—His eulogy is given C. 47; and he is here only mentioned ( C.) as a comparison. H.

## Chapter 46

**1** *Jesus, the son of Nave.* So Josue is named in the Greek Bibles. For *Josue* and *Jesus* signify the same thing, viz. *a Saviour;* ( Ch.) and *Nave* is the Greek pronunciation of Nun; ( H.) or this is an old fault of transcribers. C.—*Among.* Gr. “in the prophecies.” H.—He was endued with the prophetic spirit, and was raised up by God as a noble figure of the great prophet. Deut. 18:15. C.—He succeeded Moses in the temporal power; the spiritual belonged to the sons of Aaron. Num. 27. W.  
**2** *Israel.* He led the people into Chanaan, and divided it among them.  
**3** *Hands.* To pray, (Vat.) or fight, (Boss.) or to give a signal. Jos. 8:26. A. Lap.—*Stretched.* Literally, threw ( H.) darts, *romphœas* *.*  
**4** *The.* Gr. “he conducted the wars of the Lord.” C.—Other edit. agree with us.  
**5** *In.* Gr. “by his hand,” ( H.) and order, so that the day-light continued 24 hours.  
**7** *Adversaries.* The hail destroyed more than the sword. Jos. 10:11.  
**8** *Power.* Gr. “complete armour for his warfare was before the Lord, since he,” &c. They found it was impossible to resist such weapons. H.—*One.* “Follow God,” was a maxim of the ancient sages, which they even attributed to Apollo. Josue and Caleb did so in opposition to the rebels. Num. 14:24. C.—The rest all perished, ( W.) if we except those who were not 20 years old, or who did not join in the murmurs of the seditious. H.  
**9** *Mercy*, and piety, ( C.) endeavouring to prevent the murmurs of the people, which would draw upon them destruction, as the event shewed. H.  
**11** *Land.* Hebron, when he was 85 years old. Jos. 14:6. H.  
**13** *Lord.* Abimelec must be excepted, ( C.) as he was only an usurper. H.—The Judges were all saved, though some have been great sinners. W.  
**14** *Place.* At the resurrection, which the Jews firmly believed. Ezec. 27:3.  
**16** *People.* Though he disapproved of their resolution. 1 K. 8:6. Os. 13:11.  
**17** *And the.* Sixt. V. &c. read, “and he beheld the God.” 1 K. 3:7. C.—Vulg. may signify also, “God beheld Jacob,” (Gr.) with a favourable eye, and enabled Samuel to restore their fallen state, and to recover the ark. H.  
**18** *Because.* Gr. has not *faithful*, or what follows. C.—Yet Grabe’s copy retains πιστος ορασεως, “faithful in seeing” into futurity; so that his predictions were always verified, and he acquired the confidence of all. 1 K. 3:20. Prophets were former styled *see* *rs:* yet they could not behold God, as he *inhabits light inaccessible.* 1 Tim. 6:16. H.—*Light.* S. James (1:17) seems to allude to this passage. M.  
**19** *Without.* Gr. “fed with milk.” 1 K. 7:6. The Philistines were discomfited, and continued peaceable during the rest of Samuel’s government.  
**21** *Tyrians*, who were auxiliaries, or in league with the Philistines. C.  
**22** *Shoe.* So Abraham declared he would not receive the latchet of a shoe from the king of Sodom. Gen. 14:23.—*Him.* All confessed his integrity, before he delivered up the sovereign power to Saul. 1 K. 12.  
**23** *Nation.* Foretelling that Israel should be defeated. Some doubt whether the soul of Samuel appeared; but it seems clear from this passage, (1 K. 28:18. C. Diss.) as he could not otherwise be praised for it. W.

## Chapter 47

**1** *Nathan.* Many other prophets lived at the same time. But he was most conspicuous, and crowned Solomon. C.—Gr. “and after him Nathan arose to prophesy,” ( H.) and keep up the succession.  
**2** *Flesh.* Gr. “peace-offering.” The fat was deemed most delicate.  
**3** *Played.* Tearing them to pieces with the greatest ease. 1 K. 17:34. C.  
**6** *Nation.* Who were no longer under the control of the Philistines. H.  
**7** *Thousand.* This was sung in the cities, (1 K. 18:7. C.) and excited the envy of Saul, who nevertheless could not prevent David’s exaltation. H.—*Did he*, or the people who praised the Lord and David. C.  
**8** *Horn.* Power and glory. H.—*For ever*, is not in Gr. David defeated the Philistines at the beginning of his reign. C.  
**9** *Glory.* Contained in the Psalms. H.—He was always very grateful. C.—His pure and sincere heart pleased God more than his other works. W.  
**11** *Altar.* Of holocausts. Moses had not appointed singing.  
**12** *Set.* Lit. “adorned the times.”—*Of his.* Gr. “while they praised his holy name, and sounded forth holiness early.” H.—David strove to give all perfection to the sacred ceremonies of religion, that the people might be attracted to the tabernacle, ( C.) and serve the Lord with gladness. H.  
**13** *Sins.* Remitting the punishment, (2 K. 12:13. C.) and the guilt also, ( H.) in consequence of his repentance.—*Covenant.* Engaging that his posterity should enjoy the throne (2 K. 7:12. C.) if they continued faithful. Ps. 131:11 sup.c. 45:31.  
**14** *Enemies.* The piety of David was thus rewarded. H.—It must have been the greatest satisfaction to him, to see so wise a son on the throne, and all in perfect peace. 3 K. 1:48 and 4:24. C.—These blessings were a reward of his virtue. W.  
**15** *Youth.* When other are less informed. This serves to place the apostacy of Solomon in a more striking light. C.—The author seems astonished both at the wisdom and at the folly of this prince, ( H.) and apostrophises him. W.  
**16** *Earth.* Or explored all the secrets of nature, *retexit* *.* 3 K. 4:29.  
**18** *Interpretations* of riddles. Hence people praised the Lord. 3 K. 10:24.  
**20** *Copper*, (*aurichalcum* *.*) Gr. “tin.” 2 Par. 9:13.  
**21** *Thyself.* Lit. “thy thighs.” Gr. “sides.” Syr. “strength.”—*Subjection.* Lit. “thou hadst power over thy body,” ( H.) using it as if it belonged not to God. He was guilty of excess in marrying a thousand wives, and yielding to idolatry, ( C.) fearing to displease those whom he loved to his own ruin.” S. Aug. de Gen. ad lit. xi. 42.—Dreadful infatuation! H.  
**22** *Defiled.* Consecrating some even to Moloch, (Pineda vii. 11.) or having children by those whom the law prohibited. Deut. 7:2 and 23:2. C.—His sins were punished: yet God’s mercy preserved his posterity. W. Ps. 88.  
**23** *Reb* *ellious.* (Gr.) Lit. “hard.” H.—Jeroboam was at the head of it. 3 K. 12:14. C.  
**24** *Lord.* David’s piety caused the sceptre to be still preserved in his family, ( H.) though Solomon’s conduct deserved to lose it. C.  
**25** *Of the.* Gr. “a root from him,” to govern a part, while Jeroboam reigned over the other tribes of Jacob. H.—God fulfilled his promises to Jacob and David. M.  
**26** *Fathers.* Some would hence infer, that Solomon died penitent. H.  
**27** *Folly.* A most imprudent prince, despised by the whole nation. He answered the people roughly, and lost the ten tribes; but idolatry was his greatest folly, and from this he was never reclaimed. 3 K. 14:22. C.  
**29** *Jeroboam.* Though not of his seed, as we only find Roboam mentioned of all the thousand wives of Solomon. *He left behi* *nd him* Jeroboam, notwithstanding his desire to have him slain; and this man brought ruin on the nation. H.—*Sin.* This is the usual title given to this introducer of idolatry. He engaged the ten tribes in the worship of the golden calves, which ruined the state and religion of Israel.  
**31** *Vengeance*, (*defensio*) *and put*, &c. in not in Gr. Theglatphalasar and Salmanasar carried the tribes away into captivity. 1 Par. 5:26 and 4 K. 14. 17:6. C.—Many hereupon opened their eyes, ( M.) as we may hope. Those who returned with the rest of the Jews relapsed not, at least into idolatry, in such an open manner. H.

## Chapter 48

**1** *Torch.* He was animated with a burning zeal, ( M.) like John the Baptist, admonishing kings, &c. Jo. 5:35. Lu. 1:17. C.  
**2** *And they.* Gr. “and by his zeal he diminished them. By,” &c. H.—He slew the priests of Baal, and many perished by famine. 4 K. 18. Grot. C.  
**3** *Heaven.* That it should not rain for three years and a-half. 3 K. 17:1.—*Thrice.* First upon his sacrifice, and twice to destroy fifty soldiers. Ib. 18 and 4 K. 1:10. C. W.  
**5** *Man.* The son of the widow of Sarepta.  
**6** *Destruction.* The prophets are said to perform what they foretell; to indicate the certainty of the event. Elias denounced death to Achab, Jezabel, Ochozias, and the two Jorams. 4 K. 9:12 and 2 Par. 21:12. &c. C.—*Brokest.* Gr. “those in honour from,” &c. alluding to ( H.) Ochozias and Joram. 4 K. 1:16 and 1 Par. 21:15. C.  
**7** *Judgment.* Gr. “the reprimand of the Lord,” for betraying fear, (3 K. 19:3. 9. 12. H.) or the reprimand regarded Israel. C.  
**8** *Penance.* Gr. “reward,” ( H.) or punish the guilty. Hazael and Jehu were anointed by Eliseus, though by order of Elias.—*Thee.* Eliseus was called from the plough, and adhered to his master, who governed the sons of the prophets in large communities.  
**10** *Jacob.* Prot. reject the authority of this book, partly ( H.) on account of this ( W.) ancient tradition. Enoch and Elias will appear in the days of antichrist, to convert many. The Jews will then agree with the Patriarchs, and embrace the religion of Christ. C.—Elias came in the person of John the Baptist, at the first coming of our Saviour, but he will come in person before his second appearance. H.—The application which Christ makes of the prediction of Malachy (4:6) to the Baptist, does not exclude this more distant accomplishment. Elias is still alive in some part of the world, as well as Enoch, whom S. Aug. styled “the first-born (*primogenitor*) of our resurrection.” De Civ. Dei. xv. 19. 4 K. 2:11.  
**11** *Friendship.* Like Eliseus, or the disciples of both. C.—Gr. “who slept in love, for we also shall live indeed; (13.) Elias,” &c. H.—When we shall witness thy return, if we prove faithful, we may expect an immortal *name*, and not otherwise. C.—He speaks in the person of those who shall live at that time. H.  
**13** *Eliseus* *.* Who received his double spirit, with his garment. 4 K. 2:15.—*Prince.* Joram. 4 K. 3:14 and 6:32.  
**14** *Overcome.* Or “escape.” Gr. Syr. He knew what Giezi and the Syrians were doing, at a distance. 4 K. 5:26 and 6:12.—*Prophesied.* Or raised the dead to life. 4 K. 13:21. C.—On his death-bed (v. 15) he also foretold the victory of Joas. Ib. 14. Vatab. &c.—The miracle wrought by his relics ( H.) shewed that he was a true prophet. W.  
**19** *Thereof.* From Gehon, a fountain on the west. 2 Par. 32:30. C.  
**20** *Lifte* *d.* Gr. “removed from Lachis, and, “&c. 4 K. 18. &c.  
**23** *He was.* Gr. “and he purified ( H. *or* redeemed, C.) them by the hand (*ministry*) of Isaias. (24.) He,” &c. H.—Prayer prevailed when troops were insufficient. 4 K. 19. W.  
**25** *Sight.* Gr. “vision.” All his predictions were verified. C.  
**26** *Life.* Fifteen years. Is. 38 and 4 K. 1:11. H.

## Chapter 49

**1** *Perfumer.* The Scripture reproaches this king alone with no fault. C.  
**3** *Directed.* Gr. “prosperous in converting the people.” 4 K. 22 and 2 Par. 24. H.—He began when he was only eight years old: but set to work more effectually ten years afterwards. The prophets complain of the disorders which prevailed before that period. C.  
**4** *Sinners.* Or “sins,” when iniquity was become fashionable. He consulted no false policy, ( H.) but boldly exerted himself in God’s service, and even invited the Israelites out of his dominions to come and celebrate the passover. 2 Par. 34:6. C.—They belonged, in effect to him, as the twelve tribes were all promised to David’s family, and the kingdom of Jeroboam was only a rebellion. C. 47:23. H.  
**5** *Sin.* The two former effaced their sins by repentance, and never tolerated idolatry, which even Josaphat and Asa did, (3 K. 22:43. &c. C.) not destroying the high places. Many others yielded not to idol worship. W.  
**6** *Despise* *d.* Gr. “they failed,” and lost the crown.  
**7** *They gave.* Achaz called in to his assistance the king of Assyria, who afterwards claimed the kingdom as tributary to him, 4 K. 18:7. 14. Gr. “He (God. C. Alex. copy has They) gave their horn,” &c. H.  
**8** *Holiness.* Jerusalem, which was styled holy, in the sicles of Simon.—*Desolate.* No one came to the festivals. Lam. 1:4.  
**9** *Renew.* To foretell the destruction and establishment of kingdoms. Jer. 1:5, 10.  
**10** *Cherubims.* Ezec. 1:4 and 8:1 and 10:1.  
**11** *Rain.* Denoting great misery. Ezec. 13:11 and 38:22. C.—*And of.* Lit. “to do good,” ( H.) or to announce the liberation of the penitent captives. Ezec. 18:21 and 23:16. &c.  
**12** *Place.* C. 45:15. The Pharisees adorned the tombs of the prophets. Matt. 23:29. Daniel is not mentioned among them, because he lived at court.  
**13** *Hand.* Most precious. Jer. 22:24. Cant. 8:6.  
**14** *Josedec* *.* He was a noble figure of Christ, and helped build the temple. Agg. i. 2. and ii. 3. Zac. 3:1 and 6:11.  
**15** *Houses.* He laboured much for the people’s welfare. 2 Esd. 5.  
**16** *Henoch.* Before the deluge. M.—He stood up for the Lord, amid the most corrupt people, and was translated. C. 44:16. He and Joseph have many advantages over the rest. C.  
**17** *Joseph.* He has not been named, but designated. C. 44 ult. C.—*Who.* Gr. the “ruler,” &c. H.  
**18** *They prophesied.* That is, by being carried out of Egypt, they verified the prophetic prediction of Joseph. Gen. l. Ch. Carriers.—This sentence is omitted in Gr. H.—See c. 48:14.—Joseph had intimated that the Israelites should leave Egypt. W.  
**19** *Men.* The former was the father of the faithful, before the deluge; the latter after. C.—*Beginning.* Gr. “in the creation” was appointed to rule. H.—He alone among men was innocent, coming from the hands of God, and he might glory that he had no other father. C.—Eve enjoyed the like privileges. H.

## Chapter 50

**1** *Simon* I. was “styled the just, on account of his piety towards God, and his good-will to his countrymen.” Jos. 12:2. Many apply what follows to him. Eus. Salien. M. &c.—But Simon II. is more probably meant, who opposed the entrance of Philopator into the sanctuary, after he had offered sacrifice for him, in the pompous manner here described. Boss. iii. Mac. C.—*Temple.* Which began to want repairs. M.—Simon II. reigned twenty years. C. Jos. 12:4. H.—The first lived in the time of Ptolemy I. of Egypt, when this book was written; and dies before it was translated, under Ptolemy III. about three hundred years before Christ. W.  
**2** *Walls.* Gr. αναλημμα, “the repairs (*or* elevated building, Mello. 2 Par. 22:5) round the temple,” including the court of the Gentiles, which had not been finished. Ezec. 40:5. It was necessary to build at the edge of the mountain, ( C.) and the wall was three hundred cubits from the bottom. This was more than double the height of the temple, as it was only one hundred and twenty cubits high. M.  
**3** *Out.* Of the reservoirs. But he repaired them. H.  
**4** *Destruction.* When it was in the most imminent danger from Philopater. 3 Mac. Bos. C.  
**5** *Enlarge.* Gr. “fortify.”—*Conservation.* Gr. “when in the midst of the people, coming out of the house of the veil. (6.) He,” &c. H.—Leaving the most holy place, he was surrounded by crowds of sacred ministers, (v. 14) or rather on the day of expiation, he came into the court of the people, to purify them. C.  
**6** *Cloud.* He was a far superior to the other priests in majestic appearance and attire, as Lucifer is to other stars, &c. v. 11. C.  
**7** *So did.* Gr. “on the temple of the Most High,” with dazzling effulgence. Jos. Bel. vi. 6.  
**11** *Forth.* Gr. adds, “fruits.”—*Reari* *ng.* Gr. “elevated to the clouds.” H.—*Robe.* Stole, or violet tunic. C.—*Power.* That is, with all his vestments, denoting his dignity and authority, ( Ch.) and extremely rich, as *virtus* often implies. C. 44:3. C.—Gr. has, “boasting.”  
**12** *Vesture.* Gr. “enclosure of holiness,” περιβολην. H.—His splendid attire of gold and jewels, cast a dazzling light all around. C.—He was pleased to offer the peace-offering for the king of Egypt, (Bossuet) to honour him, though another priest might have done it. H.  
**14** *Palm.* A forest of young ones shoots up from its roots; (Job 29:18) so the high priest shone among the other children of Aaron. C.  
**15** *King.* Gr. “Almighty” King, παντοκρατορος. H.—He presented an unblemished victim, with all due solemnity. Lev. 3:1.  
**16** *Grape.* Pouring wine upon the fire. Ex. 29:40. C.  
**17** *Prince.* Gr. “universal king.” H.—The whole sacrifice was pleasing to him.  
**18** *God.* Gr. “the Highest.” He had required these sacrifices, as memorials of his covenant, and sovereign dominion. Lev. 23:34.  
**20** *House.* Gr. Comp. and Grabe, “sound, sweet melody was made.”  
**21** *Office*, λειτουργιαν αυτου, “his service.” H.—The people prayed for king Ptolemy, to whom they were subject; though the high priest possessed almost sovereign power. The Egyptian monarch was present, ( C.) and at the end of the sacrifice expressed his resolution to go into the inmost recesses of the temple, from which the people endeavoured to dissuade him. Finding their efforts to be in vain, “they all (addressing themselves to God) said with one accord.” 3 Mac. 2. Grabe substitutes, “wherefore the high priest, Simon, kneeling down before the temple, and stretching forth his hand with solemnity, made this prayer.”  
**23** *Prayer.* Gr. “adoration, that they might receive a blessing from the Most High.” H.—*Power.* In keeping Philopator out of the temple. God granted his request, ( C. λιτανειας) “and scourged him who was so insolent and bold … throwing him like a reed, unable to move, and speechless on the pavement.” 2 Mac. 2:26. After Philopator’s guards had removed him, the high priest congratulated the people, (v. 26) expressing his abhorrence of their enemies in general, though the only mentions three neighbouring nations which had shewn a particular enmity to the Jews, when a contrary behaviour might have been expected. v. 28. H.  
**24** *Now.* A the sight of these wonders, the author exhorts the people to be grateful, and full of hope. C.  
**26** *His*, Simon’s, ( M.) or God’s *days.* When he may judge it convenient. H.  
**27** Abhorreth. Viz. with a holy indignation as enemies of God and persecutors of his people. Such were then the Edomites, who abode in Mount Seir, the Philistines, and the Samaritans, who dwelt in Sichem, and had their schismatical temple in that neighbourhood. Ch.—This was the source of continual dissensions. Joseph. xi. 8. and xii. 2. Jo. 4:20.—The Jews and Samaritans are still at variance. The former, in the days of Esdras, pronounced a curse against the latter, forbidding any of them to become converts to their religion, (Grot.) which, if true, shews a very blameable malice. See Deut. 27:4. H.—*Which*, &c. is omitted in Gr. These three nations had evinced the greatest hatred towards the Jews, and thus deserved to be accounted objects of horror, though if the author harboured any ill-will, his conduct is not praised, ( C.) but only recoreded. H.—The Samaritans consisted of Assyrians, Jews, &c. and therefore are styled no nation; and they were foolish in mixing idolatry with the true worship. W.  
**28** *Seir.* Gen. 14:6. All the Greek copies read corruptly “of Samaria.”—*Foolish.* Thus Christ said, *you adore what you know not.* Jo. 4:22. C. See 4 K. 17:29. W.  
**29** *Jesus.* He declares his name, and concludes with wishing peace to the observers of these maxims. Grotius thinks that this was inserted by the grandson, ( C.) who translated the work into Greek. H.—But there is no reason for this supposition. Solomon puts his name at the beginning and at the end of Ecclesiastes, and he frequently commends his own instructions, as this author does. C. 33:17 and 39:16 and 51:19. C.  
**31** *Steps.* He … shall have the light of life. Jo. 8:12. M.—Some Gr. copies add, “and to the pious he has given wisdom. Blessed be the Lord for ever. So be it. So be it.” H.

## Chapter 51

**1** *Sirach.* This prayer may be in imitation of the book of Wisdom. H.—Grotius assigns it to the grandson, without reason; as the author continues to speak of his travels, &c. He seems to have lived under Onias III. and under Seleucus and Antiochus Epiphanes, of Syria, to whom he was probably accused, and hence took occasion to retire into Egypt, where Ptolemy Epiphanes was king. C.—Others think ( H.) that he was accused before Ptolemy Lagus, when he took Jerusalem. M.—We know too little of his life to decide any thing. C. See c. 50:1. H.—*Saviour.* When we are not able to make a return, we must shew greater marks of gratitude, and particularly to God, for the favours which we have not deserved. W.  
**3** *By.* To accuse me. Zac. 3:1. C.  
**5** *Gates.* Gr. “many.” H.—He exaggerates the danger to which he was exposed, as he was not miraculously delivered from the flames, &c. ( C.) though this might be the case. At least he thanks God for preserving him ( H.) from the various torments which were then in use.  
**6** *In.* Gr. “from the midst of a fire which I did not enkindle,” or deserve by any crime.  
**7** *Hell.* The grave. I was preserved like Jonas. C.—*Unjust.* Gr. “the accusation was made to the king, by an unjust tongue. My soul approached unto death, and my life,” &c. H.  
**11** *World.* Shewn to Noe, Joseph, &c. C.—*Nations.* Gr. “enemies.” v. 12.  
**13** *Thou.* Gr. “I raised my supplicating voice from the earth, and I,” &c. H.  
**14** *The Father.* Grotius asserts boldly, that it should be, “my Father,” and that some Christian has changed this. But his authority may be rejected, when he brings no proof; and Bossuet has solidly refuted him. The passage clearly proves the belief of the second person, and seems to allude to Ps. 109:1. Drus. Vat. &c. C.  
**18** *When.* He now gives some account of himself, and exhorts all to seek for wisdom. H.—He was advanced in years, when he fell into the aforesaid danger, after his travels. C. 34:9. C.—Wisdom is most easily acquired, while a person is innocent. Eccle. 12. W.  
**19** *After her.* Being convinced that prayer is requisite for the preservation and improvement of such a treasure. See 3 K. 3:8. C.—*And.* Gr. “from the flower as of a ripening grape. My heart,” &c.  
**22** *Wisdom.* Gr. “instruction for myself.” H.  
**25** *Wrestled.* Against pleasure, idleness, &c. This shews how arduous a task it is to attain wisdom. C.—*Confirmed.* Greek, “in earnest.”  
**27** *Knowledge.* Gr. Alex. “time of harvest.” Grabe substitutes, “in purification,” ( H.) or the practice of virtue. Wisd. 1:4.  
**28** *Heart.* Or understanding, as the Heb. place this in the heart. 3 K. 3:9.  
**29** *Her.* I did it, with all solicitude. Cant. 5:4. Jer. 4:19. C.  
**30** *Tongue.* Eloquence, ( M.) which I will exert in praising him.  
**31** **V** **er.** **31** **.** *Gather.* Gr. “dwell in the,” &c. H.—He addresses those who are walking in the broad road.  
**33** *Silver.* Only good-will is necessary, which all may have. Is. 55:1. Rom. 10:6. Wisd. 6:13.  
**36** *Gold.* The wise man has more opportunities of enriching himself than others; but he despises unnecessary wealth. C.—We must labour for wisdom more than for riches, and we shall be rewarded hereafter. W.  
**38** *The time.* It is never too soon to be wise. *In doing good let us not fail*, (Gal. 6:9) in order to obtain that *food*, which remains for ever. Is. 6:7. *Fear God, and keep his commandments,* *for this is all man.* Eccle. 12:13. C.—This is the sum of the sapiential works, and of all the Scriptures: *To depart from evil is understanding.* Job 28:28. H.
