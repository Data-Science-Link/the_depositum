# Ezekiel Commentary

**Ezechiel,** whose name signifies the *strength of God*, was of the priestly race, and of the number of the captives that were carried away to Babylon with king Joachin. He was contemporary with Jeremias, and prophesied to the same effect in Babylon as Jeremias did in Jerusalem; and is said to have ended his days in like manner, by martyrdom. Ch.—He strove to comfort the captives, who began to repine that they had listened too readily to Jeremias, exhorting them to submit to the king of Babylon. Some think that part of his prophecies is lost, as Josephus mentions two books: but the nine last chapters, regarding the new city and temple, might form the second division. The Jews hesitated whether to allow his works to be canonical, as they seemed to differ from Moses, and from the dimensions given of Solomon’s temple. But the same God might surely suggest some improvements, and the morality of the prophet is most excellent. C.—His style may be compared to that of Homer (Grot.) and Alcæus. Many have thought that ( C.) Pythagoras was his disciple; (Eus. præp. xiii.) yet the latter seems to have lived after the prophet, who was led into captivity with Jechonias, A. 3410, and prophesied for twenty years. He dates from this period, ( C.) and from the renewal of the covenant under Josias, (C. 1:1. H.) when the captivity was first announced. W.—The Jews allowed none to read the first and the nine ( H.) last chapters, nor the beginning of Gen. nor the Cant. before they were thirty years old; and they never attempted to explain the vision nor the building of the temple, supposing it to be above the power of man. St. Jerom.

## Chapter 1

**1** *And* is either superfluous, as at the beginning of most of the sacred books, ( C.) or shews the connection of what is written with what the prophet saw or heard internally. S. Aug. in Ps. iv. S. Greg. W.—*Year:* either of the age of Ezechiel, or (as others will have it) from the solemn covenant made in the eighteenth year of Josias; (4 K. 23. Ch. W. C.) or he alludes to the era of Nabopolassur, used at Babylon, ( M.) or to the last jubilee. See Sanct. The thirtieth year, from the prediction of Holda to Josias, ( H.) concurs with the fifth of the prophet’s captivity. C. 17:12. Usher, A. 3410.—*Fourth* of the sacred year, ( C.) on Friday, 24th July, (Usher) or in Jan. S. Jer.—*Chobar*, or Aboras, which runs westward into the Euphrates, above Thapsacus. Strabo.—The captives were in those parts, though not present. C.—*Opened*, in spirit, ( H.) by faith. S. Jerom—The prophet fell prostrate. C. 2:1. H.  
**2** *Captivity.* Lit. “transmigration,” ( H.) which is more agreeable to the Heb. &c. Jechonias delivered himself up. Six years after this, Sedecias was taken. S. Jerom.  
**3** *Hand;* power, energy of the Holy Spirit. Theod.  
**4** *North*, denoting the invasion of Judea by the Chaldees. Is. 14:31. Sanct.—The Jews thought the following vision inexplicable, and deliberated about rejecting the book, when Ananias offered to answer every difficulty. They assigned him three hundred barrels of oil to light his lamp, while he performed the task. Rabbins.—This hyperbole shews their idea of its obscurity. C.—*Amber*, (*electri*) a compound of four parts of gold and one of silver, (Pliny xxxiii. 4.) more precious than either. S. Jer.—It may also mean *orichalchum*, or a mixture of gold and brass, (Bochart, anim. 2 b. vi. 16.) which was also preferred before gold alone, as it had the hardness of brass. Lucret. Serv. in xii. Æneid.  
**5** *Living creatures.* Cherubims, (as appears from Eccles. 49:10) represented to the prophet under these mysterious shapes, as supporting the throne of God, and as it were drawing his chariot. All this chapter appeared so obscure and full of mysteries to the ancient Hebrews, that, as we learn from S. Jerom, (ep. ad Paulin.) they suffered none to read it before they were thirty years old. Ch.—The pagans had many such compound figures as are here represented. Parkhurst, p. 411. H.—Sanchoniathon (ap. Eus. præp. 2.) seems to have borrowed his description from this place.—*In them.* They stood upright and had some parts of the human figure. C.—Indeed, it seems to have been predominant. H.  
**6** *Faces.* This sometimes means shapes; and Pererius supposes that the animal had the head of a man, and the breast covered with lions’ hair, the feet or round cloven hoofs of an ox, and the wings of an eagle. But it had rather four faces as well as wings, the faces of the man and lion being to the right, and the other two to the left; ( C. T.) or the eagle was behind ( H.) or above the head of the man, and the lion and ox at his right and left. Corn. a Lapide. M.  
**7** *Straight.* Heb. “a straight foot.” Prot. prefer “feet.” H.—*Of a* *calf.* Aquila reads to the same import hagol, “round,” instead of hegel, ( H.) “a calf.” Sym. has “winged feet,” like Mercury. C.—Sept. omit this, says S. Jerom, though we have his version of Sym. as if it belonged to the Sept.; and it occurs in Grabe as genuine.—*Brass.* Sept. add, “and their feathers were very light.” H.  
**8** *Wings.* Their arms were covered with feathers, and the hand appeared at the extremity; or they had four arms under the wings. C. 10:8. They all came from the shoulders, so as to correspond with the four faced animal, v. 6. C.—Others believe that each face had four wings, so that the animal would have sixteen. Maldonat.—In Is. 9:2 the cherub has six wings. The form was variable, as there was nothing in nature similar. They were perhaps designed to represent the eternity and dominion of God over the whole creation. v. 28. H.  
**9** *Another.* Two above were extended so as to support the throne, which seemed to rest on these eight wings connected together. The others were joined so as perfectly to cover what was below the breast. C.—Sept. “And the wings of those four *were* touching each other, and their faces (Calmet reads with Chal. and Heb. *wings*) turned not,” &c. H.—The wings did not imitate those of birds, going to and fro, but were constantly in the same direction; or the animals did not change their respective situations: as they had four faces, there was always one of them turned to the opposite quarters of the world. C.—They turned not about, (v. 12) but having faces on every side, were ready to go any way. W.  
**10** *Over.* This is not specified in Heb. Chal. Sept. or S. Jer. C.—“The face of an eagle for all the four.” It mist have been *above* or behind the man, as the situation of the other two faces is here determined. v. 6. H.  
**11** *Faces* *.* Sept. “wings:” and indeed it does not appear how their *faces* were *stretched upwards*, ( C.) unless they looked earnestly that way; though, out of respect, they covered their faces with two wings.  
**14** *Flashes.* Heb. Bazak. H.—Theodotion retains the original. His version seems to have been inserted in the Sept. ( C.) who omitted this verse, as seeming to contradict v. 9 and 12. S. Jer.—Yet it only signifies that the motion was quick as lightning, though they did not alter their situation with respect to each other.  
**15** *Faces.* One wheel crossed another at right angles, so that it was ready to move in any direction, (v. 17. C.) like a globe. H.  
**16** *Sea:* sky blue. Heb. “Tharsis,” which Sym. renders “the hyacinth;” a precious stone. Ex. 28:20. C.—*Midst.* The evangelists and New Testament agree perfectly with the Old. S. Greg. hom. vi. W.  
**17** *Parts. When they went, they went by their four parts.* That is, indifferently to any of their sides, either forward or backward, to the right or to the left. Ch.—Their motion was connected with the chariot. v. 20. C.  
**18** *Eyes*, like Argus, or the tail of a peacock. C.—The eye is sometimes put for a colour. Grot.  
**20** *Life.* They were moved like the rest by the whirlwind, or by living creatures. They seemed to be animated, as Homer describes Vulcan’s tripods.  
**22** *Crystal*, or sapphire. v. 26. C. 10:1. This shining sky was like the footstool of the Lord, and rested on eight wings. v. 9, 23.  
**24** *Voice.* The motion of the wings made a noise like a torrent, or thunder.—*God.* Heb. “self-sufficient,” as Sept. &c. render it, **ikanou**. C.—Prot. “like the voice of the Almighty.” H.—*Down;* or rather ceased to make such a noise. v. 25. C.  
**26** *Upon it.* This might be omitted, as the Vulg. has only *desuper, above.* H.—God was pleased to assume the shape of a man, seated on the throne.  
**27** *Amber*, or orichalcum. v. 4.  
**28** *Rainbow*, encircling the sky blue throne and the flame. Nothing could be more dazzling, nor better manifest the subjection of man. C.—The prophet saw four visions at once; the whirlwind, (v. 4) the living creatures, (v. 5) the wheels, (v. 15) and the man seated on a throne, in the sky, v. 26. To explain all these mysteries, a large commentary would scarcely suffice. W.—The tempest, cloud, and fire, shew the impending ruin of the Jews. The ministers of God are over ready to execute his orders. The wisdom of Providence is denoted by the name of the cherubim, the connection of causes by the four wheels, &c. M.—God appears in his chariot going to war. He denounces vengeance on the guilty. C. 2 and 43. See Corn. a Lapide. H.

## Chapter 2

**1** *Face*, to adore God. M.—*Son of man.* Our Saviour, out of humility, takes this title, which no other gave him; as the angel does commonly to this prophet, who was his figure: few else have received it, (Dan. 8:17) but the reason is not known. W.—God here teaches Ezechiel not to boast of the honour shewn to him, since he must always remember that he is but a feeble mortal. C.  
**2** *Spirit* of prophecy; (S. Jer. T.) or, I revived, and took courage.  
**3** *Israel.* His commission was chiefly to them. C.  
**5** *Forbear* to sin. H.—He thus insinuates free-will. S. Jer.—If they refuse to hear my *prophet*, they will at least perceive that hey are inexcusable. C.  
**6** *Scorpions.* This people is no less destructive ( H.) and hardened. Ps. 117:12.—*For* might be better rendered, “though.” C.  
**8** *Eat.* “If we do not eat the open book, we cannot teach.” S. Jer.  
**9** *Without.* This was only done when the work was long. C.—

## Chapter 3

**1** *Eat this book, and go speak to the children of Israel.* By this eating of the book, was signified the diligent attention and affection with which we are to receive and embrace the word of God; and to let it as it were, sink into our interior by devout meditation. Ch.—The revelation came from God. v. 10. W.  
**2** *Book*, in spirit; ( C.) or in reality, he chewed the volume. H.  
**3** *Mouth.* I readily accepted the commission, but soon found the difficulties to which it would expose me. v. 12. Jer. 15:16. Apoc. 10:10.  
**6** *Unknown.* Heb. “heavy.” C.—Prot. “hard.” H.—It is not above thy strength. Deut. 30:12.—*To thee.* He insinuates that the Gentiles would obey the apostles. S. Jer.—But the time was not yet come. C.—From this text and Mat. 11:21 it appears that “the same grace” is accepted by some and rejected by others, as “more grace is added to the former, which was sufficient before, and by this … is made effectual” through God’s mercy. Rom. 9. W.—Those who reject the first grace, can blame only themselves, if they receive no more. The same grace falling on a heat better prepared by God, like seed on good soil, is more fruitful.  
**7** *Hard.* Lit. “rubbed” like a stone, or brass; *attritâ* *.* H.—God’s ambassadors (Eph. 6:20. C.) must do their utmost. H.—The success must not puff them up, nor the failure too much depressed them, as all regards God, (Mat. 10:40) who will know how to make things conduce to his own glory. They must only bewail the blindness of sinners. C.—The care of them, and not the cure, will be required at their hands. v. 19. H.  
**8** *Harde* *r.* If they will not blush, thou shalt not be ashamed to lay their disorders before their eyes, though they be such as ought not to be mentioned, *as becomes saints.* H. See C. 16 and 22. C.  
**12** *Spi* *rit;* wind (Hugo) or angel, *took me* through the air; (Prado.) or, I went willingly. S. Jer.—*Commotion*, like an earthquake, (Heb. Sept.) occasioned by the motion of the chariot, or the voice of the cherubim. v. 13.  
**14** *Spirit*, resolved to rebuke ( C.) sinners. Sept. “the spirit of the Lord also lifted me … and I went aloft (*like a meteor;* μετεωρος) by the impulse of my spirit; for the hand of the Lord upon me was strong; and I went loft, to the captivity, and passed through them … conversing in the midst of them.” H.  
**15** *The heap of new corn.* It was the name of a place; in Hebrew, Telabib, ( Ch.) as the Chal. leaves it ( M.) with the three Greek interpreters. C.—Tel means “a heap,” and abib “new corn.” H.—There was no new wheat in the fourth month, but rather in May or June. C. 1:1. Ptolemy places Thelda near the Chaboras.—*Mourning;* or Prot. “astonished,” like Job’s friends, for people dead in sin. H.—Many suppose that he never spoke. Yet this is not certain, (v. 11. C.) though probable from v. 16. H.  
**17** *Watchman:* the usual title of those placed over others. C. 33:2. Is. 21:6. Let none perish through thy neglect. C.—“He (the pastor) kills the man whom he delivers up to death by silence.” S. Greg. hom. xi. 9.  
**20** *Iniquity*, for want of thy instruction; ( H.) or, if thou neglect to reclaim him, ( C.) and he perish, or owe his conversion to another, when duty requires thee to take care of him, thou shalt answer for the possible bad consequences. Thy sin is great, whatever become of him. But if he be damned, though he must blame himself chiefly, yet the blood of his soul shall cry for vengeance more than Abel’s. H.—*Before him*, taking away my grace in punishment of his revolt. W.—If thou neglect to attempt reclaiming him, thou shalt perish with him; (S. Greg.) or if he be exposed to trial, and thou abandon him, (Vat.) of if thou neglect to husband well the precious moments, when I open his eyes, and fill him with apprehensions of his dangerous state, I will require, &c. Orig. S. Jer.—*Remembered.* Ingratitude caused the fruits of virtue to decay, and former crimes to revive, in some sense. S. Tho. iii. p. q. 88. a. 1. Mat. 5:26. C.  
**21** *Warn.* It is the duty of a pastor to warn the just as well as sinners. W.—It will not suffice to do this *publicly:* sometimes we must go from *house to house*, like S. Paul, and *compel* those who are in the hedges to enter the marriage feast, by the most persuasive arguments. H.  
**25** *Bands.* It is uncertain whether by his order, or they supposed he was deranged, as our Saviour’s brethren meant to treat him. Mar. 3:21. The Chal. explains it figuratively of God’s order, attaching the prophet to his service. C.—But real chains would more forcibly shew the future captivity of Juda ( H.) which the prophet declared both by words and actions. C.  
**26** *House.* “When there is a multitude of sins, (or sinners; *peccatorum*) the offenders are unworthy of being corrected by the Lord.” S. Jer.—The prophet’s silence might suffice to admonish them. C.—He heard the Lord’s commands to C. 11:24 before he spoke to the people. M.  
**27** *Forbeareth.* Sept. “disbelieveth, let him disbelieve.” So we read, *He that is unjust,* *let him be unjust still;* (Apoc. 22:11) which denotes the most desperate condition. H.—Aquila (2 edit.) has, “he who abandons, shall be abandoned.” S. Jer.—The man who makes good use of grace shall receive more; but he who despises the offers of God, shall be justly deprived of them in his greatest need. C.

## Chapter 4

**1** *Tile*, very large. C.—Those of Italy were two feet large and one broad. Pallad.—This might be soft clay; (Grot. M.) or the siege might be marked out upon it with chalk or a sharp stile. C.  
**2** *Cast up.* The ditch would be about three feet deep, and the earth being thrown up, people might approach the town with less danger. W.—The besieged were thus also prevented from going out. 4 K. 25:1. Forts or towers were erected to overlook and clear the walls.—*Rams.* This is the first time we find them mentioned. Homer is silent about them; ( C.) and the ancient sieges lasted so long, because people had not found out the art of demolishing the walls. Diod. ii.  
**3** *Pan*, or plate, on which bread was usually baked. This was to represent the walls of the city. C.  
**4** *Sleep.* Heb. “lie down.” M.—He eat at intervals. C.—*Iniquities*, or punishments. H.  
**5** *Three*, &c. S. Jerom says some “Vulgate,” ( H.) Latin, ( C.) or rather incorrect Greek ( H.) copies read 100, others 150. See Origen, &c. C.—The Alex. copy has the former, ( H.) the Rom. edit. the latter number; and is followed by Theodoret and Maldonat. C.—But the more accurate Sept. agree with the Heb. &c. The captivity of Israel must be dated from Phacee, (4 K. 15:29) to the end of the reign of Darius Memnon, who espoused Esther, and granted liberty “to all the Jews;” or rather from Manathem, (4 K. 15:19) to the 28th of the same king Assuerus. Thus God’s “grace, we think, and we may so speak without arrogance, has enabled us to explain this difficulty, which no other has done.” S. Jer.—Many confound the duration of the iniquity of Israel with that of Juda, forming 430 years; and they explain it of the time during which the nation had prevaricated. But this seems unnatural. We may rather conclude, that the prophet speaks of a separate judgment, and dates from the destruction of Samaria and of Jerusalem. The former city was taken A. 3283. If we add 390 years, we shall find the year 3673 the very year when Alexander overcame Darius, and soon after granted the Jews full liberty to return, or live according to their own laws. This he granted to those *in Babylon*, and to the Israelites ( C.) *in Media.* Jos. Ant. xi. ult. & c. Ap. i.—Philadelphus afterwards liberated many in Egypt, (Jos. Ant. xii. 2.) as Osee (11:11) had foretold. The chastisement of Juda must be dated from the destruction of Jerusalem under Sedecias, till Darius, the Mede, favoured the Jews about forty years afterwards. C.—S. Jerom only allows forty years to have elapsed from the first of Jechonias till the first of Cyrus. The want of an exact chronology gives rise to many such difficulties. H.—It is very hard to explain how the ten tribes were 390 and the two tribes 40 years in captivity, as it is certain that the latter were seventy year banished from their own country. W.—Perhaps during the last thirty their condition was greatly ameliorated, after the decree of Cyrus, though the liberation was only perfect under Hystaspes and Esther. H.—The *iniquity* of Israel, from Solomon to Salmanasar, lasted 390 years; and that of Juda, under the reign of Manasses, was most abominable for the space of forty years; (Tournemine) or it continued so long from the 18th of Josias till the 4th, after the city was destroyed, and the land became a desert. Usher, A. 3380 to 3420.—But how shall the reign of the virtuous Josias be included in this period? H.—The action of the prophet lying 430 days, denoted the length of the siege of Jerusalem, during which extreme scarcity should be felt, and also the captivity of the people. Some have thought that he could not remain 390 days on one side, and that all passed in spirit. But what impression would that make upon the people? He was chained down, ( C.) to represent their miserable condition. H.—Prædo saw a fool who lay tied in one posture for above fifteen years. C.—The remaining so long in one posture must have been painful to the prophet. T.  
**7** *Siege*, which shall be most terrible; ( H.) 390 days: the pillage shall last other forty. T.—So many years have the people transgressed.—*Out.* Heb. “naked.” Thus various barbarians fight.—*Prophesy*, not by words, (C. 8:16) but by actions. M.  
**10** *Staters*, sicles, each being equal to 9 dwt. 2.57 gr. Eng. The hin contained 1 gal. 2 pints. Arbuthnot. H.—He had an allowance of ten ounces a-day. C. T.  
**12** *Barley*, the worst or usual food of the poor. H.—*Ashes*, to denote hurry. C.—*Cover* with hot ashes, ( H.) formed of dry excrements. C.—That of oxen is still used in Egypt, (Val. ep. xi.) and in some parts of England, by the poor people. Hooke.—This was more tolerable, ( C.) and God agrees to substitute it. v. 15. Heb. “Thou shalt eat it *as* barley cakes, and shalt bake,” (Prot.) or “hide it,” &c. Sept. H.—“The law itself, which the Jews read and do not understand, is this ember cake covered with human dung.” Phil. 3:8.—“They adore not idols, but do all for the belly and for earthly goods.” S. Jer.  
**13** *Filthy.* Israel was less careful to avoid uncleannesses than Juda. Hence the prophet eats only during 390 days. Osee 9:3. C.—While the city was pillage for *forty days*, the prisoners would procure better food. v. 7. H.  
**14** *Ah.* He makes the same exclamation as Jeremias. 1:6. Heb. aha*.* Theodot. “Oh!” Sept. and Sym. “by no means.” H.—God forbid. Excrements make a person legally unclean. Deut. 23:12. C.  
**15** *Neats*, or “oxen;” *boum* *.* Prot. “cow’s dung.” H.—God allows him to bake his bread under such ashes. C.—So great is his condescension towards his friends! T.  
**16** *Staff.* As this supports the weak, so bread nourishes all men, ( W.) particularly *the bread of life.* S. Jer.—Very little food, ( C.) and that of a nauseous kind, ( H.) would be found during the siege. C.  
**17** *When.* Prot. “they may want bread and water, and be astonished one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.” H.

## Chapter 5

**1** *That.* Heb. “the scissors of clippers.” The same term is used for clipping sheep as for cutting hair. Shaving was not probably then in use.—*Beard*, as in mourning or for ignominy. 2 K. 10:4. Jer. 47:5.—*Balance*, to shew that God does nothing unjustly. C.—*The* hair. Lit. “them.” H.—This was to be done before he lay down. Hew was to burn, cut, and divide the hair as the siege represented on the tile advanced, to denote that some should perish in the city by famine, others by the sword, while a few should be scattered among the nations: yet of these a *small number* should be gathered round Godolias, and perish with him, or in Egypt, &c. and the rest be thence led captive to Babylon.  
**2** *Third.* Sept. and Theod. read “a fourth,” as also v. 12. ( C.) thus assigning half to be burnt by *death* (pestilence) *and famine.* The other half of the people falls a prey to the *sword* and to *captivity.* The pestilence, famine, and the sword, were the three usual scourges left to David’s choice, (2 K. 24) which here destroy each a fourth part, while the rest become captives. Yet even of this third or fourth part, many engage in civil broils, and perish. S. Jerom hints that the Sept. is interpolated from Theodotion, v. 12, and that their version only comprised the pentateuch. But the other books went at least under the same title; and there must be some mistake in the words asterisked, since they occur in the Heb. Vulg. &c. *third* being only substituted for *fourth:* “And a fourth part of thee shall fall by the sword.” The Heb. is rather less degrading to the Jews, as there would be thus at most one-third preserved, instead of a part only of one-fourth. See Deut. 27:4. Jer. 52:28.—*Take.* Sept. add here, “a fourth part; and shalt burn it in the midst of it; and a fourth thou shalt cut,” &c. H.—He was thus to deal with a part of the hair during 390 days, ( M.) or at the end of them. R. Salom.—*Round*, in the cities near Jerusalem, ( W.) or round the picture of it. C. 4:1.  
**4** *Out* *of it.* Some rose up against Godolias. Jer. 40. &c. C.—The divisions of the Jews brought on the persecution of Epiphanes, (Sanct.) and introduced Pompey. S. Jer. H.  
**5** *Midst*, distinguished above the rest. Many have supposed that the city was in the exact middle of Palestine, or of the world. Ps. 73:12. C.  
**7** *Surpassed.* in numbers, (Sym.) or rather in wickedness. Chal. C.—Sept. “because you have been incited by the,” &c. H.—*Judgments.* You have been less attached to my service than the Gentiles have been to their idols. Some think that *not* is here superfluous, as it is omitted C. 11:12. But it is wrong to imitate the Gentiles, and worse to surpass them in crimes.  
**9** *Like.* The ruin of Jerusalem by the Chaldees was terrible, ( C.) but that by the Romans was more so. S. Jer.—The reasons were different.  
**10** *Fathers.* This is not specified in history. *Famine prevailed*, 4 K. 25:3.; and we find something similar, Lam. 4:10. C. Bar. 2. W.—It is probable, therefore, that these threats were realized. Theod. Deut. 28:53.—*Scatter.* Lit. “winnow.” H.—The Jewish nation was never again all together in the promised land.  
**12** *Pestilence.* Sept. “death;” so they usually denote pestilence. They add, “and a fourth part of thee shall be,” &c. v. 2. H.  
**13** *Comforted*, or revenged. C. 24:14. Is. 1:24.  
**14** *And a.* Sept. “and thy daughters (dependances. C.) round,” &c. H.  
**15** **Ver** **.** **15** **.** *Scoff.* Lit. “blasphemy;” which is here used improperly, to denote derision. W.  
**16** *Arrows;* inclemency of the seasons, &c. which bring on famine. M.  
**17** *Beasts.* They usually take possession of abandoned countries. S. Jer.—The Chaldees may also be meant. C. 17:3.

## Chapter 6

**2** *Mountains*, where idols were chiefly adored. Here their votaries find death. W.—*Israel*, including all God’s people, as the sacred writers make no distinction ( C.) after the destruction of Samaria.  
**4** *Idols.* Protestant marginal note, “sun-images,” as v. 6. The sun was much worshipped. C. 8:16. H.  
**5** *Bones.* The Chaldees violated the tombs. Bar. 2:24. Jer. 8:1. C.  
**8** *Some.* Providence still preserves some faithful or penitent souls. W.  
**9** *Broken.* Adversity has made them repent.  
**11** *Foot*, through indignation or pity. C.  
**14** *From*, or, “more than,” ( H.) as Heb. may signify. Deblatha was in the land of Moab. Num. 33:46. C.

## Chapter 7

**2** *Israel*, or Judea, in all its parts. W.—In five or six years’ time all shall be destroyed.  
**3** *Set*, as accusers, to increase thy confusion.  
**5** *One.* A second shall not be necessary. Nah. 1:9. C.  
**6** *Awaked.* Justice seems to have slept. H. See v. 10. Jer. 1:12.  
**7** *Destruction*, (*contritio* *.*) S. Jerom reads “contraction,” as also v. 10. Prot. “the morning.” H.—Chal. “the reign.” C.—Heb. tsephira, is variously rendered. H.—*Joy.* Heb. “echo or cry” of people in the vintage.  
**10** *Budded;* figurative expressions, denoting a speedy vengeance. C.—Chal. “the reign is open, the ruler has flourished, the wicked hath appeared.” In this reign of Nabuchodonosor ye shall be chastised. H.—Sept. or rather Theodotion, from whom many things have bee supplied according to S. Jerom, ( C.) have, “The deceit (*or* thick foliage; πλοκη) has gone forth, the rod,” &c. H.  
**11** *Iniquity.* What other fruit could be expected from wickedness? It draws on chastisement.—*Noise*, or grandees. None will repent, and therefore none shall escape, from the highest to the lowest.  
**13** *Sold*, as in the year of jubilee. Lev. 25:25. C.—Now there shall be no recovery. W.—They shall be driven from the land.—*Although.* By supplying the former negation, ( C.) we may render “Nor,” &c. ( H.) which seems better. C.—It may also mean, “those who are now alive” shall witness these things. H. *Back.* It is not a mere threat.  
**14** *Ready.* He describes the vain attempts of the Jews to make resistance.  
**16** *Doves*, not daring to vent their complaints. C.  
**17** *Water;* urine, (S. Jer.) sweat, &c. the usual effects of fear.  
**18** *Heads.* They cut their hair in times of penance and of mourning.  
**19** *Iniquity.* Riches have fostered their passions: they will not now procure food or liberty. Soph. 1:18. C.—The riches of the idols invited the enemy to plunder. W.  
**20** *And.* Prot. “As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the,” &c. The sacred ornaments of the temple, appointed by God, ( H.) have been converted into idols, and shall be carried to Babylon. v. 21. C.  
**22** *Secret:* the inward sanctuary, the holy of holies. Ch.—God would guard it no longer. C.  
**23** *Shutting up.* Heb. “chain,” for imprisonment and captivity. Ch.—Pronounce sentence upon all.  
**24** *Sanctuary;* the temple of God, or of idols. C. 6:3.  
**25** *Distress.* When the enemy is before the city, they will see their error; but it will be too late. They shall not obtain peace. Jer. 38:1.  
**26** *Ancients.* Priests shall afford no consolation, nor counsellors any advice. They shall be all confounded. C.—During the captivity a few only were found to give instruction. Mal. 2. W.

## Chapter 8

**1** *Sixth* of the prophet’s captivity, ( C.) in August, A. 3411. Usher—He had rested on his *left* or *right side*, whenever he slept during 430 days, and on the following had this vision. W.—He was stationed in spirit at the northern gate leading to the court of the priests, and beheld the glory of God and *the idol of jealousy.* He saw the people, men and women, adoring idols, and priests worshipping the sun. C. 9. God rests on the gate of the temple, and orders a man to sign those who were to live, and six others to destroy the rest. The prophet prays. C. 10. God orders the man clothed in linen to take coals from the cherubim, and sprinkle them through the city. The throne goes to receive the Lord. C. 11. Ezechiel prophesies against many, at the eastern gate; and God informs him that the former captives shall return, but that the wicked at Jerusalem shall perish. His chariot then rests on the mountain to the east of the city. Thus his reasons for punishing the people become evident.  
**2** *Likeness.* Sept. add, “of a man,” as it had appeared C. 1:27.  
**3** *Lock*, like Habacuc; (Dan. 14:35) or by a bandage, on which parts of the law were written. Heb. C.—*Of jealousy;* Baal, (S. Jer.) or any other idol, ( H.) particularly Adonis. v. 14. He fell a victim to the jealousy of Mars.  
**10** *About.* This was the council chamber. Jer. 26:10. They durst not publicly adore the Egyptian, &c. idols. C.—They denied Providence. v. 12. H.—The wicked do not regard it, and hence fall into idolatry. W.  
**11** *Jezonias* *.* He probably was over the temple, as his father had been. 4 K. 22:3. C.  
**14** *Adonis*, the favourite of Venus, slain by a wild boar, as feigned by the heathen poets, and which being here represented by an idol, is lamented by the female worshippers of that goddess. In Heb. the name is *Tammuz*, ( Ch.) which means “concealed,” as Adonis signifies “my lord.” This idol, which the Egyptians called Osiris, was placed in a coffin, and bewailed till it was pretended he was come to life, when rejoicings took place. Obscene pictures were carried about; and the more honest pagans were ashamed of these practices, which began in Egypt, and became almost general. Moses alludes to them, Lev. 19:27. Deut. 14:1. C.—David and Solomon say that the image was made of brass, with eyes of lead, which seemed to weep, melting when it was hot. W.—But this is destitute of proof.  
**16** *Men.* Twelve priests and as many Levites officiated daily. The high priest made the twenty fifth. 1 Par. 24.—*Sun.* They prayed to God, turning their faces to the west: but here they despised him, and adored the sun. Job 31:26. C.—This posture was common. *Illi ad surgentem conversi lumina solum* *.* Æn. xii. Serv.—Christians did the like, though the reason is not ascertained. C.—It might be because Christ is the *orient*, and not to resemble the Jews. There was no danger of their being taken for idolaters. H.  
**17** *Nose*, to hide their faces respectfully, ( C.) when they look at the sun rising. H.—A *thyrsus* was used in honour of Bacchus, who is often confounded with the sun. Various improbable versions of this text are given. It may signify Heb. “they threw their instruments down before their faces,” like the twenty-four elders. Apoc. 5:8. C.

## Chapter 9

**2** *Upper*, leading to the court of the priests. These were six angels, representing the army coming from Babylon. The seventh was an angel of peace. C.—God never abandoned his whole Church. W.  
**3** *House;* to the holy place, shewing that he abondoned those in the temple. C.  
**4** *Mark Thau.* Thau, or Tau, is the last letter in the Hebrew alphabet, and signifies *a sign* or *a mark:* which is the reason why some translators render this place *set a mark*, or *mark a mark*, without specifying what this mark was. But S. Jerom, and other interpreters, conclude it was the form of the letter *thau*, which, in the ancient Hebrew character, was the form of a cross. Ch.—Of this many inscriptions still extant bear witness. Montfaucon.—Some Rabbins allow that the last letter was used but in honour of “the law,” *Thorah* *.* The cross is supposed to be the hieroglyphic of a future life, (Hist. Rufini. ii. 29.) and found frequently in the pictures or ( H.) in the tables of Isis. But it rather represents a key. Soldiers who were acquitted received the letter T, and those who were sentenced to die had Θ, ( C.) alluding to Θανατος, “death.” H.—We may, however, suppose that if God designated any letter, it would be some letter of the Heb. alphabet, and accordingly the last had formerly the figure of †. *x.* though this text may signify “a sign” in general. The virtuous would be discriminated from the guilty, as if they were marked. C.—The door-posts of the Hebrews were stained with blood, in Egypt, to shew that all should be redeemed by that of Christ; and here those who shall be saved, received the mark of his cross. This sign has always been held in veneration among Christians, ( W.) and used in conferring baptism, consecrating the blessed Eucharist, &c. S. Chrys. hom. lv. in Mat. and lxxxiv. in Jo. S. Aug. tr. cxviii. in Jo. Ser. ci. de temp. &c.—It appeared to Constantine with this inscription, “In this conquer;” (Eus. vit. i. 22.) and again over Jerusalem; (S. Cyr. ep. ad Constantium.) and will be borne before Christ, at his last coming, (Mat. 24) to the joy of those who have performed their baptismal promises, and to the confusion ( W.) of the *enemies of the cross of Christ.* H.  
**6** *Sanctuary.* Aquila, “temple,” or people ( C.) consecrated to my service, (Sept. T.) particularly ( C.) the twenty-five idolaters, the ancients and women. C. C. 8:16.—*Judgment beginneth at the* *house of God*, (1 Pet. 4:17) and those ( H.) who abuse holy things are justly cut off. W.  
**7** *Defile.* Sept. “you have defiled.” I regard the place no longer. C.  
**9** *Perverseness*, in “wresting of judgment.” Prot. marg. What else can be expected, when the judges deny Providence? H.  

---

## Chapter 10

**1** *Throne.* It was a sky blue crystal or sapphire colour, (C. 1:22, 26) and was now empty. C. 1. The Lord spoke from the temple door. v. 4. H.  
**2** *Out*, to purify (S. Jer.) or punish the city, (Theod.) which would shortly be reduced to ashes. Vat. M.  
**3** *Right*, south of the priests’ court.  
**4** *Lifted up*, before C. 9:3. C.—A man seemed to be on the throne, ( W.) or rather over the door of the holy place.  
**5** *Court* of the people.—*Speaking* in thunder.  
**8** *Wings.* They would seem to be distinct, or ( C.) fingers appeared at the end of the wings. Grot.  
**9** *Stone.* Heb. Tharsis*.* Sym. “Hyacinth.” C. 1:16. C.  
**11** *By four ways.* That is, by any of the four ways, forward, backward, to the right, or to the left. Ch. W.  
**12** *Wheels.* These, as well as ( H.) the cherubim, (Theod.) were full of eyes. C.  
**13** *Voluble.* That is, *rolling wheels:* galgal, ( Ch.) which means “rolling:” ( H.) or “he said to the wheels, Turn around about.” Theodoret.—This is the real import of Heb. C.—Prot. have, “O wheel.” H.  
**14** *Cherub*, or “ox.” All four seem to have had the resemblance of a man, but one more than the rest, which had respectively the appearance rather of an ox, a lion, or an eagle: ( W.) or *the* ox was predominant in all, as both the head and feet were of it; ( C.) which, however, does not constitute the greatest part. C. 1:5. H.  
**15** *Creature.* What I saw, was properly called cherubim. *Charab*, in Syr. means “to labour;” (Spencer) or cherubim may imply any composed and unusual figure, or “mixture.” Ex. 25:18. C.—Ezechiel being a priest, saw that the creatures resembled the cherubim of the temple. T.  
**17** *Life.* They were not mere machines; ( H.) or they were pushed forward by an impetuous wind.  
**19** *East gate*, leading from the city to the court of the people. C.—How unwilling is this good father to leave his house! T.  
**20** *Creature.* The cherubim and all the throne seemed alive. H.  
**22** *Forward*, thus shewing God’s decree to abandon the synagogue. T.

## Chapter 11

**1** *Me.* The prophet in Chaldea, saw in spirit what was doing at Jerusalem. W.—*Men.* Magistrates. Prado. T. M.—*Jezonias*, perhaps mentioned C. 8:11. C.  
**3** *Built*, &c. These men despised the predictions and threats of the prophets; who declared them to be from God, that the city should be destroyed and the inhabitants carried into captivity: and they made use of this kind of argument against the prophets, that the city so far from being like to be destroyed, had lately be augmented by the building of new houses; from whence they further inferred, by way of a proverb, using the similitude of a cauldron, out of which the flesh is not taken till it is thoroughly boiled and fit to be eaten, that they should not be carried away out of thier city, but there end their days in peace. Ch.—They thought themselves secure, ( W.) and laughed at the menaces of Jeremias, 1:15. C.—Heb. “The destruction is not soon coming. Let us build;” (Pagn. M.) or, “It is not time to build.” C.  
**6** *Slain*, under Manasses, &c. T.  
**7** *Cauldron.* I will explain the prediction, which you turn to ridicule. Those whom you have slain, are like the flesh ( C.) boiled. H.—But you shall be treated still worse, being led captives and slain. C.—They feared wars, but had no dread of captivity. W.  
**10** *Israel.* They pretended that they should die in peace in Jerusalem: God tells them it should not be so, but that they should be judged and condemned, and fall by the sword in the borders of Israel; viz. in Reblatha, in the land of Emath, where all their chief men were put to death by order of Nabuchodonosor. 4 K. 25 and Jer. 52:10. 27. Ch.  
**12** *But you.* Some copies of Sept. have, “neither have you done.” C. 5:7.  
**13** *Pheltias*, the prince, (v. 1. H.) or false prophet, whose death Ezechiel does not bewail, but fears the great destruction of the people; ( W. M.) though, if Pheltias died impenitent, his death might justly call for tears. H.—This happened in a vision. Yet ( C.) he probably died suddenly about his time. Lyran.  
**15** *Thy brethren*, &c. He speaks of them that had been carried away captives before, who were despised by them that remained in Jerusalem; but, as the prophet here declares to them from God, should be in a more happy condition than they, and after some time return from their captivity. Ch.—David had been insulted in like manner. 1 K. 26:19. C.  
**16** *A* *little.* Heb. “for a short time, a sanctuary,” or temple. They shall find all things in me. The Christian Church was never more pure than during the first persecutions, when her children could not assemble freely, or build temples. C.—God will never totally abandon her. Jer. 4:27. &c. W.  
**18** *Scandals:* idols. They relapsed no more into idolatry, ( C.) as a nation, though some fell in the persecution of Epiphanes. H.  
**19** *One.* Sept. “another.” They have read ( C.) *acher* for echad, “one.” H.  
**21** *Head.* I will punish them as their crimes deserve. C.  
**23** *Mount* Olivet, whence he might behold the conflagration of the city, before his ascent into heaven. M.—He leaves his habitation by degrees, to shew how Jerusalem would be treated, and the Jews suffer after the ascension of our Saviour. Theodoret well observes, that the person on the throne represented Him, the upper part of the body being different from the lower, (C. 1:26) to denote the two natures. C.

## Chapter 12

**3** *Removing.* Lit. “vessels of transmigration,” ( H.) or bundles, ( C.) and what was requisite for travelling, ( W.) or in exile. H.—All this, to C. 20 happened five years before the fall of Jerusalem. C.—See C. 8:1. H.  
**6** *Be carried.* Sept. S. Jerom reads, “thou shalt carry *thy bundles* on the shoulder,” as many explain the Heb. ( C.) and also v. 7. “I bear *it* upon *my* shoulder.” v. 12. Prot. H.—*Cover*, to denote the blindness of Sedecias, ( C.) or his attempt to disguise himself. H.—The faces of criminals were covered. Est. 7. The king and nobles escaped through a breach. Jer. 39:4. C.—*Sign.* Lit. “a prodigy to,” &c. H.—The actions as well as the words of the prophet indicated what would happen. S. Jer. v. xi.  
**10** *Jerusalem.* The people regarded not Jeremias. This prediction would be sent to them to confirm what he said, while it would tend to keep up the spirits of those who were in captivity. Theod. C.—*Israel.* The people, or those of the ten tribes who had retired thither. M.  
**13** *Net*, as was done in war, and to catch wild beasts. Jer. 16:16. C.—*Not see it*, because his eyes shall be put out by Nabuchodonosor. Ch.—The false prophets thought they perceived a contradiction here; ( W.) and Sedecias, confronting it with Jerem. 38:18 disregarded both. Jos. Ant. x. 10.—This was more pardonable than for Paine to object this as an inconsistency, after the event has so clearly verified the predictions of both, and shewed their consent. H.—The unhappy prince saw too late the true meaning. C.—He was put in a cage, like a wild beast, and conveyed blind to Babylon. S. Jer.  
**14** *Them.* Many joined Godolias. C. 5:2. H.  
**18** *Sorrow.* Act like one under great anxiety and distress. C.  
**22** *Proverb*, or common saying. W.—*Prolonged.* They took occasion from God’s long suffering to become more wicked, ( C.) and even asserted that the prophets told nothing but lies, (Theod.) and spoke of events at a great distance, that they might not be detected. If what they announced came to pass, they attributed it to chance; ( C.) if it did not, being only *conditional*, they ridiculed this idea as a mere subterfuge. H.—As the prophets had long before foretold the captivity, and it had not yet taken place, ( W.) in general, though many were already in exile, ( H.) they concluded that it would never be realized. Thus heretics deny the general judgment. 1 Pet. 3. W.—*Ever* *y vision*, on this head. v. 28. Many events were revealed that regarded the times of Christ. Dan. 9. &c. H.  

---

## Chapter 13

**2** *Heart;* what pleases them, ( H.) without being inspired. There were always such impostors. These deluded the people at Jerusalem, ( C.) or at Babylon. v. 9. Sanct.—They might be distinguished by the sincere: yet caused irreparable injury to the ignorant people. H.  
**3** *Nothing.* Yet would lead the blind, though they are not directed by God.  
**4** *Deserts*, or ruins. They sought only to gratify themselves.  
**5** *Enemy.* You do not admonish sinners of their evil ways, nor strive to avert God’s indignation, in imitation of true prophets, (Ex. 32:10) but rather undermine the wall like foxes.  
**9** *Upon*, to punish.—*Counsel.* They shall not be consulted, or have any credit.—*Writing.* They shall perish in the city, or in banishment. C.—Their works shall not be accounted canonical. Sixt. Bib. ii. 2.  
**10** *Straw.* Iniquity ruins my people, ( C.) and these do not endeavour to reform their manners. H.—They ought to demolish such a work, and not dab it over. Theod.—One false prophet builds, and another strives to support his authority; (Jun.) or God has given the people his law, but these people corrupt it. S. Jer.—A wall built without proper mortar, will easily be washed down: so vain hopes of security, without amendment, deceive the people. W.  
**11** *Hailstones.* Lit. “stones,” like those which fell on the enemies of Josue, (10:11. H.) or thunderbolts. Grot. C.—Such will be the fate of all the buildings of the wicked. Mat. 7:27. H.—None can resist the judgments of God, who will employ the Chaldeans. M.  
**14** *You.* Lit. “it.” But Heb. and Sept. have, “ye.” H.—The wall and the inhabitants shall perish. C.  
**17** *Daughters:* so false prophets are styled in scorn, (Vat.) or witches; (Rabbins) though it seems rather that there were false prophetesses as well as true ones. Such were Prisca and Maximilla among the Montanists. Women have commonly fostered heresies. C.—These pretended to be illuminated, like Debora and Holda; but flattered the people in their sins, instead of reclaiming them. W.  
**18** *Cushions*, by making people easy in their sins, and promising them impunity, ( Ch.) by disguising the truth, or not admonishing people of their danger. C. 3:17. He alludes to the cushions used on sofas.—*Pillows.* Sym. “veils;” (Sept. and Kimchi) or “nets” designed “to take” the unwary; as mispachot maybe properly rendered. v. 20, 21. Is. 5:7. C.—*Souls.* That is, they flattered them with promises of life, peace, and security. Ch. W.—People are often said to do what they only announce. Lev. 13:11. These impostors pretended to save, while they really destroyed. They shewed a cruel mercy, detaining the people in captivity, or rather Heb. “shall you catch?” &c. Do you expect to pass unpunished? C.—We might read the Vulg. “Did they give?” &c. Prot. “Will ye save the souls alive *that come* unto you?” H.  
**19** *Violated me.* That is, dishonoured and discredited me. Ch.—Prot. “and will ye pollute?” &c. H.—They employed the name of God to give credit to their lies, for the smallest advantage.—*Souls*, &c. That is, to sentence souls to death, which are not to die: and to promise life to them who are not to live. Ch.—They contradicted Jeremias, who exhorted the people to surrender. C.  
**20** *Catch.* Hebrew also, “hunt the souls to make them into gardens, ( H.) or flourishing.” Sept. “you gather souls there.” The original seems to be incorrect. v. 18.  
**22** *Just.* Jeremias, or any other, particularly the more simple, who were easily seduced and filled with apprehensions. You shall therefore die, (v. 23) and your imposture shall be made known. C.  

---

## Chapter 14

**3** *Uncleanness.* That is, their filthy idols, upon which they have set their hearts: and which are a stumbling-block to their souls. Ch.—They came, it seems, to tempt the prophet, ( C.) as God shewed him. Thus worldlings consult Catholic priests; yet are resolved to join with heretics. W.  
**4** *According.* Heb. “in ( C.) the multitude of his idols.” H.—I will still disclose the truth; (Chal.) or a false prophet is here spoken of, whom God will suffer to deceive those who wish to be deluded. He will not have his own prophets speak an untruth. See 3 K. 22:10. Christ evaded the insidious questions of his enemies. Mat. 21:23. C.  
**5** *The.* Sept. “he may ensnare the house,” ( H.) or “to bring” unto repentance. Chal. C.  
**6** *Turn.* Such people must first be admonished to relinquish idols, heresy, &c. that they may come to God. W.  
**7** *By myself*, or on my own account. God does not encourage falsehood. C.  
**9** *Err.* He speaks of false prophets, answering out of their own heads, and according to their own corrupt inclinations.—*Deceived*, &c. God Almighty *deceives* false prophets, partly by withdrawing his light from them; and abandoning them to their own corrupt inclinations, which push them on to prophesy such things as are agreeable to those that consult them: and partly by disappointing them, and causing all things to happen contrary to what they have said. Ch.—God permits the deception, to punish both the impostor and his hearers. W.—Thus was Balaam treated. C. Num. 22. H.—He could do nothing of himself. S. Jer. 2 K. xxii. 22. C.—Here also an interrogation might be used ( H.) in Heb. “have I?” &c. Feiffer dub. cent. 4. b. lviii.—I have manifested the deceit. C. 13:18.  
**10** *Be.* They shall be punished alike. C.  
**14** *Job.* He and Noe were dead, yet undoubtedly interceded for the people, or their names would not here be mentioned. Jer. 15:1. W.—When God is resolved to treat all with rigour, he will save only the just. They shall not be able to protect even their children. But Jerusalem shall not experience such severity. v. 21. C.—Noe could not avert the deluge, nor Job the death of his children, neither could Daniel rescue his people from captivity. S. Jer.—The first denotes pastors, the second fathers of families, and Daniel such as live continent. S. Aug.—All three had been very merciful. S. Chrys. hom. xliii. 1. in Gen.—Job is placed for holy laymen, and Daniel for people of religious orders. S. Greg. Mor. i. 13. W.—Hence perhaps Job is placed last, though cotemporary with Moses, as most people suppose. He is not therefore a fabulous personage. H.  
**19** *Pestilence.* Sept. “death,” as v. 12. ( C.) denoting the plague. C. 5:2. H.  
**22** *Left.* Pastors will always remain to instruct God’s children. W.—*Doings.* Their words ( C.) and conduct even in captivity, will evince that they have not been punished unjustly. S. Jer.—From them you may judge what sort of men their fathers were; or, as they have been spared for their virtue, you may conclude that the rest would not have perished, if they had been innocent. H.

## Chapter 15

**2** *Wood.* Small branches or tendrils. The vines of that country were probably small. C.—The wild vine (Sanct.) grows very large, and the wood is durable, so that statues, pillars, and ladders were formed of it. Pliny xiv. 1.—Strabo (ii. and xi.) mentions the trunk of a vine which two men could hardly clasp, and the bunch of grapes was two cubits high. But the prophet speaks of the small branches, which are fit only for the fire. C.—God’s Church is often compared to a vine on account of its fruit, and the branches separated from her resemble the useless cuttings. S. Aug. tr. lxxxi. in Jo. W.—See Ward’s *Tree of Life*, where this is set in a very striking light. In every age the Church makes fresh conquests, while heretics leave and persecute her. H.  
**3** *Thereon.* Is. 22:23. C.—The Turkish lords have no furniture in their rooms, but hang their arms, saddles, &c. upon such pins, or on strings. Roger. ii.  
**4** *Ashes.* It is not even solid enough for fuel. C.—When a faggot is consumed in the middle, the ends are also put into the fire; so not one shall escape who dies out of the Church. W.—The wicked Jews shall surely suffer. v. 6. H.  
**7** *From fire.* If they escape one misery they shall fall into another, as the event shewed. C.—They shall be thrown back into the *fire.* M.

## Chapter 16

**3** *Cethite*, or “Hethite.” These two were probably the most abandoned of Chanaan. Daniel (13:56) give the infamous judges the like appellation; and Isaias (1:10) calls the Jews princes of Sodom. C.—So Dido says to Eneas:  
**4** *Cut.* By this the infant received nourishment in the womb. Now it seems to be exposed by its parents. C.—The Jews in Egypt were abandoned to idolatry and distress. Theod. in Cant.—*Health.* Many plunged the infant in cold water to brace its nerves, ( C.) or to wash it. Salt was also used to dry up the humidity and stop the pores, (S. Jer.) or it was mixed with water to harden the skin and navel. Avicen. Gall. San. i. 7.—*Clouts*, to keep the body straight. The negroes who neglect this are stronger and better proportioned, ( C.) and too much restraint is known to be detrimental to the tender limbs. H.  
**5** *Born*, as it were in Egypt. He represents the Jews as a female from her infancy, till she be advanced in years.  
**6** *Thy blood*, unwashed after being born. v. 4. C.—The Jews were solicitous to increase their numbers, and exposed none. Tacit. Hist. v.—But other nations did, if they thought the child would be troublesome, or a disgrace. C.—The prophet sends this admonition from Chaldea, and shews how God had selected his people from among the barbarous nations, and decorated them with many privileges of the law, sacrifices, &c. W.  
**7** *Woman’s.* Heb. “the ornament of ornaments;” hadaiim instead of harim in Sept. “the city of cities,” ( C.) or the highest glory, being arrived at that age when decorations are most sought after.—*Fashioned.* Lit. “swelling.” Sept. “erect.” H.—*Hair*, (*pilus* *.*) Women are allowed by canon law to marry at twelve. C.  
**8** *Lo* *vers.* Heb. dodim, “breasts, ( H.) *or* espousals;” (Aq.) “loving.” Sym.—*Garment*, as a husband. Ruth 3:9. Jer. 2:2.  
**9** *Oil*, used after bathing, or with perfume. C.  
**10** *Embroidery.* Lit. “various colours.” H.—But this is the import. Ps. 44:10.—*Violet*, or dark blue, appropriated to princes.—*Linen*, or cotton. Ex. 25. Prov. 31:24. C.—*Fine.* Lit. “thin.” Heb. Mesi, ( H.) “silken.” Jarchi. Pagn. &c. Silk was used much later at Rome, ( C.) and was reprobated as not covering the body sufficiently.  
**12** *Forehead.* Lit. “mouth.” Heb. “nose.” H.—Women wore rings where spectacles are placed, and had others hung at their noses, so as to touch the mouth. People who are not acquainted with this odd custom, which is still prevalent in Africa and Asia, suppose that the ornament hung upon the forehead, as S. Jerom does. See Gen. 24:22. C.  
**13** *Linen.* Heb. mossi*.* v. 11. H.—Chal. understands these ornaments to pertain to the tabernacle, which was set up in the wilderness.—*Oil*, enjoying a most fertile country, ( C.) and the noblest sacrifices. H.—*And wast*, &c. The kingdom had subsisted 1500 years. C.—Sept. omit this, for fear of giving umbrage to the Egyptians, according to S. Jerom, as if they could be ignorant of this circumstance. C.—Grabe supplies, “thou wast directed to the kingdom.” H.  
**15** *Renown*, or name; thus dishonouring me, thy husband. Is. 4:1.  
**16** *Places:* pavilions, (A. Lap. 4 K. 17:30. C.) or idols stuffed, (S. Jer. Theod.) and outwardly adorned. Such might easily be procured or removed. 1 K. 19:13.—*Hereafter*, with impunity. The Jews were guilty of greater ingratitude than other nations.  
**17** *My g* *old*, for the temple, or thy most precious ornaments, which were sacrificed to gratify thy lubricity, ( C.) or to form the golden calf, &c. Ex. 32. H.—Obscene representations were also used in the worship of Osiris. Herod. ii. 48.  
**18** *Oil*, or perfume. which no man was allowed to use. Ex. 30:9. 38.  
**20** *Thy sons:* so he calls them to shew his indignation, though he acknowledges them for his, (v. 21) to enhance the crime. Who could have thought that such cruel sacrifices would ever take place! 4 K. 23. C.—Adulteresses bring in the children of others; but the Jews sacrifice their own to idols. 4 K. 16. &c. W.  
**25** *Sign;* altars of idols. H.—She makes no secret of her apostacy. The Greeks and Romans marked the houses of prostitutes, that honest men might avoid them. “The deemed the *pr* *ofession* of such a crime a sufficient punishment to repress impure women.” Tacit. Annal.  
**26** *Bodies.* Lit. “flesh.” H. Juv. ix. 34. M.—The Egyptians are tall, but meagre. Valle. Ep. xi.—They were the most dissolute in their worship, and corrupted most other nations as well as the Jews. C. 20:8 and 23:3.  
**27** *Justification;* law, &c. Heb. “thy right,” or allowance. Ex. 21:10.—*Hate thee.* To be abandoned to the will of a rival, is most dreadful for a woman. The Jews were subjected to the nations which they had despised, as they are still to Christians. Even other less favoured idolaters were astonished ( C.) at their apostacy. H.  
**28** *Assyrians*, adoring the sun, Baal, &c. C.  
**31** *Price*, before she will yield, ( H.) or who follow such practices for a livelihood. C.—Heb. “in that thou scornest hire.” Prot. Sept. “gathering rewards.” The difference consisted in Jerusalem’s sinning through mere wantonness, and even to her loss.  
**34** *Fornication* unpunished, or comparable with thine. v. 16. H.—All such actions are abominable; but still more so, when the woman solicts. W.  
**36** *Money.* Lit. “brass,” ( H.) to adorn idols. C.—Prot. “thy filthiness;” ( H.) *virus.* Pagn. &c. C.  
**37** **V** **er.** **37** **.** *Nakedness.* Friends and enemies ( H.) saw that idols afforded no protection. C. 6:3. Jer. 13:26.  
**38** *Judge;* punish thee by stoning to death. Lev. 20:10. The walls of the Jews were battered to the ground.  
**39** *House;* the temple, which thou hast profaned, and the high places. The idols shall be plundered, in which thou hast trusted.  
**41** *Women:* nations assembled against Jerusalem.  
**42** *No more.* I will entirely repudiate thee, so as to observe thy conduct no longer, ( C.) with the eyes of an husband. H.—This is the most terrible effect of God’s wrath, ( C.) when the sinner is left to himself. Osee 4:14. S. Jer.  
**43** *Youth*, when thou wast destitute, (v. 4) and more grateful for my favours, Jeremias 2:2.—*Head.* I have punished thee, yet not as thy *deeds* require. H.  
**44** *Daughter.* They too commonly ( C.) follow bad parents. Juv. vi. 239. and xiv. 25.—Jerusalem is more wicked than the Cethite, ( H.) her mother, v. 3. C.—Even this nation had once received the principles of the true religion for the patriarchs, but *cast* them *off* to embrace idolatry, and to destroy her *children.* H.—Jerusalem was formerly and is till wicked. W.  
**46** *Right:* southward.—*Sodom.* The city was more ancient than Jerusalem. Hence it here designates Ruben, ( H.) and the Jews east of the Jordan; (Prado) or rather Moab and Ammon, (v. 55. C.) and the rest of the Gentiles. H.—Samaria shewed Jerusalem the road to idolatry, and therefore is called her elder sister. The number of the ten tribes was also greater than that of the kingdom of Juda, which became corrupt as *Sodom*, only by degrees. Theod.  
**47** *Ways*, but hast done even worse.—*Almost.* He seems to diminish their crimes, ( C.) as if it could hardly be believed that Jerusalem should be more abandoned. Heb. and Sept. “that would be but little: yea, thou hast done more,” &c. H.  
**49** *Sodom*, &c. That is, these were the steps by which the Sodomites came to fall into those abominations for which they were destroyed. For pride, gluttony, and idleness, are the high road to all kinds of lust; especially when they are accompanied with a neglect of the works of mercy. Ch.—These crimes alone are great enough; (Lu. 16:19) and the prophets never accuse the Jews of unnatural lust. Hence Ezechiel takes no notice of it here, as he probably refers to the manners of the Moabites, &c. who were then living. Is. 16:6. C.—Abundance and idleness produce crimes; temperance and labour bring forth good fruit. W.  
**50** *Seen.* This would seem to allude to the Israelites beyond the Jordan, who had been led away into Assyria. The Moabites, &c. beheld the downfall of Jerusalem, ( H.) and were treated in like manner, only five years later. Jos. Jer. 48. &c.  
**51** *Justified*, as they are comparatively innocent. S. Aug. c. Faust. xxii. 61.—They had not the like advantages, (Mat. 11:23) nor the example of others’ punishment to open their eyes. Thou hast pleaded for or with them, and hast lost thy cause. C.  
**53** *Back*, &c. This relates to the conversion of the Gentiles out of all nations, and of many of the Jews, to the Church of Christ. Ch.—Cyrus also liberated the tribes on the east as well as on the west of the Jordan, ( H.) and in general all the captive nations. C.—*And restore.* Heb. “the captivity, even the captivity of Sodom.” Sept. “I will turn away their aversions, the,” &c. I will give them a more docile spirit.  
**54** *Them.* It affords some consolation to have partners in misery. C.  
**55** *Ancient state.* That is, to their former state of liberty, and their ancient possessions. In the spiritual sense, to the true liberty and the happy inheritance of the children of God, through faith in Christ. Ch.—All will be treated alike, whether Jew or Gentile. H.—When Sodom or the Gentiles shall have embraced the gospel, then also will the Jews. Rom. 10. W.  
**56** *Pride.* Thou scornedst to mention her, (Ps. 15:4. C.) or wouldst not take warning. S. Jer.  
**59** *Covenant* at Sinai, or under Josue. 8. Ex. 19:7.  
**60** *Covenant.* After punishing thee I will fulfill my promises, as we see was done ( C.) after the captivity, and ( H.) in the Christian Church. C.—All shall be converted, not by the Jewish but by the evangelical covenant. W.  
**61** *Daughters.* The countries were conquered by the Machabees. All nations embrace the gospel.—*Covenant.* It is broken. I will, out of pity, re-establish it, or a better, to last for ever under Christ, free from the servitude and fear of the old law. C.

## Chapter 17

**2** *Riddle.* Thus the prophets and Christ often delivered their doctrine. C.  
**3** *A large eagle.* Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon. Ch.—The multitude of his subjects, and his rapid and cruel conquests, are designated. C.—He spoils the vineyard of Jerusalem, notwithstanding the Jews had applied to another eagle, the king of Egypt. v. 12. W.—*Libanus* *.* That is, Jerusalem; ( Ch.) or invaded the country, ( C.) entering by Libanus. H.—*Cedar.* King Jechonias Ch. and his nobles, (4 Kin. 24:11) with the most precious effects.  
**4** *Twigs.* The young king and his officers, who had scarcely got established. C.—Chanaan. This name, which signifies traffic, is not taken here for Palestine, but for Chaldea; and the city of merchants here mentioned is Babylon. Ch.—It was so corrupt as to deserve this appellation, as Rome was afterwards styled Babylon. Its situation was very favourable to traffic, and its dominions were very extensive. C.  
**5** *Land.* Sedecias, whom he made king. Ch.—He was brother of the dethroned king, and have every prospect of reigning long, if he had proved faithful. C.  
**6** *Towards him.* Nabuchodonosor, to whom Sedecias swore allegiance. Ch.—Lit. “to it,” *eam*, the eagle. H.—The dominions of Sedecias were extensive, but weak, and dependant on a foreign king.  
**7** *Eagle.* The king of Egypt, ( Ch.) Vaphres, who came at the request of Sedecias, to oppose the Chaldeans, but was routed; and they returned to the siege of Jerusalem. Jer. 37:4.—*Plantation*, as the waters of the Nile were conducted to different parts by ditches. Deut. 11:10.  
**9** *Prosper.* Will God countenance perfidy? C.—“Faith must be kept even with enemies.” S. Jer.—*Arm.* The conquest did not cost the Chaldeans much. Sedecias fled by night, but was soon taken. 4 K. 25:6. C.  
**12** *Shal* *l*, or, “hath taken,” &c. Ch. as also (v. 13.) Sedecias was seized five years after. C. 8:1. Jechonias, the *princes, mighty* warriors, (v. 13) and expert artists, had been taken away six years before, with the prophet. Prot. “is come, … and hath taken,” &c. H.  
**16** *Die.* He had sworn fidelity, and was justly punished, dying blind, and in prison. C. 12. W.  
**17** *Souls.* Some refer this to Pharao; others to the enemy. The former did not attempt to surround the besiegers, but after losing a battle retired. C. 30:21. C.  
**18** *Hand.* Swearing perhaps to both ( H.) the Egyptian and to the Chaldean monarch.  
**20** *Net.* C. 12:13. C.—*Judge*, punish. H.—His sentence was pronounced at Reblatha. 4 Kin. 25:7. C.  
**22** *Cedar.* Of the Royal stock of David.—*Twig.* Jesus Christ, whom God hath planted in Mount Sion, that is, the high mountain of his Church, to which all nations flow. Ch.—The Jews in vain apply this to Zorobabel or to the Machabees. Their power was never great enough to verify these expressions. C.—But Christ has united in his Church all the *birds*, or those who have strength enough to raise themselves above earthly things. S. Jer. Theod. &c.—The kingdom of Sedecias and that of Nabuchodonosor prospered not, or was soon at an end: Christ remains for ever. W.  
**24** *High* and *green* denote Sedecias; *low and dry* Jechonias, who was exalted at Babylon, while his rival was hurled down from his present high estate. The prophets speak of that as past, which God has decreed. See Jer. 22:30. C.

## Chapter 18

**2** *Edge.* Those in captivity would not allow that they were punished for their own sins: God convinces them of the contrary. W.—They knew that he often visited the sins of the fathers upon the children, (Ex. 20:5 and 24:5. C.) when they also *hated* him, ( H.) and that many had suffered for their parents’ faults, like those of Saul, David, &c. C.—But these were all guilty of original sin at least, and death is not always a real misfortune. H.—God seems to allow that the complaints had hitherto had some grounds, (Jer. 31) but that they should be removed after the captivity, and still more effectually by the death of Christ, who came to redeem sinners, and rejected none. By baptism he cancels original sin, the *sour grape*, and those who cannot receive it are not innocent. C.—God chastises the body, but not the soul of children, for their parents’ faults: ( M.) and this conduct is a trial for them, which may increase their glory. H.  
**4** *Mine.* He insinuates the vocation of the Gentiles and the general redemption. All will be treated according to their works. C.  
**6** *Mountains:* of the sacrifices there offered to idols; ( Ch.) or partaken in their usual feasts. Some irregularly worshipped God in these high places, under many pious kings; and were tolerated, ( C.) though condemned for so doing. H.—*Woman.* The pagans abstained by the light of reason. C.—The contrary practice, “it is said,” would give rise to lepers or monsters, (S. Jer.) as experience evinces. C.—It was forbidden in the Christian Church. S. Aug. q. 64. in Lev. 20:18. S. Greg. resp. 10. ad Aug. C.—But no such questions are now asked. The prophet insists on this no more. v. 11, 15.  
**7** *Wronged.* Lit. “constristated.” H.—Heb. “oppressed,” maliciously.  
**8** *Increase* more than what he lent, on any pretext. S. Jer. C.  
**10** *Robber.* Heb. “breaker;” rude and lawless. Sept. “pestilent.”  
**12** *Abomination.* This refers to the *woman*, (v. 6) or to idolatry.  
**13** *Him.* He alone is answerable, and shall suffer.  
**20** *Sinneth.* God never acted otherwise, though the Jews seem to have thought so. Temporal afflictions are the source of merit, and generally fall to the share of the saints, particularly under the new law.  
**21** *Penance.* The end determines all. If a person be then found just or unjust at his departure, he will be treated accordingly. W.  
**23** *Will.* God sincerely wishes that the sinner should be converted. If he refuse grace, it is only in punishment of former transgressions. S. Aug. ep. 217.—He wills antecedently their salvation, (1 Tim. 2:4) though he has a consequent will to punish them, as they speak in the schools, because they themselves will not be saved. Sanct. C.—God’s absolute will is always fulfilled, not that which is conditional. S. Jo. Dam. (Fide ii. 29.) S. Tho. p. 1. q. 19. a. 6.—He does enough by offering his graces and the death of Christ, to shew that his will is sincere; though by a consequent will his justice punishes the impenitent. Thus a virtuous judge would have all to observe the laws and live: but finding some transgress, so as to become pernicious, he punishes them with death. W.  
**24** *Remembered*, to procure him pardon; yet he will suffer less than if he had never done any good. C.  
**25** *Not right*, in thus punishing or rewarding for the last act; (Theod.) or rather, God shews that those who complain are guilty.  
**27** **Ver** **.** **27** **.** *Alive.* Mortal sin destroys that life of grace. C.  
**30** *Do penance.* This is requisite, as well as a change of conduct. W.  
**31** *New.* We can do no good of ourselves: but we are admonished of our free-will, that we may do what we can, and ask for grace. Trid. Ses. vi. 5. 11. Jam. 1:5 and 2 Cor. 3:5. S. Aug. &c.) C.

## Chapter 19

**1** *Princes:* sons of Josias, who were so wretched. The latter part of this beautiful canticle, or allegory, (v. 10) regards Sedecias. C.  
**2** *Lioness;* Jerusalem ( Ch.) which made alliances with the *lions*, or nations. C.  
**3** *Whelps;* Joachaz, or Sellum, ( Ch.) who reigned only three months, like his brother Jechonias. H.—The four last kings were all cruel. W.  
**4** *But.* Heb. “he was taken in their pit,” (Prot. H.) as also v. 8. Sept. “in his or their corruption.” We do not read that Joachaz fought, ( C.) though this passage insinuates as much. Sanct. 4 K. 23:30. &c.  
**5** *Lions:* Joakim. Ch.—He reigned eleven years; but was such a monster, that the prophet does not speak of him or bewail his fate. 4 K. 23:34. Jer. 22:19. His words are applicable to Jechonias alone; who was cruel and banished to Babylon. v. 8. C.  
**8** *Nations:* rovers of Chaldea, Syria, &c. 4 K. 24:2. W.—*Wounds.* Heb. “pit.” He was besieged, (4 K. 24:11. C.) and gave himself up. H.  
**10** *Blood.* She has given birth to many kings. M.—The original may be inaccurate, and perhaps should be, “a vine-tree *or* branch:” ( C.) *cormoc* instead of bedammecha. Sept. read kerimmon, “like a rose-flower,” planted, &c. H.—He speaks of Sedecias more obscurely. C.—The kingdom had flourished under David and Solomon. It afterwards lost its splendour under wicked kings, and all the tribes were removed. W.  
**11** **1** **.** *Rods.* The king had many children, and confided in them, but they were slain.  
**13** *Dry;* unfit for vine-trees. He speaks of the prison of Babylon. C.—The country was naturally wet. H.  
**14** *Fi* *re.* Ismael, who slew Godolias, was of the royal family. Jer. 41. &c. C.

## Chapter 20

**1** *Month:* A. 3411, Aug. 27. Usher.—Ezechiel had prophesied in the fourth year; they was silent a year and two months, or 430 days. He opened his mouth again in the sixth year, (C. 8:1) and now in the seventh year he is ordered not to answer. W.—We know not what the *ancients* wanted to know; but their design was evil. C.  
**4** *Judgest them;* or, if thou wilt enter into the cause, and plead against them. Ch.—Lay before them the iniquities of their fathers, and their own, which bring on the reprobation of the greatest part. God will form his Church out of a few of them and of the Gentiles. The return of a small number from captivity is also insinuated.  
**6** *Excelleth.* Heb. “is beauty *or* a desire.” Sept. “honeycomb.” C.  
**7** *Scandals*, &c. (*offensiones*) that is, the abominations or idols, to the worship of which they were allured by their eyes. Ch.—Moses found them in this condition in Egypt, and he could not entirely reclaim them. C.—Many still secreted their idols. C. 23:1. Acts 7:42. H.  
**8** *Egypt.* Their disorders called for such severity. But God was restrained by the dangers ( C.) of blasphemy, &c. to which the faithful and idolaters would thus have been exposed. H.—He saved them as he had promised, though they did not deserve it. W.  
**10** *Brought.* Lit. “cast,” ( H.) as if they had been reluctant.  
**11** *Live*, and enjoy temporal felicity, which was chief promised, though the faithful observers of the law would obtain an eternal reward.  
**12** *Sign*, as also to promote piety and instruction.  
**13** *Sabbaths.* We only read of one man gathering sticks, and the people manna once on those days. Ex. 15 and 16. But Moses does not mention all. C.—Sabbath often denotes the whole law, which they transgressed; and as long as they retained an affection for idols, they could not observe the sabbaths so as to please God.  
**14** *But.* Lit. “And I did for,” &c. This motive caused me to spare them. H.—I punished only the most guilty adorers of the calf, and murmurers, &c. Num. 14:28. C.—Some were always preserved for a succession. v. 9, 22. W.  
**23** *Again*, or also. H.—Four times are specified v. 13, 15, 21 which may allude to the adoration of the calf, the graves of concupiscence, the murmuring, and commerce with the women and idols of Moab. Ex. 23. Num. 10 and 14 and 25. C.  
**25** *Not good.* The laws and ordinances of their enemies: or those imposed upon them by that cruel tyrant the devil, to whose power they were delivered up for their sins; ( Ch.) which may be styled *the statutes of your fathers*, &c. v. 18. H.—God is often said to do what he only permits. C.—He abandoned them to their own perversity. S. Jer. Deut. 32:21. 37.—If God had spoken of the Decalogue, &c. would he say such laws were *not good*, after he had testified that the observers *shall live in them?* v. 11. He established the ceremonial law, at the same time. See Kimchi. M. &c. Chal. “I have given them up to their foolish desires. They have established bad statutes and laws which will not give them life.” This seems the best explanation. C.—Heb. “Have I given … (26) and have I polluted them?” &c. Manasse Ben. Israel. The precepts had also a bad effect, and were given in condescension to the weakness of the people, (Orig.) particularly the ceremonial part. S. Just. S. Chrys. S. Jer. &c.—They did not justify, (S. Aug.) and were *not good*, compared with those of the new law. S. Greg. mor. xxviii. 9.—Thus Solon gave the Athenians “the best laws that they would receive,” (Plut.) though others more perfect might have been devised. C.  
**26** *I polluted them*, &c. That is, I gave them up to such blindness, in punishment of their offences, as to pollute themselves with the blood of all their first-born, whom they offered up to their idols in compliance with their wicked devices. Ch. M. Lev. 18:21 and 4 Kin. 3 ultr. and 21:6. C.—*Offered.* Prot. “caused to pass through *the fire* all,” &c. C. 16:21.—*For their.* Prot. “that I might make them desolate to the end, that,” &c.  
**29** *Called high.* Heb. “Bamah,” ( H.) out of contempt. C.—The Jews were so much attached to the high places, that they called the altar of the Lord by the same name. Thus heretics are convicted by the very names they use, calling sacrifice *service*, &c. W.  
**32** *Stones.* This was the secret intention of the *ancients*, (v. 1. H.) and of many in captivity, who were only praise-worthy compared with those at Jerusalem. C. 11:15.  
**33** *Out.* I will not allow you to follow idols with impunity. C.  
**35** *Of people.* That is, a desert, in which there are no people; ( Ch.) meaning Judea, to which they should return.  
**37** *Covenant* of the gospel, by the powerful attractions of grace. Lu. 14:24. Jo. 6:69 and 7:46 and 2 Cor. 10:4.  
**38** *Israel.* They shall continue in exile; or the rebel Jews who will not believe in Christ, shall be cast off. C.  
**39** *Walk*, &c. It is not an allowance, much less a commandment to serve idols; but a figure of speech, by which God would have them to understand, that if they would walk after their idols, they must not pretend to serve him at the same time: for that he would by no means suffer such a mixture of worship. Ch. S. Jer.—Continue, if you dare, to serve idols. I will still bring you back. C.—Sept. “take away each your devices; and then if you hear me, (Grabe’s copy adds, *not*) and defile not my,” &c. H.—God would rather have idolaters leave him wholly, than halt between two, (3 K. 18) neither hot nor cold; (Apoc. 3) for such dishonour God’s name the most. Rom. 2:24. W.  
**40** *Mountain.* The foregoing verse, to make the sense complete, must be understood so as to condemn and reject that mixture of worship which the Jews then followed. In this verse God promises to the true Israelites, especially to those of the Christian Church, that they should serve him in another manner in his holy mountain, the spiritual Sion, and shall be accepted of by him. Ch.  
**43** *Committed.* This is a picture of the converts to Christianity. C.  
**46** *Of the south.* Jerusalem lay towards the south of Babylon, where the prophet then was, and is here called *the forest of the south field*, and is threatened with utter desolation. Ch. See C. 21. C.—In Jerusalem there were good and bad. W.  
**47** *Burned*, with war and famine. Jer. 21:14. C.—*North*, from Egypt to Mesopotamia. Theod.—Nabuchodonosor invaded those parts. H.  
**49** *Par* *ables.* They were easy enough to understand, but the Jews would not comprehend them no more than our Saviour’s words. Jo. 10:24. C.

## Chapter 21

**3** *Just.* But had not God declared the contrary, C. 18? The time was not yet arrived; or, he rescued the just from death, though he permitted them to experience the other common miseries. C.—He preserved them from eternal death. E.—The *just* often means those who are so only in appearance. C. 16:51. C.—Temporal afflictions fall upon all; but the just derive benefit from them, while the wicked fall into eternal misery. S. Jer. W.  
**4** *North*, including all the country belonging to Israel.  
**5** *Back*, (v. 30) without doing execution. Jer. 50:9. C.  
**6** *Bitterness.* Sept. “pains,” like those of child-bearing. Is. 21:3.  
**7** *Melt.* Lit. “decay.” Jos. 7. &c.—*Knee.* C. 7:17. H.  
**10** *My son.* He speaks, according to S. Jerom, to the *sword* of Nabuchodonosor; which was about to remove the sceptre of Israel, whom God here calls his *son.* Ch.—This title belonged to all Israel. Ex. 4:22. W.—The Heb. seems to be corrupt, and we may adhere to the Vulg. or to the Sept. ( C.) which has, (9,) “Sword be sharp, and raging to slay victims; be sharp to shine, ready for destruction; cut, reduce to nothing, remove all wood.” H.—Syr. “be ready to scatter the race of my son,” &c. Heb. “Where shall we rejoice, sceptre of my son, thou *sword* which despisest every tree?” C.—Prot. “It contemneth the rod of my son *as* every tree?” H.  
**11** *Slayer.* He had conquered many nations before he attacked Israel. Let none boast of being the scourges of the Lord.  
**12** *Fled*, with Sedecias, by night.—*Thigh*, in surprise and grief. v. 17.  
**13** *God.* Perhaps you will say it is only a trial: but what will be your sentiments, when you behold the king and his people led away? C.—Prot. “Because it is a trial; and what if *the sword* contemn even the rod? it shall be no *more*, saith.” H.  
**14** *Tripled.* Let the war be very bloody. Nabuchodonosor often invaded Judea. C.—He raised the siege, but returned. Vat.  
**15** *Ready.* Lit. “covered,” (*amicti* *.* H.) in the scabbard, and quite new and sharp.  
**20** *Rabbath.* They had formed a league with Sedecias, and Nabuchodonosor thought of punishing them first. H.—But they joined his forces. Jer. 12:6 and 27:3.  
**21** *Shuffling.* Heb. “polishing.” Syr. &c. “shooting an arrow upwards.” He was undetermined which to attack first, and perhaps wrote Jerusalem on one and Rabbath on another arrow; (S. Jer. &c. C.) or which way the arrow fell the army followed. H.—Many nations have adopted such superstitious practices.—*Idols.* Heb. Teraphim*.* Gen. 31:19. C.—*Entrails.* The Chaldeans taught the Lydians and they the Tuscans. Grot.—At first this was done only to see if the victims were sound. Cic. Div.  
**22** *Right* of one going by Thapsacus and Damascus, and not through the Desert Arabia, for thus Rabbath would have been to the right. God permitted this divination to succeed in his wrath. The devil pushed the Chaldeans forward, lest the Jews might be converted. C.—I they had attacked Rabbath first, they would probably have succeeded, as they did five years after. But the time of vengeance was come for Jerusalem, ( H.) and they were directed to assault it. W.—*Voice:* the din of war, ( H.) or of soldiers, trumpets, &c.  
**23** *Vain.* They shall think that Nabuchodonosor is wasting his time.—*Sabbaths.* Heb. “they have people who swear to them;” false prophets, or the Egyptians, on whom they depend. Sept. “and counting the weeks,” like Aman. Est. 3:7.—*Iniquity*, or perfidy of Sedecias. C. 17:15. C.  
**24** *Remembered.* Heb. “caused … to be remembered,” ( H.) sinning publicly. C.  
**25** *Thou profane*, &c. He speaks to king Sedecias, who had broken his oath, and was otherwise a wicked prince. Ch.—Heb. “Criminal, (sentenced to die) wicked,” &c. C.  
**26** *Diadem*, (*cidarim* *.*) Some think this was th ornament of the high priest, (S. Jer. Chal.) denoting that he should perish as well as the king. H.—*This.* The royal crown of Juda had exalted Sedecias from a private state and condition to the sovereign power, as the loss of it brought down Jechonias, &c. Ch.—It shall be given go Godolias. Chal. Heb. “it is not ( H.) *or* shall be no more” the same, or for the posterity of Sedecias. None of the tribe of Juda was truly king after him, till the Messias. Sanct. T. &c. Gen. 49:10. C.  
**27** *Iniquity.* Or, I will overturn it, viz. the crown of Juda, for the manifold iniquities of the kings: but it shall not be utterly removed till Christ come, whose right it is; and who shall reign in the spiritual house of Jacob (that is, in his Church,) for evermore. Ch.—Heb. also, “sideways.” Thou shalt no more wear the tiara erect, ( H.) like a king: (Hesyc.) or rather, thy iniquity or punishment shall be most grievous.—*Him;* Christ, or ( C.) Nabuchodonosor. Vat. M.  
**28** *Reproach*, by which they had reproached and insulted over the Jews, at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem. Ch. C. 25:6. Soph. 2:8.—They were punished five years later ( C.) by the same Babylonians whom they had encouraged. W.  
**30** *Sheath.* The sword of Babylon, after raging against many nations, was shortly to be judged and destroyed at home by the Medes and Persians. Ch.—After Nabuchodonosor had chastised the nations around for 18 years, after the ruin of Jerusalem, he returned and died in peace. Yet he first became like a beast. v. 31. Dan. 4:30. The rest of the prophecy regards his successors. Cyrus waged war upon them, and Baltassar was slain in a conspiracy. See Is. 47. Jer. 50. C.—At last the sword fell upon Babylon itself. W.  
**31** *Brutish*, or devoid of sense. H.—Heb. “burning;” smiths. C.

**2** *Blood.* Why dost thou cease to admonish and rebuke the people? W.—Pronounce sentence on Jerusalem, ( H.) for her cruelties. C.  
**6** *Hath.* Sept. “was mixed with his relations,” v. 10. &c. ( H.) fighting against them. Theod.  
**8** *Sabbaths*, by servile works, and by their sinful deportment.  
**9** *Slanderers*, hateful to all. Lev. 19:16. Prov. 11:13.—*Mountains.* C. 18:6.  
**10** *Father*, his widow, their mother-in-law, or one of his wives.  
**12** *Increase.* C. 18:18. C.—*Me.* “The remembrance of God excludes all sins.” S. Jer.  
**13** *Hands*, through surprise and sorrow. C.—God wishes the sinner’s salvation. Gen. 6:6. W.  
**15** *In thee.* I will purify thee by violent medicines. C.  
**16** *Possess*, “as an inheritance:” (Sept. H.) “I will defile:” (Aq.) “wound thee.” Sym. Heb. is very different: ( C.) “thou hast inherited in thyself,” ( H.) being no longer willing to be subject.  
**18** *Dross.* Heb. “a mixture.” Sept. “God will purify the silver.” Is. 4:4.  
**24** *Raine* *d upon*, or watered with the instructions of the prophets. C. 20:46.  
**25** *Conspiracy.* The false prophets defend each other, ( C.) while the priests connive at their proceedings, ( H.) and set the example of wickedness.  
**28** *Without.* Sept. “they shall fall, seeing,” &c.  
**30** *None* like Abraham, Moses, &c. C.—The prayers of the just are very powerful; and God wishes them to exert themselves for sinners. S. Jer.om. W.

## Chapter 23

**3** *Fornication.* That is, idolatry. Ch.—*Down.* Virgins used the stomacher, or ( H.) *fascia pectoralis* *.* Is. 3:24. This chapter resembles the 16th. C.  
**4** *Oolla and Ooliba* *.* God calls the kingdom of Israel Oolla, which signifies *their own habitation*, because they separated themselves from his temple; and the kingdom of Juda Ooliba, which signifies *his habitation in her*, because of his temple among them in Jerusalem. Ch.—The ten tribes first gave way to idolatry, and were more numerous. C.—In Egypt the people were united, yet abandoned to idolatry in their youth, when they were only beginning to increase. Afterwards the ten tribes set up altars for themselves, at Dan and Bethel. W.  
**5** *Assyrians.* That is, the idols of the Assyrians: for all that is said in this chapter of the fornications of Israel and Juda, is to be understood in a spiritual sense of their disloyalty to the Lord, by worshipping strange gods. Ch. W.—The Assyrians taught the worship of Baal, the high places, &c. The Egyptians also promoted their abominations. C.  
**6** *Blue*, or purple. This was reserved for the principal nobility.  
**8** *Egypt.* They always retained an affection for those idols, the calf, Adonis, &c.  
**10** *Disgrace:* satisfying their passions. v. 29. C.—*Women.* Having once lost all sense of decorum, they became more abandoned. H.  
**11** *This;* not chastisement, but dissolution.  
**14** *Colours.* She was enamoured at the account or picture of these people, without ever having seen them.  
**16** *Messengers.* Achaz invited the Assyrians, and imitated their altars, &c. 4 K. 16:2. &c. C.—The Chaldeans afterwards possessed the country. H.  
**17** *Love.* Lit. “of breasts,” as Heb. also signifies. Here it denotes the temples. M.  
**19** *Remembering*, or “causing to be remembered” by God, who seemed to have forgotten those ancient scenes of wickedness. C. 21:24.  
**20** *Asses.* He means the Egyptians, (C. 16:26) in whom the kings of Juda trusted. C.  
**22** *About.* The Philistines, Ammonites, &c. shall join the Chaldees, ( H.) and Egypt shall desert the Jews in their greatest need. C.  
**23** *Nobles.* Prot. “Pekod, and Shoah, and Roa:” ( H.) which Junius takes to be the three great divisions of the empire. Others suppose they denote the dignities, though they occur not in Daniel.—*Captains.* Heb. “Phachat, and Saganim, (v. 6, 12) and Schalischim:” officers mentioned Ex. 14:7 and 2 K. 23:8.—*Renowned*, called to the assemblies and councils of the princes. Num. 1:16. C.—*Horsemen.* Prot. “all of them riding upon horses.” H.  
**24** *Judgments*, at Reblatha. 4 K. 25:6.  
**25** **Ve** **r.** **25** **.** *Jealousy*, the most violent of passions. C.—So the Chaldees are styled, as Assur is *the rod.* Is. 10:5. W.—*Ears*, the punishment of adulteresses: both king and priests suffer. S. Jer.—Thus the captives were probably treated. C. See Sen. Ira. iii. 20.—*Fire*, by Ismahel. C. 19:14.  
**26** *Glory;* vanity, or of the temple. C. 16:17. Osee 2:4.  
**31** *Cup.* Thou shalt be punished like Samaria, dreadfully. 4 K. 17:4. C.  
**34** *Fragments*, as drunkards sometimes bite ( H.) the cup in their rage.—*Rend.* What had been the occasion of thy fall: ( C.) *pectori planxi* *.* Ovid ep. 5.  
**36** *Deeds.* He is thus admonished to condemn them; (C. 20:4) as times and places tended to aggravate their crimes, v. 39. W.  
**40** *Paint*, with antimony. Sept. See 4 K. 9:3.  
**41** *Bed:* it seems at table. Amos 2:8. Tob. 2:3.—*Ointment;* using them for thyself, or presenting them to idols. Ex. 30:23 and 33. C.  
**42** *And that.* Prot. “Sabeans (marg. and Sept. drunkards) from,” &c. Any were admitted ( H.) to the priesthood and to her favours, even the most rustic and deformed. 3 K. 12:32.  
**45** *Just*, compared with the Jews, whom they shall chastise. C.  
**47** *Stones*, like adulteresses. C. 16:38. Lev. 20:10. H.—Let the walls be demolished. C.

## Chapter 24

**1** *Month;* Jan. 30, A. 3414. Usher.—Ezechiel was then in Mesopotamia, when the news of the siege commencing on that very day, should arrive; it would make a great impression upon the people, so that they would have confidence in him, ( C.) as the certainty of the prediction would appear. 4 K. 25:1. W.  
**2** *Pot*, to denote Jerusalem: the *flesh* boiled and consumed in the fire with the *bones*, would shew the future dismal condition of its chiefs and inhabitants. H.—The hardened Jews turned such things to ridicule. C. 11:3.  
**4** *Choice.* Heb. “the choice of the bones,” or the finest pieces separated from the bones, as the Sept. and the sequel seem to require. C.—The bones might serve to burn. v. 5. H. See S. Jer. Vat. &c. C.  
**5** *The*, &c. Lit. “its boiling has grown hot;” the citizens suffer terribly.—*Bones.* Heb. hatsamim, ( H.) may denote the more solid meat.  
**6** *Rust:* the inveterate malice of the city. v. 12.—*Upon it.* Hurl the pieces of meat out of the pot, without any choice. C.—All the people shall feel my indignation, the rich as well as the poor. v. 13. H.  
**7** *She hath.* Sept. “I have let it corrupt upon. I have not,” &c. (v. 8. H.) as if God spoke. The Jews had committed murder without fear. They had naturally a horror for blood, and the law ordered even that of beasts to be covered. Lev. 17:13. Now innocent blood cries for vengeance. Gen. 4:10. The punishment shall be as visible as the crime. v. 8.  
**10** *And the.* Heb. “put in the seasoning and the bones,” &c.  
**13** *Thy.* Heb. “In thy crime there is design,” or malice. This rendered the Jews so hateful ( C.) and irreclaimable. H.—God had given them abundant instructions ( C.) and graces; but all was contemned. H.—When the fire of tribulation does not amend sinners, they are sentenced to hell fire. W.  
**16** *Stroke;* pestilence, or sudden death. This would make the loss of a dear wife still more afflicting. Yet such distress will fall upon the whole nation, ( C.) and misery shall increase so much, that a private loss will be almost forgotten. H.—*Curæ leves loquuntur, graviores silent* *.* Sen. Troad.—When a loss is foreseen, it is more easily borne. Private calamities sink in public ones. W.  
**17** *Silence*, for such manifold calamities, if thou canst screen thyself from the enemy, who will otherwise take offence, as he has brought them on. H.—*Dead.* Priests were allowed to mourn only for father or mother, and their unmarried brothers and sisters. Lev. 21:1. Ezechiel (44:25) adds, *Son and daughter.* Many think the wife must also be understood, as she is nearer than a brother. The reasons for these prohibitions did not then subsist, as no sacrifice could be offered in Chaldea; and therefore God here specifies what the prophet was not to do, ( C.) though lawful on other occasions. Sanct.—*Tire.* Lit. “crown,” bandage, ( C.) or parchment, on which parts of the law were written. Sept. “Let (Rom. ed. adds, not) the hair of thy head be curled (or ruffed; συμπεπλεγμενον) upon thee.” H.—It was usually cut in mourning. S. Jer.—*Feet.* They were bare, at funerals, and in times of sorrow. 2 K. 15:30.—*Face*, like David. Heb. “the upper lip,” which mourners and lepers covered. Lev. 13:45. C.—*Mourners.* Feasts were prepared by the relations, (Jos. Bel. ii. 1.) and friends sent some food, but no delicacies, to those who mourned. Lev. 5:9.  
**21** *Profane*, or esteem it no more, ( H.) but abandon it to the Gentiles. C.—*Feareth* to lose; or on which it rests. v. 25. H.  
**27** *No more*, if thou darest to speak before the Chaldeans. v. 17. Reserve thy tears and lamentations for that time. C.

**2** **Ver.** **2–3** **.** Ammon*.* These nations were punished five years after the Jews. C. 21:19. Jer. 27:3. C.—“Egypt, Syria, Phœnicia, and Arabia,” were conquered. Beros.—*Hast.* God saw their dispositions, which they manifested afterwards. C.—They rejoiced most, and were therefore punished with other nations. W.  
**4** *East;* the Chaldeans, (Sanct.) who conquered them, ( H.) though the Scenite Arabs, who occupied the country after the inhabitants were removed, or the Armenians and Agarens, are rather meant than the Chaldees. W.  
**5** *Rabbath*, the capital city of the Ammonites: it was afterwards called *Philadelphia.* Ch.—*Flocks.* These constituted the riches of those Arabians.  
**7** Lord, and that it was not through impotence that my people became a prey. Ammon and Moab returned after some time. v. 10. C. 16:53. Jer. 49:6.  
**8** *Seir;* Idumea.—*Nations*, whose gods could not defend them. C.—Thus they blasphemed the Lord. Theod.  
**9** *Shoulder;* reduce to slavery, ( H.) or take the strong places, (Jer. 48:7. C.) or cities and strength of Moab. W.  
**10** *With*, or “like thee.” Moab (v. 11) shall be treated like Ammon. H.—Heb. “As for the,” &c. C.  
**12** *Revenge;* exhorting the Chaldeans to destroy utterly, (Ps. 136:7) and seizing every opportunity of injuring the Jews. 2 Par. 28:18. Amos 1:11.  
**13** *South.* Heb. “Theman,” a city at one extremity. The Chaldeans laid waste the country, (C. 32:29) but did not remove the people, who seized the southern parts of Juda, till they were forced to submit to the Machabees.  
**15** *Enmities.* They also watched every moment to injure the Jews, Amos 1:5. But Nabuchodonosor was irritated, because they had assisted Tyre. Jer. 47:4.  
**16** *Killers.* Heb. “Ceretheans.” David’s guards were of this nation. 2 K. 8:18. They came originally from Crete; and the Sept. have here, “Cretans;” ( C.) as Grabe substitutes for “Judges of Sidon.” H.—Chal. “archers.”—*Remnant.* They deserve not the name of a nation, having been much reduced by Egypt and the Chaldeans. C.

## Chapter 26

**1** *Year* of the prophet’s captivity. H.—He still dates from the transmigration of Joachin. C. 1. &c. W.—Some think he speaks of the first, fourth, or fifth month. Tyre was not besieged till after the ninth day of the fourth month, when Jerusalem was taken; nor could she express her joy for that event before, unless God allude to her dispositions, &c. C. 25:1. C.  
**2** *Gates:* places of resort and commerce. The Jews came to Jerusalem frequently from all parts, which increased her beauty and trade. New Tyre expects that more will come to her.  
**3** *Up.* Nabuchodonosor besieged the city for thirteen years. The profane historians read by S. Jerom took no notice of this; but Josephus quotes several. An. x. 11. and c. Ap. i. C.  
**4** *Dust.* She shall be demolished, and the rubbish thrown into the sea, to make a road by which New Tyre in the island might be attacked. v. 12. H.  
**5** *Sea.* S. Jerom explains this of New Tyre; Marsham of the Old. To reconcile the different texts, we only need to suppose that both cities were connected by a road thrown up in the sea by Hiram, and repaired by Nabuchodonosor with great labour, (C. 29:18) after it had been destroyed by the inhabitants of New Tyre, when they saw the old city on the continent fall a prey. S. Jer. C.  
**7** *Kings:* Nabuchodonosor (4 K. 25:28) or Alexander, who took Tyre. M.  
**8** *Daughters.* Many towns were subject to Tyre: almost all Phœnicia acknowledged her dominion, as well as ( C.) the seas to which her fleets went. v. 15. Selden. Mare i. 6. Curt. iv.—These smaller cities shall fall, and the town shall be of no service except to dry nets. W.  
**9** *Engines.* Lit. “vine.” H.—A covert was thus made for the soldiers, (Veget. iv. 15.) when they approached the walls. M.  
**10** *Destroyed.* Old Tyre was taken by storm. It is doubtful whether it was pillaged. C. 29:18. C.  
**11** *Statues.* The citizens chained the golden statue of Apollo to the altar of Hercules, for fear of its leaving them, when Alexander attacked the town. Curt. iv.—Hiram placed a pillar of gold in the temple of Hercules. Jos. C. Ap. i.—Herodotus (ii. 44.) saw another also of emerald stone, (σμαραγδον) which illuminated the temple in the night. On such the Tyrian might depend; though some render, “the substance *or* guard of thy strength,” denoting the soldiers ( C.) and towers. H.—The gods were treated like the people, and their precious ornaments plundered.  
**14** *More*, for seventy years. Is. 23:15. The people returned at the same time as the Jews. A. 3468. Soon after, Zacharias (C. 9) speaks of Tyre as then subsisting. It was very strong in Alexander’s time, (who took it with difficulty, as Antigonus did eighteen years later) and had a very extensive commerce when S. Jerom wrote. But all this must be understood of New Tyre. The old city never regained much splendour. C.—It is still in ruins. A modern traveller was struck with the completion of this prophecy, beholding a few miserable fishermen drying their *nets* on the spot!  
**16** *Sea:* colonies, or tributary to Tyre. v. 8. H.—Leptis, Utica, Carthage, and Cadiz, were founded by Tyrians. Pliny v. 19.—Some pretend that these cities were attacked by the conquerors, for manifesting their grief. See Jos. Ant. x. Pineda, &c.—But we shall not here follow conjectures.—*Astonishment.* Heb. “troubles,” or mourning. C.  
**17** *Dwellest in.* Heb. “of the seas.” Prot. “seafaring men,” ( H.) being near the sea, or thence deriving thy riches.  
**18** *Because.* Heb. “at thy departure.” C.—Sept. “into captivity.” S. Jer.  
**19** *Waters;* great armies, (v. 3) or when thou art in the regions below. Job 26:5. C.—Tyre was humbled for her pride, but restored after seventy years. Is. 23. Our Saviour retired into those parts. Mat. 15:21. W.  
**20** *Everlasting:* in the grave, till the day of judgment. Ps. 48:12. Wisd. 12:5.—*Living*, assigned to Israel, (C. 32:24. C.) where holy people adore the true God, and shall rise to life eternal. M.  
**21** *For ever:* for a long time, (Theod.) not at all in thy ancient glory. H.—The city subsisted after the days of Nabuchodonosor and of Alexander. C. v. 14.—But the ancient city was reduced to a mere nothing. H.

**3** *Entry*, whence merchants may proceed from an excellent harbour to any place.  
**4** *Neighbours* of Sidon. Jos. 19:29. C.—Sept. “thy children.” Prot. “thy builders.” H.—The description of the Tyrian grandeur, shews their more woeful ruin. W.  
**5** *Thee.* Heb. “all thy *ship*-boards.” Sept. Prot. H.—S. Jerom has divided ( C.) leuthim, “decks of the sea,” as yam denotes the sea. H.  
**6** *Benches.* Sept. “temples.”—*Italy.* Heb. Cetim. Macedonia. Boch. C.—All distant places were styled islands, ( H.) when they went by water to them.  
**7** *Linen.* Cotton, (Ex. 25:4) used for standards. Sept. “for bed coverlets,” or for sails.—*Mast.* Cleopatra and Caligula were still more sumptuous in their sails.—*Elisa*, or Elis, famous for purple: yet Tyre was more so.  
**8** Aradians. Sidon and Arad were then subject to Tyre, and supplied rowers.—*Pilots.* They studied no other science.  
**9** Gebal. Sept. “Biblos,” which is the same. 3 K. 5:18.—*Furnished.* Heb. “were in thee to repair thy breaches.” Sept. “strengthened thy designs.”  
**10** Lybians. Heb. “Phut.” They had been expelled by the Cyreneans. Tyre had in her pay the most warlike nations of Persia, &c. Cyrus soon after shook off the yoke of the Medes, and conquered the Lydians.—*Hung up.* v. 11. This was very usual. Cant. 4:4. Is. 22:8. C.  
**11** *The Pygmean* *s.* That is, strong and valiant men. In Heb. Gammadim. Ch.—He does not speak of those fabulous men hardly a cubit high. Gomed signifying a “cubit,” has caused them to be styled so here. Sept. “guards;” or Sym. “Medes.” Ezechiel (38:6) speaks of the Gomerim.  
**12** *Carthaginians.* Heb. “Tharsis,” in Cilicia; (Gen. 10:4. C.) or distant merchants, who came by *sea.* H.  
**13** *Slaves.* Those from Greece were much esteemed. C.—Alas! thirty thousand Tyrians were themselves thus sold by Alexander! H.  
**14** *Horses.* Those of Sarmatia ( C.) were in high repute. Pliny viii. 42.  
**15** *Dedan.* Sept. “Rhodians;” or rather Arabs are meant. v. 20. They might receive ivory from Ethiopia.—*Teeth.* Heb. “horns *or* tusks,” which the elephant casts every year. The ivory is less brittle. 3 K. 10:18. C.—*Ebony;* a hard black wood, like horn. Bochart.  
**16** *Syrian:* always much addicted to commerce. S. Jer.—Sept. read *Adam* for *Aram*, as if the traffic in *men* was meant: ( C.) “ivory, and to those who brought, thou gavest thy rewards. (16) Men of thy traffic,” &c. H.—*Linen.* Heb. buts, “silk” extracted from the *pinna* fish. 1 Par. 15:27. *Silk.* Heb. ramoth, may rather denote unicorns. Job 28:18. C.—*Chodchod* *.* It is the Hebrew name for some precious stone, but of what kind in particular, interpreters are not agreed. Ch.—Some say the carbuncle, &c. S. Jerom renders it *the jasper.* Is. 54:12. W.—Here he confesses he knows not the meaning. C.  
**17** *Rosin.* Our version generally renders this, *balm.* H.—It was much used to heal. Jer. 8:22. Gen. 37:25.  
**18** *Rich.* Heb. Chelbon; perhaps the city Chelba. Jud. 1:31. The kings of Persia used this wine, and planted vines at Damascus on purpose.  
**19** *Dan:* the citizens of Peneas, the tribe of Dan was in captivity. Grotius places these nations in Zeilan, ( C.) or Ceylon. H.  
**20** *Seats*, such as the Turks still use, or to throw over horses instead of saddles.  
**23** *Haran*, or *Charæ*, famous for the residence of Abraham and the defeat of Crassus.—*Eden*, the province where Paradise was situated.  
**24** *Cords*, in boxes, which had then no locks.  
**25** *Sea.* Heb. Tharsis, in Cilicia; or large, and fit for long voyages. Thine were the best. C.  
**26** *South.* Heb. kodim, ( H.) “eastern,” or rather “burning,” here means Nabuchodonosor, who came from the north, (C. 26:7. C.) or east. The fall of Tyre is described as a shipwreck. H.  
**30** *Ashes.* They followed the same customs as the Jews. C.—The latter were ordered to avoid cutting the hair, like them; yet did so. Deut. 14. Is. 22:22. W.

## Chapter 28

**2** *Prince.* The Jews say Hiram, (S. Jer.) supposing that he lived a thousand years; though this is not requisite, as he died only four hundred and thirty years before. The idea is childish. The king who was taken and slain, at this siege, was probably ( C.) Ithobalos. Jos. Ant. x. 11.—Origen applies this to the angel guardian of Tyre. S. Aug. thinks an allusion is made to the fall of Lucifer. But it may all refer to the king, ( C.) though others explain part of him and the rest of the devil. S. Jer. E.  
**3** *Than Daniel;* viz. in thy own conceit. The wisdom of Daniel was so much celebrated in his days, that it became a proverb among the Chaldees, when any one would express an extraordinary wisdom, to say he was *as wise as Daniel.* Ch. W.—He was now at court, and had explained the dream of Nabuchodonosor. Dan. 2:27.  
**10** *Uncircumcised.* The Jews deemed this a disgrace. 1 K. 31:4. The king would be exposed to eternal death, being devoid of faith, &c. C.  
**12** *Resembla* *nce.* The king of Tyre, by his dignity and his natural perfections, bore in himself a certain resemblance to God, by reason of which he might be called *the seal of resemblance*, &c. But what is here said to him is commonly understood of Lucifer, the king over all the children of pride. Ch.—A seal is perfect when it represents things exactly. The prophet speaks ironically, to repress the king’s vanity.  
**13** *Paradise.* Thou hadst every thing delightful at Tyre. C.—*Covering.* Heb. “bandage;” diadem, ( H.) or belt. Sept. specify twelve stones. See Ex. 28:17.—*Pipes;* music used at the coronation, which was celebrated as a birth-day. C.—God give and withdraws power from all kings. As long as they act well, they are a sort of sanctuary. H.  
**14** *Stretched out.* That is, thy wings extended. This alludes to the figure of the cherubims in the sanctuary, which with *stretched out* wings covered the ark, ( Ch.) on *the holy mountain.* S. Jer. &c.—*Fire.* That is, bright and precious stones, which sparkle like fire. Ch.—With these the king’s robes glittered, or he walked upon them. Est. 1:6. C.—*Calcacabatur onyx* *.* Lucan x.  
**15** *Iniquity.* Tyre was before wicked; but when the king pretended to be a god, (v. 2) it could no longer be endured. W.  
**17** *Beauty.* Riches have corrupted thy heart.  
**18** *Sanctuaries*, or temples, which was a crime ( C.) in an idolater, as he took them to be the temples of a real deity. H.  
**22** *Sidon.* It gave rise to Tyre, yet was now inferior, though independent of it, (Is. 23:4) or subject to Egypt. Diod. ii. 2.—It was now pillaged.  
**24** *Bitterness.* Jezabel came hence; (3 K. 16:31) and the Phœnicians hemmed in the Israelites as much as possible, and fought against them. C.—Sidon was near Tyre, and imitating her crimes was also punished.  
**25** *When.* All shall praise God, seeing that he receives his people again after he has justly chastised them. W.

## Chapter 29

**1** *Eleventh.* Heb. “twelfth.” Sept. “first of the twelfth month of the twelfth year.” There are other variations in the versions. S. Jerom reads the first in Heb. as Theodoret does, who says that it and the Syr. have the twelfth year: which is true, if we neglect the points. C.—The prophets do not observe the order of times. What is here delivered, was sooner fulfilled; or Tyre and Sodom lay nearer than Egypt. W.—The three next chapters regard that country.  
**2** *Pharao*, Ephree. Jer. 44:30. He came to assist Sedecias; but the Chaldeans raised the siege, went to meet him, an defeated his army. After they had subdued the neighbouring nations, Tyre, &c. they fell upon Egypt. A. 3433. C.  
**3** *Dragon.* Heb. tannin, ( H.) whence *thunnus* may be derived, means any water monster, and seems here put for the *crocodile*, ( C.) which Pharao signifies. Grot.—It was the symbol of Egypt, ( C.) and adored by the people. Juv. 15:2.—*Rivers;* the different branches of the Nile, and the canals.—*Myself.* I owe my power to no other. C.—“Apries is said to think that no god could deprive him of the kingdom, so well he seemed to have established it.” Herod. ii. 169.—So the ancient Pharao said; I know not the Lord. Ex. 5:2. He boasts of having conducted the waters of the Nile through the land. v. 9. M.—This river was honoured as the greatest of the gods. Heliod. 9.—  
**4** *Bridle.* The Tentyrians jump upon the crocodile’s back, give it a club to bite at, which they seize with both hands, and bring it to the shore. Pliny viii. 25.—Others throw a hook baited with swine’s flesh, and holding the rope on the shore, make a little pig squeak, with draws the attention of the crocodile; and, as it comes for its prey, it swallows the hook, and its eyes being filled with dust is easily slain. Herod. ii. 70.—Apries sent an army against Cyrene, which being defeated as it was thought by the king’s fault, many of the Egyptians revolted. He sent Amasis to reduce them, but they gave him the crown. Herod. ii. 161. and iv. 159.—Nabuchodonsor taking advantage of these disturbances, and perhaps invited by Amasis, entered Egypt, drove Apries into Higher Egypt, slew many of the inhabitants, and Jews, &c. and left Amasis to govern the wretched remains of the kingdom. Usher, A. 3430. The Scripture, however, seems to say that Pharao was slain; (Jer. 43. &c. C.) which Ctesias assures us was done by Amasis, though Herodotus (ii. 169.) says he was killed by the people, and buried with his fathers. This latter circumstance is not very probable: but the historian followed the account of the priests, who would mention what was most honourable for the nation. He seems to have been left unburied. v. 5. *Scales.* The people depended on the king and share his fate. C.  
**6** *Israel*, tempting them to rebel. S. Jer.—He promised more than he was able or strove to perform, though he made a show of giving aid.  
**7** *Loins.* They fell upon thee, and thou didst wound ( C.) or “dissolve” their loins. H.  
**10** *Tower;* or rather ( C.) Heb. and Sept. “from Magdol to Syene.” H.—This was on the frontiers of *Ethiopia*, below the cataracts. Pliny v. 9.  
**11** *Years*, till the third of Cyrus, who gave liberty to all the captives at the beginning of his reign. v. 13. C.—Amasis reigned forty-four years in Lower Egypt, (Herod. iii. 10.) over the few whom Nabuchodonosor spared.  
**14** *Low.* The Jews were not more tempted to apply to them for aid. C.—Amasis strove to shake off the yoke: but Cambyses came and slew many. Psammenites killed himself; (Herod. iii. 9.) or was taken to Susa, and the country laid waste. Ctesias—Egypt has almost ever since been subject to foreign princes, ( H.) Persians, Greeks, Romans, Saracens, Mamelukes, and Turks. The trade of Egypt, by caravans, was in a manner destroyed for forty years by Nabuchodonosor, whose victories Megesthenes and Berosus attest 300 years before Christ. Watson.  
**17** *Year:* fifteen ( C.) or seventeen years after the preceding prophecy, (v. 1. W.) but on the same subject.  
**18** *Peeled*, with carrying machines of war and burdens for thirteen years.—*No reward* worth the labour. The new city surrendered upon terms, ( C.) or the citizens shipped off their most valuable goods, and retired to Carthage, &c. God gives a temporal reward for moral virtues, (S. Jer.) even to infidels. W.—Thus he rewarded the ancient Romans, and the midwives. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. v. 12. and S. Tho. i. 2. q. 114. a. 10.—They had no intention of pleasing God, ( C.) or of directing their labours for his service. H.  
**21** *Horn:* Zorobabel; (S. Jer.) Jechonias, who was honoured by Evil-merodac; ( T.) or Daniel and Mardochai, with all the nation.—*Month.* Thou shalt speak boldly, and they will give credit to thee henceforward. C.

## Chapter 30

**2** *Day* of vengeance, ( C.) when the Lord shall judge, (1 Cor. 5:2) and Egypt shall fall a prey to the most powerful nation of the Chaldees. W.  
**4** *Ethiopia.* Heb. “Chus,” denoting part of Arabia, or rather Ethiopia.  
**5** *Lydia.* Heb. “Phut,” near Egypt. C.—These troops were paid. H.—*Chub*, in Mareotis.—*Covenant:* the Jews or auxiliaries. Sept. add, “the Persians and Cretans.” C.—There were Persians in Africa who followed Hercules. Pliny v. 8.  
**9** *Messengers;* the Chaldeans. C.—The Nile was navigable as far as Syene. S. Jer.  
**12** *Dry.* The canals were obstructed ( C.) which rendered cavalry useless. Herod. ii. 108.  
**13** *Memphis*, the capital of Lower Egypt, ( C.) where the idol or bull ( H.) Apis was fed. C.—Here Amasis overcame Apries. Herod. ii. 168.—The Chaldees made war on the gods as well as on the people.—*Prince* Amasis was tributary to Babylon. Some of this probably regards the times of Cambyses and Ochus. Usher, A. 3478 and 3653. C. See C. 29:14. H.  
**14** *Taphnis*, or Tanis, famous for the miracles of Moses. C.—*Alexandria.* In the Heb. *No*, which was the ancient name of that city, which was afterwards rebuilt by Alexander the Great, and from his name called Alexandria. Ch.—Sept. “Memphis or Diospolis;” ( C.) or Thebes, capital of Higher Egypt; (Boch.) though it seems rather a maritime town. Nah. 3:8. C.  
**15** *Pelusium* *.* Heb. Sin, ( H.) “muddy,” has the same import as πηλος. C.—The place is now called Damietta. H.  
**18** *Darkened:* war and misery shall ensue.—*Sceptres*, by dethroning Apries.—*Pride;* overflowing of the Nile. See Jer. 49:19.  
**20** *Year*, in which Jerusalem was taken. Pharao lost a battle. His country was afterwards invaded, ( C.) and his subjects rebelled. v. 21. H.—Part of the kingdom had been already subdued. 4 K. 24:7. W.

## Chapter 31

**1** *Year*, about a month before the fall of Jerusalem.  
**3** *Assyrian.* The ruin of this great empire ( C.) might have admonished the king of Egypt of his frail condition. H.—About thirty-eight years before ( C.) Ninive had been taken, and its king (Sarac or Chinaladan) slain by his own general, Nabopolassar, and by Astyages, of Media. They divided the empire between them, and the father of Nabuchodonosor fixed his residence at Babylon. Usher, A. 3378.—*Cedar.* Sept. “cypress.”—*Top;* the king of Ninive. C.—Egypt’s monarch thought himself invincible; yet would fall like the Assyrians. W.  
**4** *Roots.* Various nations paid tribute to the Assyrians, (S. Jer. C.) while he sent his troops, like *rivulets*, to keep all in subjection. Theod.  
**11** *I have delivered.* Here the time past is put for the future; i.e. *I shall deliver.*—*The mighty one*, &c. viz. Nabuchodonosor, who conquered both the Assyrians and Egyptians; ( Ch.) or rather his father, Nabopolassar, subdued the former. v. 3. H.  
**12** *Strangers;* revolted Assyrians. See Ps. 17:46.  
**13** *Branches.* The nations continued, but submitted to another master.  
**14** *Pit.* The new king would appoint fresh governors.  
**15** **5** **.** *Waters*, as if they bewailed his fate. C.—Those whom the king of Ninive had exalted, and the people, who wished not to submit to a foreigner, would no doubt lament the slaughtered monarch, new silent ( H.) in the grave. Theod.  
**16** *Comforted.* The ghosts of princes who had been subject to Serac, seeing his fall, bore their own misfortune with greater content. In the grave there is no distinction of master and slave. C.—Surviving princes expected some emolument from the change. H.  
**17** *Arm;* those in power. Sept. “his seed.” Heb. Zora, ( H.) means both.  
**18** *Famous* king of Assyria, or of Egypt.—*Pharao* *.* C.—

## Chapter 32

**1** *Twelfth.* He counts from the captivity of Jechonias, as Sedecias reigned only eleven years. W.  
**2** *Dragon*, or crocodile; two of the most terrible creatures.—*With the horn* is not expressed in Heb. and the crocodile has nothing like a horn. It has four feet, with which it makes the water muddy. C.  
**3** *Net.* Sept. “hook.” C. 29:4. C.—Some take the crocodile with a *net.* v. 3. Elian. Hist. x. 21.  
**5** *Corruption.* Sept. “blood.” But romuth ( H.) means rather “worms.” Syr. C.  
**7** **Ver.** **7–8** **.** *Out*, like a candle, by death; *extinctus* *.* H.—The glory of Egypt was so great, that at its fall the light of heaven seemed diminished. W.—Great desolation is thus intimated.—*When*, &c. is not is some Latin copies, nor in Heb. &c. C.  
**9** *Anger*, as they will not know why I have treated thee so severely: or rather, they shall be afraid for themselves. v. 10. C.  
**12** *Invincible*, when they wield God’s sword. Cyrus easily conquered them. H.—Heb. “strong,.” Sept. “pestiferous.”  
**14** *Oil.* It is very transparent. It seems the Nile was rendered muddy by cattle, &c.  
**15** *Fulness*, or all of it shall be desolate.  
**17** *Month:* probably the twelfth. v. 1.  
**18** *Down:* announce this catastrophe. C.—Apries was slain by order of Amasis. Diodor. 1. Jer. 44:30.  
**21** *Most.* Sept. “giants shall say to thee: Remain in the depth of the pit. Whom dost thou excel? descend,” &c. H.—They vary much in this chapter from the Heb. S. Jer.—*Helpers;* Lybians, &c. C. 30:5. These shall come to compliment the king. C.—After a battle, those of the same nation were buried together. v. 22. Theod.—The Egyptians had tombs like houses, in which there were separate holes or apartments ( C.) as in large vaults. H.  
**24** *Shame.* They are buried without any distinction.  
**27** *Not.* Some copies of Sept. omit the negation. Others render the Heb. “Have they not slept?” &c. These nations were deprived of military honours, dying like cowards; and therefore their swords were not placed with them in the grave. C.—It was customary to inter such things as the deceased had like the most. Serv. in Æn. x. *Arma quibus lætatus habe tus*, &c. Simon (1 Mac. 13:29) placed arms and representations of ships on the pillars at Modin, in honour of his kindred. If Elam, &c. had not received such distinction, why should the Egyptian repine? Were they any better? C.—The country and king of the Elamites, Assyrians, and other infidels, shall be destroyed. W.  
**28** *Midst.* This threat would make great impression on the Egyptians, who were particularly solicitous to be buried with their fathers.  
**29** Edom*.* Sept. add, “and all the Assyrian princes.” Some copies omit Edom. H.—This nation had laid aside circumcision, which Hircan forced them to resume. They had been present at the siege of Jerusalem. C. 35. C.  
**30** *Hunters* of men, like Nimrod, the first king of Assyria. H.  
**32** *My.* Heb. Sept. “his,” ( C.) alluding to the ravages of Nechao; (Grot.) though the Hebrew may also signify *my*, as the Jews read Egypt, and Palestine, the *land of the living*, were filled with *terror.* After the latter had been chastised, Pharao might dread ( C.) a worse fate; ( H.) and the multitudes slain before him, might afford him some ( C.) wretched consolation. H.—It is evident that those nations believed the existence of separate spirits, and had not given in to the errors of the Sadducees, or of the Metempsychosis. C.

## Chapter 33

**2** *Take.* Before (C. 3:17.) God made the choice, ( C.) as he does here, v. 7. He confirms the authority of those who are appointed to govern.—*Meanest.* Lit. “last,” ( H.) which seems to denote such as are chosen without regard to their dignity or obscurity in life. Gen. 47:2 and 3 K. 12:31. C.—Pastors are not excused from admonishing the people for fear of danger or despair of reclaiming them, as each one is bound to do his duty. S. Jer. W.  
**6** *Iniquity*, not regarding the admonitions of his pastor; (C. 3:18. C.) or rather of conscience, when the guide proves faithless and silent, as in this instance. H.—The people were persuaded that none suffered except for some fault. v. 10. Jer. 31:30. Dan. 13:52. Gen. 44:16. The author of the Book of Job takes great pains to remove this mistake. God sometimes sends crosses for a trial, ( C.) and to increase the merit of his servants; though it be very true, ( H.) “no one is miserable except he deserve it.” S. Aug.  
**8** *Surely die* a temporal, (Theod.) or rather an eternal death. S. Jer.  
**10** *Live?* They suppose their case to be desperate, as their fathers had sinned. C. 18. The prophet shews that none are punished except for their own faults, ( C.) and that “each one has free-will to be saved or to be lost.” S. Jer.  
**11** *Desire.* The sinner’s damnation is not an object of God’s pleasure. C. 18:23. C.—He has an antecedent will to save all. He knocks at the door of our heart, (Apoc. 3:20) and if man do what depends on him, nothing will be wanting on the part of God. S. Tho. i. 2. q. 109. and 112. W.  
**12** *Hurt him* *.* God effaces all past crimes: yet a relapse makes them as it were revive, and is pardoned with more difficulty. Mat. 18:35. Some read, “In what day the converted sinner groans, he shall be saved,” as if they had taken in part of Is. 30:15.  
**17** *Equitable;* as we are much more inclined to vice than to virtue. This argumentation is inconclusive, as God owes nothing to man; and what good the latter does, is an effect of His grace. The propensity to evil is no excuse, as man is still free. He is judged according to the dispositions in which he is found at the hour of death; yet we must not infer, that those who have spent their lives in sinning will be no worse treated than the person who dies guilty of a single crime.  
**21** *Twelfth.* Rom. Sept. “tenth.” Syr. “eleventh year, … in the twelfth month;” which Theodoret thinks more probable, as the city was taken in the ninth of the fourth month of that year. Yet even so, it is strange that the news should not arrive before. Some think ( C.) that the messenger came also to announce what happened after the death of Godolias. Sanct.—*Captivity.* Here it is evident that the prophet dates from that event. C. 1. &c. H.—As he prophesied on the very day when the city was besieged, (C. 24:2) so (v. 26) he foretold that one should come three years after to inform him of the capture. W.—Then the people would believe him, (ib. v. 27. C.) and he would open his *mouth* boldly. v. 22. H.  
**24** *Places.* He has answered those who despaired. v. 10. Now he turns to the presumptuous, who expected to be treated like Abraham, though they did not imitate his virtues. C.—They perhaps entertained these sentiments before the death of Godolias, thinking to establish themselves *in the land.* Afterwards the prophet Jeremias could not prevail on them to remain, though God promised them security.  
**25** *To them.* Grabe marks to v. 27. *Thus saith*, &c. as wanting in the Sept. though not in the Alex. copy. S. Jerom reckons eight verses or lines omitted. H.—The Comp. and Theodoret read them with some variations.—*The blood.* It must be carefully extracted. Gen. 9:4. Lev. 7:26.—*Uncleannesses;* idols, in which you trust.  
**26** *Swords*, thinking to live thereby, (Gen. 27:40) and to be secure. But I will disarm you. The *pestilence* shall find out those in the rocks. v. 27.  
**30** *Walls*, the resort of idle people. C.  
**31** *In* to a religious meeting. Chal. Perhaps they came on the sabbath to his house. Yet they made a just and *song* of his instructions. C.—They heard them with pleasure, but did not reform their lives. H.  
**33** *Coming.* The desolation of Jerusalem, ( H.) and what I have foretold, hath already taken place; or, the news will presently arrive: as it did the following morning. v. 21. C.

## Chapter 34

**2** *Shepherds.* That is, princes, magistrates, chief priests, and scribes. Ch.—Shepherds may lawfully take milk, (1 Cor. 9:7) but the sheep and its wool belong to the master. W.—Excellent instructions are here given for all in authority. C.  
**3** *Fat.* Pastors often disguise the truth to flatter the rich, or the more just souls are ruined by their negligence.  
**4** *Healed.* God alone can restore to life. But pastors will not be excused by ignorance if they know not the maladies and the remedies of their flock.—*Hand.* This was blamed in the Pharisees, and is contrary to the spirit of the gospel. Mat. 23:4. 1 Pet. 5:2.  
**5** *Field.* The people being neglected, followed false prophets and idols. Their teachers were so far from striving to reclaim them, that they perhaps shewed them the example. C.  
**8** *No shepherd.* Pastors who seek only their temporal advantage, (1 Tim. 6:5. Tit. 1:7. H.) are hirelings; and if they teach false doctrine, they are wolves. John 10. W.  
**10** **Ver** **.** **10** **.** *Cease.* Both the leaders and the people were led into captivity.  
**12** *Day*, in persecution. I will count my sheep, lest any be lost.  
**13** *Land.* All this cannot be understood of the synagogue alone.  
**16** *Preserve*, (Sept. Syr.) which seems more natural than Heb. and Chal. “destroy.” I will not eat them, like bad shepherds. v. 3. C.—God and those whom he sends, will take care of the flock. Eph. 4. W.  
**17** *Cattle.* The crimes of the pastors do not excuse the flock. In it there are people of different dispositions. The rich often destroy, and these are brought to an account. v. 24. C.  
**23** *David;* Christ, who is of the house of David. C.—That king had been dead long before, so that no Jew or heretic can deny but that the Messias is here meant, as C. 37:24. &c. W.—He possessed eminently all the virtues of David, and was of his seed. Zorobabel, &c. cannot be understood, as we have no proof that the governors after the captivity were chosen from the tribe of Juda. C. 21:27.  
**25** *Peace.* Christ pacifies all. Rom. 15:33. Mic. 5:5. Eph. 6:15.—*Beasts:* those who promote idolatry; or, speaking of Christians, who teach heretical doctrine and persecute the Church. C.  
**26** *Make.* Lit. “place.” H.—Sept. read not *a blessing*, which seems superfluous. C.—Yet Chal. has it, and the idea is more complete. H.  
**29** *A bud of renown*, (*germen nominatum* *.*) He speaks of Christ, our Lord, the illustrious bud of the house of David, renowned over all the earth. See Jer. 33:15. Ch.—Sept. Syr. “a plant of peace.” Chal. “established.” C.  
**31** *Men.* What has been said of sheep ( M.) relates to you.—*Am the Lord.* This is not in Heb. or Prot. H.—But it is found in one Heb. MS. and Sept. as this version is thus frequently confirmed. Kennicott, Dis. ii.

## Chapter 35

**2** *Face.* Address, or speak without fearing any man. W.—*Seir:* Idumea. He speaks of its devastation, both by Nabuchodonosor on the side of Moab, and by the Machabees in what remained. Jer. 27:7 and 1 Mac. 4:60 and 14:33. C.  
**5** *Enemy.* God revenges the injuries done to his Church, as if they were done to himself. Acts 9:4. W.—The enmity of Jacob and of Esau seemed to commence in the womb, and was increased by the purchase of the birth-right, till Jacob’s prudence disarmed his brother. Their descendants sought every opportunity to injure one another. The Idumeans shewed their ill-will particularly, when the Jews were most distressed. This was a piece of the greatest cruelty.  
**6** *Blood.* The Machabees sprung from the same stock. Pursue the Idumeans, and force them to receive circumcision. 1 Mac. 4:15.  
**9** *Inhabited* for a considerable time, as C. 26:20.  
**10** *Two.* I will add the country of the Jews to my own, or will possess the land belonging to the kingdoms of Juda and of Israel. Their hopes were blasted. They never occupied any thing belonging to the Israelites, and what they had taken from Juda, as far as Hebron, was recovered.—*There*, witness of these designs, and guardian of his temple, &c.  
**11** *Wrath.* The Jews shall treat you as you have threatened to do unto them.—*By them*, my people. Sept. “to thee.”  
**13** *Derogated.* Sept. “bawled;” or Heb. “multiplied your words against me,” as if I could not protect my inheritance. H.—You would pretend to judge me, and to fathom my designs.  
**14** *Rejoice.* After the captivity, the Machabees shall conquer Edom.  
**15** *As*, &c. is not in the Rom. Sept. S. Jerom says it was marked with an asterisk, being taken from Theodotion. C.—Grabe supplies to *thou shalt.* His copy has the rest: … “thou shalt know that I am their Lord.” H.  

---

## Chapter 36

**1** *Israel.* The restoration of the Jews and the redemption of Christ, constitute this fourth division. W.—Edom has seized parts of the country, as if I had abandoned my people for ever.  
**2** *Heights.* Sept. “deserts.” The mountains are often styled eternal, as being the best symbols of durability. Deut. 33:15.  
**3** *Reproach.* This God had repeatedly threatened. Deut. 28:37. C. Jer. 24:9.—People talked of their distress. W.  
**8** *Israel.* Some apply what follows to the captives returning; others, perceiving that the expressions were not then literally verified, have recourse to the reign of 1000 years. Others again explain the whole of Christ’s Church. But some expressions refer to it, and others to the captives; which, though mixed together, induce no confusion, as what belongs to the Jews was a figure of what regarded Christ; and the predictions of the Messias might be applied to the Jews in a hyperbolical sense. S. Aug. Doct. iii. 34. S. Jer. M. T. C.  
**11** *Gr* *eater.* Sept. “similar.” H.—It would be difficult to shew that the Jews arrived at greater eminence after the captivity than before, ( C.) though they were less addicted to idolatry. Their kingdom was not independent: they had no prophets, &c. But the superior numbers and excellence of the Christian Church is manifest.  
**12** *Them.* Antiochus and the Romans laid waste the country; ( C.) and Adrian would not allow the Jews to come near Jerusalem. S. Jer. Eus. iv. 6.—The people were not indeed removed together, as they had been. But all this is verified only in the Church, which in the midst of persecutions always subsists. Theodoret thinks these promises were conditional with respect to the Jews.  
**13** *Men.* This remark was very ancient. Num. 13:33. Wars had almost always raged in the country. C.  
**15** *More.* This whole promise principally relates to the Church of Christ, and God’s perpetual protection of her; for to the carnal Jews, they have been removed out of their land these sixteen hundred years. Ch.  
**18** *Blood* of their own children, and of the innocent. C. 16:36 and 22:2 and 33:25.  
**20** *Land.* Yet their conduct was no better than that of infidels. Thus they throw the blame on the law, and upon God himself. Jer. 48:9. &c. C.—The Jews had provoked God to punish them with captivity; and hence the nations took occasion to blaspheme, that he could not protect them.  
**22** *Holy*, that my attributes of justice and mercy may be confessed. Is. 48:2. Dan. 3:49. Judith 8:24.  
**25** *Water.* R. David and the Chal. explain this of the remission of sin; and all Christians understand it of baptism in water, remitting all offences. Eph. 5:26. Tit. 3:5. W.—He alludes to the purification of the Jews, which prefigured baptism and penance, in which the blood of Christ is applied to our souls. This of course was only fulfilled in his church.  
**26** *Flesh.* The Jews at their return fell not so often into the sins of idolatry, &c. of which the prophets complained. But yet they were far from answering this character. Great irregularities prevailed under Nehemias, and in the days of the Machabees the priests publicly worshipped idols. 1 Esd. 9. and 2 Esd. 5. and 8 and 2 Mac. 4 and 5. Christ enables his servants to act with purity unto the end, by the influence of his all-powerful grace. C.  
**27** *Do them.* Hence the efficacy of grace appears, (S. Aug. H.) and hereby some keep the commandments. W.—God assists our free-will. Theod. A.Lap. C.  
**37** *Find.* Heb. “seek.” I will cause great multitudes to come to the solemn feast. This was seen still more after the conversion of the Gentiles. C.

## Chapter 37

**1** *Spirit*, by a divine impulse. He was not really removed. M. C.—*Bones.* “This passage is very famous.” S. Jer.—It insinuates the liberation of the captives and of the Gentiles, as well as the mystery of the resurrection. W.—If this were not to take place, it would not be adduced as a figure. Tert. S. Jer.  
**5** *Spirit.* That is, life, soul, and breath. Ch.—At the resurrection, the same souls shall return to their respective bodies.  
**7** *Noise* of the bones moving, which denotes the wars of Cyrus and the hurry of the nations to which he restored liberty.  
**9** *Spirit;* wind or soul. The latter animates the body, as the grace ( C.) of the Holy Spirit does the soul. H.  
**11** *Off*, like branches. Notwithstanding these desponding thoughts, God will restore his people, ( W.) by means of Cyrus. The grave is often put for punishment and grievous calamities. Osee 6:3.  
**16** *Associates.* When Jeroboam caused the division, some of *Israel* adhered to Juda. The prophet glued the pieces of wood together, or engrafted them one into the other, to shew that all the people should be united, and the Jews and Gentiles concur to form one church. C. Rom. 11:17.—Before the latter event took place God united the two kingdoms, to teach us that when we labour for the conversion of heretics, as in England, Catholics must first agree among themselves, that so all may more easily become *one fold* under *one shepherd.* W.  
**22** *King.* The Jews were long without kings, after the captivity; then they were not of the tribe of Juda, and all did not return. Christ fulfils the prediction.  
**23** *Idols.* The Jews, even many of the priests, worshipped them, under Antiochus. C.—But the Church is never defiled. H.  
**24** *David;* Christ, the *one shepherd*, (Jo. 10) over all nations. W.—This cannot refer to Zorobabel, who was never king, nor perhaps even governor; as Sasabasar, who seems to have been a Persian, was appointed by Cyrus. 1 Esd. 1:8.—*Shepherd.* David have been one. C.—This title is more modest than that of king. S. Jer.  
**25** *Ever.* Let the Jews shew how this had been accomplished. We know that Christ preserves and rule his Church unto the end.  
**26** *Peace.* Can this regard the synagogue? Not a century passed without some flagrant misconduct, or chastisement. But our Saviour is the mediator of peace. Phil. 4:7. C.

## Chapter 38

**2** *Gog.* This name, which signifies *hidden*, or *covered*, is taken in this place either for the persecutors of the Church of God in general, or some arch persecutor in particular; such as Antichrist shall be in the latter days. See Apoc. 20:8. And what is said of the punishment of God, is verified by the unhappy end of persecutors.—*Magog.* Scythia or Tartary, whence the Turks and other enemies of the Church of Christ originally sprung. Ch.—These are supposed to be the princes of some northern and barbarous country, ( W.) peopled by the son of Japhet. S. Jer.—S. Aug. (de Civ. Dei. xx. 11.) observes, that as the Church is spread everywhere, so also are persecutors. But Christ will overcome them all. W.—This prophecy is very difficult. It seems literally to refer to Cambyses, who invaded Judea about seventy years after the temple had been destroyed, and perished by the hand of God, at Ecbatana, upon Mount Carmel. It is very usual with the prophets to give fictitious names; as the king of Tyre is called a *cherub*, and Jerusalem *Ooliba* *.* Cambyses ruled over Scythia, in Iberia; styled Gogarene, by Strabo. xi. C.—The proper Scythia withstood all the attempts of his successors, and defeated Darius. H.  
**4** *Jaws.* Thus Cambyses treated the son of Psammenites. God has the most absolute dominion over all monarchs. v. 7.  
**8** *Visited*, or rather “shall visit” Judea. Chal. Grot.—Cambyses invaded Egypt twelve years after the Jews had returned, and came upon them two years later, designing to plunder them, at the instigation of their malevolent neighbours. He had sustained great losses in Egypt, and was arrived at Carmel when news was brought that the false Smerdis had declared himself king. See Herod. iii. 61.  
**12** *Midst.* Lit. “navel.” Heb. “Thabor,” intimating a mountain rising in a plain. Judg. 9:7. C.—Alluding to this intended blunder of the Jews lately returned, he speaks of Antichrist and of all heretics, who seek to pervert or suppress Catholics rescued from the power of the devil, by the sacraments of Christ. W.  
**13** Tharsis*.* Sept. “Carthage, and all their villages.” The merchants or naval forces of Cambyses spurred him forward, (see Ps. 77:6) as well as the Arabs, Cuthites, &c. 1 Esd. 4:8. C.  
**16** *Latter.* Cambyses had punished Egypt, his turn came, and all his designs were baffled.  
**17** *Prophets.* See Is. 14. & 16:21 and 26:1. Jer. 30:3 and 23. Joel 2:30. 3:1. &c.  
**19** *Israel.* The Jews shall be full of dismay, (v. 20) as the tyrant will vent some threats; ( C.) or this commotion was in his own army. H.  
**21** *Sword.* The Jews were not in a condition to make resistance. C.—Cambyses had his brother Smerdis slain. But another was set on the throne; whereupon, mounting his horse in a fury, he wounded himself with his sword in the thigh, which mortifying, caused his death after twenty days. Herod. iii. 21. &c.—The historian does not mention what became of his army; but it seems to have perished by discord, as was very common among such a collection of nations. See Jud. 7:22. Judith 15:1 and 1 K. 14:20 and 4 K. 2:21. C.—They were now without a head. H.—In the whole universe, God will at last destroy Antichrist and all his adherents. W.  
**22** *Pestilence.* His wound might be thus described.—*Blood.* Thus was he punished for shedding that of innocent people. C.

## Chapter 39

**3** *Arrows.* Cambyses thought himself the most skilful at shooting. This was the usual weapon of the Persians ( C.) and Parthians. H.  
**4** *Fall.* In every part some shall resist Antichrist, who shall be overpowered. W.—Cambyses died at Carmel.  
**6** *Islands;* in the naval forces, or in the places of his dominion where discord shall prevail. C.—Cambyses resolved to attack Ethiopia, the people near the temple of Ammon, and the Carthaginians: but his troops refused to go against the latter, and many were smothered in the sands, or starved to death in the other expeditions. Just. i. Lucan x. &c.  
**9** *Years;* for a long time. v. 12. Little fuel is necessary there. Mariana (Hist. xi. 24. A. 1212.) mentions, that the arms of the Moors supplied Spain four years with fuel. C.  
**10** **Ver** **.** **10** **.** *Prey.* The Jews relate that Zorobabel went out to oppose these nations, and took so much plunder as to be able to begin the temple. Theod.  
**11** *East of* the Mediterranean and of Carmel, the high road from Assyria to Egypt, (Gen. 37:2. C.) where the Romans had a station at Legion. Eus.—*Called*, or shall be. Is. 7:14 and 60:14. C.—*Valley.* Sept. “Gai, the grave of Gog.” Prot. “the valley of Haman-Gog.” v. 16. H.—Antichrist will not be burnt iwth material *fire.* But Catholics shall resist him zealously, and gain the victory. W.  
**12** *Land*, to prevent infection, and to comply with the law. Num. 19:16.  
**13** *Day.* It does not occur in the calendar. Yet Comestor and the Carthusian mentions Cambysa, the day when Bethulia was delivered. Jud. 16:31. The history of Judith may perhaps relate to the defeat of this prince. The embellishments will not injure the truth. The Jews immediately after his death recommence the building of the temple, (1 Esd. 4. Agg. 1:14) which they are forced to discontinue, till Hystaspes confirmed the decree of Cyrus. This was the grand object of their desires, and therefore the day when Cambyses fell was ever memorable to them. C. Diss.—So will that be for Christians, when Antichrist shall be no more. M.  
**15** *Buriers.* These might be foreign slaves, or Jews, who followed this employment. C.—They would be habitually ( H.) unclean, and their company would be carefully avoided. Those who sought after the dead remains, contracted no uncleanness. C.  
**16** *Amona* *.* Heb. hamon, ( H.) means “a multitude.” C.—Sept. “a place for many graves:” πολυανδριον. H.—So many would be buried there, that the place might justly receive such a name; though we find no such city in the neighbourhood. C.—Rabbath, of Ammon, was sometimes so called. H.  
**18** *That ar* *e.* Heb. “and of meries, (a species of oxen, in Syria. Bellon. ii. 50.) all of them from Basan,” beyond the Jordan, a most fertile country. Sept. “all calves fattened.”  
**23** *Sword.* I could as easily have protected them against the Chaldeans as against this prince, if their sins had not been in the way. C.—These bring on the ruin of God’s people more than the power of the enemy. W.  
**25** *Isra* *el.* All who please may now return. Hystaspes was very favourable to them. He married Esther, raised Mardochai to great power, and sent Esdras into Judea with ample privileges. Many returned under him, Artazerxes, and Alexander.—*Jealous.* I will restore the people to favour, and will protect them ( C.) like a husband. H.  
**28** *There*, except such as refused to return. They have entire liberty. This and what follows was not fully accomplished till the propagation of the gospel. God wished all to embrace it; and though Israel has been partly blind, they will enter the Church after the Gentiles. Rom. 11:25. C.

## Chapter 40

**1** *Month;* April 30, A. 3430. Usher. C.—In explaining this last most obscure vision: I. The Jews say it was verified after the captivity. But thus the temple would be four miles round, and the city thirty-six, which never was the case. II. Hence more modern Jews assert it will be fulfilled by the Messias. III. Rejecting these errors, Lyran, &c. suppose that the promise was conditional, and that the sins of the Jews prevented the city and temple from being so large; and that the mystical temple of the Church is also insinuated, into which both Jews and Gentiles shall enter. IV. Though this opinion be probable, it seems better to follow S. Jerom, S. Greg. &c. who cannot apply al to the Old Testament, nor think that such a huge temple and city were indeed promised, but explain some parts of the captives at their return, as a figure of those redeemed by Christ, and brought into his Church, which is adorned with all graces. Yet the greatest part must be understood of the Church triumphant. W.—S. Jerom confesses his ignorance of this subject; and those who have come after him, though they imitate not his modesty, add little to dissipate the mist with which this vision is surrounded. Some have adhered too close to Josephus, while Villalpand has here discovered all the magnificence of Greek and Roman architecture, and has represented the temple six times as large as it really was. It seems that the prophet has described the same temple of Solomon which he had seen, that the dimensions might be preserved, and the hopes of the people kept up; ( C.) and that they might comprehend what a loss they actually sustained on account of their sins, ( H.) and might strive to come up to this pattern ( D.) as “near as they should be able,” the wealth of the people being much less than Solomon’s. Grot.—These arguments do not, however, shew that the buildings were to resemble each other. They vary in many particulars; and the prophet would specify what was to be really executed. He says nothing of the ornamental part, and little of the height, which are the most expensive. Houbigant. Pref.—If some things appear to be too grand for the temple of Solomon, and of Zorobabel, we must reflect that the prophet passes from the figure to the Church of Christ, which is not unusual. M.—Alcasar and Bossuet explain it wholly of the Church, so that the letter requires few notes. D.  
**2** *Mountain;* Moria, in spirit. On the eastern side, the road to the city was level. Walls were added after the captivity, on the other sides. Jos. Bel. vi. 6.—*City*, the temple was so large.—*South*, to one coming from the north, though the temple lay on that side of the town. Ps. 47:2. C.—Sept. read mongod, “over-against,” instead of *mongob*, “south,” which has perplexed many. Houbig.—Ezechiel was placed on Sion, which was not *very high*, but here it denotes the Church. Jerusalem was in ruins. W.  
**3** *Brass:* shining. H.—This angel waited for the prophet at the northern gate, but introduced him by that looking towards the east. v. 16.—*Line.* It seems never to have been used. C.  
**5** *Breadth.* Heb. Chal. Sept. “of six cubits, in a cubit and a palm;” imitating that the sacred cubit contained six palms, while the common one had only five, (C. 43:13. W.) being half a yard; (Arbuthnot) or the Hebrew cubit was a hand’s breadth larger than the Babylonian, or about 21½ inches, ( C.) which may be styled ( M.) the sacred cubit. Arb. H.—*Reed.* This outer wall ( C. M.) was to prevent any from falling down the precipice. It was about four yards nine inches in height and thickness, being so solid in order that the ground might not give way. Josephus describes prodigious walls, ( H.) reaching to the bottom of the mountain, three hundred cubits on the south and west; but then the temple was much enlarged. C.  
**6** *And.* In this verse occurs the first of thirty-four words where the *j* is allowed by the keri to be omitted in this one chapter, always when it is the sign of the plural number before a suffixed *v*, and of course by voluntary assimilation. But Camb. MS. 1. has the *j* regularly in the thirty-two of these words. Kennicott.—*Steps.* The ground was not quite level, which caused the buildings to rise one above another more elegantly. There were four great gates.  
**7** *Chamber*, for the porters, ( C.) three on each side of the porch. v. 10. H.  
**11** *Thirteen*, or twenty-six feet high.  
**14** *Cubits* high, or else the elevation is nowhere specified. C.  
**16** *Slanting*, or “lattice.” Sept. “dark.” See 3 K. 7:4. H.—They were larger within, to afford light, as in Solomon’s temple, and in castles. Interpreters disagree in their sentiments: but all allow that God here insinuated that he would reward people in the Old Testament with temporal, and those in the New with spiritual blessings; first with grace in this life, and with glory in the next. W.—Yet we must not suppose that the saints of old were deprived of eternal goods. H.—*About.* The other gates had the like ornaments. C.  
**17** There were *chambers. Gazophylacia*, so called, because the priests and Levites kept in them the stores and vessels that belonged to the temple. Ch.—They went all round the courts. The women were in the second story. Villalpand and Capel, who are deemed the most accurate, suppose that there were no chambers below, but an open gallery. There seem, however, to have been chambers also. C. 8:7. C.  
**18** *Lower.* So that there was a step up to the threshold. H.—Marble was used in all places exposed to the weather. Jos. Bel. vi. 14.  
**26** *Seven.* There were eight to the inner court, (v. 31) shewing that more perfection is now required, and a greater reward given. S. Greg. W.  
**30** *Five cubits.* The parallel passages would intimate “fifty.” C. Villalp.—But the texts all read five, and Maldonat understands the four vacant spaces between the chambers. v. 7. M.  
**38** *Gates.* Heb. is very obscure. The holocausts were slain on the north side of the altar. Lev. 1:11.  
**43** *B* *orders*, to prevent any thing falling. Chal. &c. have “hooks.”  
**44** *North.* The singers occupied two wings.  
**45** *Watch* over the sacred ornaments, perfumes, lamps of the sanctuary, &c. Num. 3:28.  
**46** *Altar.* Not on actual service, (C. 41:13) but to prepare the victims.  
**48** *That side.* Sept. add, “and the opening (ευρος, width) of the gate was 14 cubits, and the breadth (projections, επωμιδες) of the,” &c. ( H.) or the wall on each side of the door was three cubits, so that the porch was 20 cubits broad. C.  
**49** *Eleven.* 3 K. 6 says *ten.* The exact breadth was ten and a half, (Vill. T.) or what the pavement covered is there specified according to some. Sept. Rom. has “twelve.” But the edition of Basil reads more correctly, ten. C.—Yet both ten and eleven may be right, if this temple be different. H.—*Eight.* Heb. seems corrupt, *a* being substituted for *á.* “They mounted by ten steps,” as the Sept. read. Aquila has eleven; Sym. eight.—*Pillars* of brass. 3 K. 7:15. C.—As they are not measured, they were like Solomon’s. W.

## Chapter 41

**1** *The temple.* This plan of a temple, which was here shewn to the prophet in a vision, partly had relation to the material temple, which was to be rebuilt: and partly, in a mystical sense, to the spiritual temple of God, the Church of Christ. Ch.—The description seems grander than Solomon’s; and yet Zorobabel’s temple was meaner than his. Hence this prophecy, and those of Aggeus and Zacharias, cannot be understood of it, but of the Church. S. Jer. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. xviii. 45. W.  
**3** *Front*, or door-posts. The temple was 20 cubits broad.  
**5** *Four.* Herein it differed from Solomon’s chambers, which were in breadth five, six, and seven cubits, in the three stories, respectively. C.  
**6** *One by another*, or *one over another:* literally, *side to side*, or *side upon sid* *e.* Ch.—The word *side* is here equivocal, like Heb. tselá, sometimes denoting the boards, and at other times the apartments round the temple, except on the west, over against the sanctuary, which seems to be the case here. It is true, we shall not easily find sixty-six chambers. But the Heb. &c. have only thirty-three. C.—Villalpand rightly translated *anterides*, (v. 5) but here he substitutes *trabes*, “beams or thick planks,” to make it agree with 3 K. 7:6 as if the same temple were meant. He also adopts the Vulg. *bis.*—*Twice.* Heb. pehamim. Yet he afterwards places in his commentary, pedes, “thirty-three feet, that is twenty-two cubits,” though feet are never used at all as a measure in Scripture. Houbigant.  
**7** *Broader*, as the wall was not so thick. H.—*Midst.* The two staircases were round in the hollow of the wall, ( M.) at the eastern end of the chambers. Jos. See 3 K. C.  
**9** *House.* Because these side-chambers were in the very walls of the temple all around: or it may also be rendered, (more agreeably to the Heb.) so as to signify, that the thickness of the wall for the side-chambers within was the same as that of the wall without; that is, equally five cubits. Ch.—Prot. “and that which was left, *was* the place of the side-chambers that *were* within.” H.—To manifest a greater respect for God, the apartments of the priests were twenty-five cubits from the temple, (v. 10) and divided by a wall, which Josephus describes as three cubits high. Ant. viii. 2. This wall was at the distance of five cubits from the temple. C.  
**11** *Prayer*, or “separated;” munnach, ( H.) the inner house, v. 9.  
**13** *Separate*, different from that v. 9. ( C. Heb. gizra. H.) between the temple and the priests’ apartments, which it may also designate, ( C.) unless it ( H.) mean the temple itself, which was divided from the rest, ( M.) and set aside for *prayer*, &c. H.  
**15** *Galleries; Ethecas*, or as the more correct MSS. of S. Jerom read, Ecthetas, seems to be formed from ( C.) Heb. athikim, ( H.) which S. Jerom explains a balcony, portico, or gallery.  
**16** *About.* Thus he intimates the inner temple, which was covered with boards.—*Windows.* The temple was hidden so far by the chambers; or rather he measured ( C.) “the ground *and* up to the windows, which were” shut up with lattices, affording light over the doors ( H.) and apartments, fifteen cubits from the ground.  
**18** *Two.* Before he describes them with four faces. But they varied, (Ex. 25:18) or the other two might be against the wall. C.—The cherub signified “knowledge,” and the palm-tree victory, to shew that man must be instructed with divine knowledge, and so fight for the victory. The face of man implied that Christ would suffer, and that of a lion announced that he would overcome all his enemies. W.  
**21** *The thr* *eshold was four-square.* That is, the gate of the temple *was four-square*, and so placed as to answer the gate of the sanctuary within. Ch.—It was not an arch, though not a perfect square. 3 K. 6:34.  
**22** **Ve** **r.** **22** **.** *Table*, or altar of incense, larger than that of Moses. Ex. 30:1.  
**23** *Sanctuary.* One folding door opened into it, the other into the temple.  
**24** *Other.* It was not perhaps necessary to open the large door.  
**26** *Sides*, (*humerulis*) or pilasters. Heb. “on the shoulder of the porch, and on the sides of the house, and beams.” C.  

---

## Chapter 42

**1** *And.* S. Jerom finding the Sept. and others varying in the explanations, gives his own; yet adopts the saying of Socrates, “I know that I am ignorant:” for this also is a part of science. W.—*Outward*, with respect to the temple. It is styled inner court, with reference to that of the people.—*Separate.* C. 41:9.  
**3** *Triple*, one over another, (v. 6) or on a level with the priests’ court.  
**4** *One cubit*, projecting out perhaps for seats, or for the pilasters.  
**5** *Above.* The higher stories are not so lofty.  
**6** *Fifty cubits.* We only allow thirty, as this is not in Heb. &c. The text, v. 10 and 12, seems incorrect. C.  
**13** *Holies.* Heb. “who are very holy,” and ( H.) on duty. See Lev. 6:25.  
**14** *People.* C. 44:17. Ex. 28:42. Christian priests use their vestments only when they are officiating. Durand and Durant Rit. ii. 9. C.  
**16** *Five.* Heb. emoth should be meoth, “three hundred, as it is printed (yet not in the Prot. version. H.) thrice just after, and as it is written here in MS. 4. Camb. 1. 2.” Kennicott.—*Reeds.* Sept. “cubits,” as Heb. S. Jer. &c. insinuate. The mountain was only five hundred paces square, even when it was enlarged in the time of Josephus. Bel. vi. 14. Gr.—We must therefore read cubits. C.—If we retain reeds, ( H.) the wall will be twelve thousand cubits, ( M.) which seems improbable. Tournemine. See C. 45. H.  
**20** *Cubits* *.* This confirms the former correction. v. 16. H.—Heb. has only, “of five hundred.” Maldonat and A. Lapide would understand *reeds*, to agree with what goes before. M.—*Separation.* Josephus mentions a wall three cubits high, on the pillars of which was written in Greek and Latin, that such as entered the temple must be pure, ( C.) and *no stranger.* H.—Into this court all might come. Philo. C.

## Chapter 43

**2** *Majesty.* The world is enlightened by the preaching of the gospel; and the Church triumphant shall shine in perfection, when that which is sown in corruption shall put on incorruption. 1 Cor. 15. S. Jer.—The blessed Virgin conceiving Jesus Christ may be insinuated. S. Tho. p. 3. q. 27. a. 3. W.  
**3** *He came.* Heb. “I came to destroy (Sept. to anoint) the city,” marking such as should be spared. C. 9. The glorious chariot entered by the eastern gate, and the prophet followed to the court of the priests., v. 5. 13. C.—The Jews says the second temple was deprived of the *Sheki* *nah*, or glory of the Lord. Yet it seems here to enter; and Christ himself adorned this second house, more than the first, by his adorable presence. Agg. 2:8. H.  
**7** *Said.* The Lord spoke, (Chal. Theod.) or the angel, (S. Jer.) in human shape. H.—He addresses the prophet, v. 12 to C. 44:5 though what follows immediately seems to belong to the Lord, ( C.) in whose name he speaks.—*Name.* God hath abandoned the synagogue, but will remain with his Church unto the end. Mat. 23:38 and 28:20. Yet the perfect Church, *without spot*, is the triumphant; (Eph. 5:27. W.) though the Catholic Church, on earth, is every holy and “the communion of saints.” H.—*Carcasses.* Idols, according to some; or rather by the kings being buried on Sion. This is nowhere else reprehended; neither is their building too near the temple, which the prophet here condemns. v. 8. C.—It seems, however, that if these things had been blameable, such a number of pious and wise kings would not have acted thus, nor the prophets have neglected to admonish them of their duty. The carcasses and houses here specified may have been vestiges of idolatry; or, in future, the tombs and palaces were to be at a more respectful distance. H.  
**8** *Wall.* The kings of Juda had a door communicating with the temple, by which they entered on the west. It was guarded by Levites. 1 Par. 26:16. Ezechiel places no door on that side. Yet in Herod’s temple we find one leading to the adjacent palace, and three others into the town. Jos. Ant. xv. 14.  
**9** *Carcasses.* Lit. “ruins.” H.—The remains of the dead were probably not disturbed; but no more, that we know of, were placed on Sion. C.—*Kings* may signify idols, Moloc, &c. which they had worshipped, and which some had even placed in the holy place, to the nation’s ruin. H.  
**10** *Meas* *ure*, that they may be convinced of their ingratitude, ( M.) which has deprived them of so noble a structure, and put them under the necessity of beginning so great a work again. It required all the exertions of the prophets to make them go forward with it. Agg. 1. H.  
**11** *In* the whole fabric, ( M.) as thou hast described it, ( H.) or received from the angel, with all the ceremonies to be observed.  
**12** *Border.* Nothing but the temple shall be on his mountain. It shall be wholly consecrated to the Lord. This was ill observed. The Asmonean princes erected the famous tower Antonia, at the north side. Jos. See v. 8. The Jews assert that it was unlawful to spit on this ground, &c. but no such thing is specified in Josephus or in Scripture, only we find that none were to go out by the same door at which they had entered, (C. 46:9. C.) except the king.  
**13** *By.* Heb. “by cubits.” This cubit is a *common* cubit, &c. The Babylonian, ( H.) or sacred one, was a palm longer. W. C. 40:5.—*Breadt* *h.* It was the same as the depth, being designed to convey the blood by a conduit to the torrent Cedron.—*Trench*, or *bottom* aforesaid. Sept. “the height.” H.—Chal. “disposition of the altar,” which seems best.  
**14** *Cubit.* they were each a cubit broad, but this *greater* means higher up. Some assert that the priests stood on this base to avoid treading on the altar, when they place the wood or victims. But it would be too low; and steps were made for that purpose. The altar was ten, or rather twelve cubits high, and as many broad. Solomon’s was ten high and twenty broad. Herod’s was a square of forty cubits, raised fifteen from the ground. C.  
**15** *The ariel.* That is, the altar itself, or rather the highest part of it, upon which the burnt-offerings were laid. In the Heb. it is harel, that is, *the mountain of God;* but in the following verse haariel, that is, *the lion of God;* a figure, from its consuming, and as it were devouring the sacrifices as a lion devours its prey. Ch.—Fire descending sometimes from heaven. S. Jer. W.—It also appeared like a little *mountain* in the court. See Is. 29:1. The altar was probably made of brass, like Solomon’s. Josephus and Philo say that rough stones were used after the captivity: but it seems little attention was paid to the dimensions of the temple, &c. given by Ezechiel. C.—Yet the prophets were present to see the laws of God executed, and never complain of their infringement in these particulars, which were attended with no great difficulty. C. 40:1. H.—It is certain the Jews never thought themselves bound to make their altars of a determinate size.  
**17** *Crown*, which was usually placed round altars and tables, that nothing might fall down.—*Bottom* of the altar, or base, mentioned v. 13.—*Steps*, boarded one each side. Ex. 20:26.  
**19** *Levites.* Heb. “of the race of Levi, of the family of Sadoc.” He had obtained the dignity under Saul, ( C.) and after the deposition of Abiathar, under Solomon, (3 K. 2:26. H.) his posterity always preserved it. C. Diss.—*Calf.* Thou shalt give it, or make known these rites to the priests. H.—People are often said to do what they only command, as v. 20, &c.  
**21** *Sanctuary*, out of the precincts of the temple, but on the mountain. Lev. 4:3 and 6:11.  
**22** *He-goat.* Sept. add, “of the goats,” (*hircum caprarum* *.* H.) denoting a young kid, ( M.) or one selected ( H.) rather from the flock. C.  
**26** *Consecrate it.* Lit. “fill his hand;” that is, dedicate and apply it to holy service, ( Ch.) as the Heb. &c. speak of the altar. Sept. “they shall fill their hands,” seems more natural, (Ex. 28:41) and is adopted by Pagn. Vat. &c. C.

## Chapter 44

**2** **Ver.** **2–3** **.** *Opened.* No man perfectly understands the Scriptures but the Son of God. Mat. 11:27. S. Jer.—This also insinuates, that Mary ever remained a pure virgin. S. Aug. &c. W.—*Shut*, even *for the prince.* Some ( H.) kings of Juda claimed the privilege of entering by it at any time, and passed through a part of the court assigned to the priests. 2 Par. 6:12 and 4 K. 16:18. This shall be no longer tolerated. The gate might be opened in the week days if the prince wished to offer sacrifice, but not else, except on the sabbaths. C. 46:1, 12.—*Lord*, in peace offerings and religious feasts.—*Porch.* Each had two doors. C. 46:2. C.  
**4** *Face.* This astonishment and attention (v. 5) intimate the mysteries of the Church, prefigured by the Jewish rites. W.  
**5** *Ways*, or “the going in,” and all that concerns the temple and sacrifices.  
**7** *Flesh.* People of this description were not to enter the temple, which is here called the *sanctuary*, even though they adored God. In some cases pagans were admitted into any part, except the most holy. Epiphanes ( C.) and Pompey forced their passage thither, to the great sorrow of the Jews. Jos. Bel. i. 5. See Eccli. 52. Acts 21:28.—During the plundering of the city, the Chaldees did the like; (Lam. 1:10. H.) and while idols were set up, all rules were neglected.—*Doings.* You observe the exterior, and not the spirit of religion.  
**8** *You* *rselves*, out of ambition, contrary to the regulations of David. C.  
**10** *Levites*, or priests, ( H.) who were seduced by Jeroboam, or offered victims on the high places. 4 K. 23:9. Such lost their privileges and were condemned to serve in the meanest offices. It seems the race of Ithamar was alone guilty, and the threat against his house was now put in execution. 1 K. 2:27. and 3:14. Lev. 21:17 and 2 Esd. 7:64. C.  
**11** *Slay.* Levites might do this, but the priests poured the blood round the altar. v. 15. They could not well slay all the victims.  
**15** *And Levites*, of the higher order. H.—No simple Levites wee of this family. It enjoyed the high priesthood from the time of Solomon.  
**17** *Court;* that is to do duty.—*Linen.* Wool might have been taken from a dead sheep, which would render the person unclean. C.  
**18** *Sweat*, or so as to make them perspire. Sept. “girded violently.” H.—They must have liberty to move, (S. Jer.) and have the girdle about their breast. Braun.  
**19** **9** **.** *Sanctify*, by exposing them to the danger of touching the sacred vestments, which none were to touch but they that were sanctified. Ch.—*Sanctify* here means to defile. Ex. 30:29. C. and 29:37. Holy things must be done in holy places. W.—Divine religion has different *clothing* for the ministry, from what is used in common life. S. Jer. Ex. 28:40. C.  
**20** Shave, like the priests of Isis. Juv. vi.  
**21** *Wine.* Lev. 10:9. The priests on duty abstain from wine. Jos. Bel. vi. 15.  
**22** *Widow.* Moses laid this restraint upon the high priest. Lev. 21:13. C.  
**25** *Unclean*, attending the funeral, which inferior priests alone might do. Lev. 21:10. M.  
**27** *Day*, after the seven first, ( C.) though this would be a new regulation. M.  
**28** *No.* This is omitted in Heb. Sept. &c. God was their portion. C.—They had no land but what lay near their cities. H.

## Chapter 45

**1** *By lot.* MS. 2 reads bogurl; (printed *benachala*) so the Vulg. *sortito* *.* Kennicott.—Heb. “when you shall make the land fall,” which usually implies by lot: yet the partition was not made thus, (C. 48:1) nor at all, ( C.) otherwise the prophet might mention how the lots would have fallen to Dan, in the north, &c. H.—The Jews either could not comply, or did not take this to be a command. If they had returned all together, they might probably have put it in execution. But many of them preferred staying where they had gotten a settlement, and the rest only returned in small parties, some not before the reign of Alexander. Those who arrived first, occupied as much as possible their ancient limits. 1 Esd. 3:1. and 2 Esd. 8. and 11. C.—*Thousand:* reeds, or cubits. Ch.—Many prefer the latter, which is specified v. 2. ( H.) as it agrees with the dimensions of the temple. C. 42:16. If *reeds* or *toises* were meant, the city would be disproportionate with the rest of the divisions: 50,000 would make 25 leagues, of 2,500 paces each; and if each tribe had as much, the country must have comprised 325 leagues, whereas from Emath to Cadesbarne (C. 47:17) there at not above 150. C.—To form an idea of the proposed partition, we must suppose the country reached from a little north of Emesa, on the Orontes, to Cadesbarne south, and from the Mediterranean to Damascus, or a little farther east, and beyond the sources of Jazer. 1. Dan, 2. Aser, 3. Nephthali, 4. Manasses, 5. Ephraim, 6. Ruben, 7. Juda, had about equal portions with that designed for 8. the temple, the Levites, and prince, whose southern limits reached almost to Accaron and the Dead Sea. 9. Benjamin, 10. Simeon, 11. Issachar, 12. Zabulon, and 13. Gad, had each about half the quantity of the others, though the tribes occupied the whole extent from east to west, their lots being marked out by parallel lines. Between Juda and Benjamin, a square of 500 cubits was assigned for the temple; another square of 4,500, or 18,000 in circuit, lay round the former for the city of the Levites: round this were suburbs 250 cubits broad, walled about, and having three gates on each side. Next them dwelt their lay servants, in a space 5,000 cubits broad, and 25,000 long, from east to west. A plot of ground on the north and south, sufficient to complete this square was to support them with provisions. On the east side of the Jordan, and on the west of this square for the priests and their servants, two portions almost of equal dimensions with it, were appropriated to the prince. His lot was 25,000 cubits long, and 12,500 broad. C. 48:21. See Calmet’s plan. H.—*About.* It couldn ot be alienated to private men, or for any other purpose. W.  
**2** *Suburbs.* Heb. also, “vacant spaces.”  
**3** *Measure*, from the centre of the temple; so that the dimensions given must be doubled, (C. 48:10) as also v. 5.  
**4** *Place.* There the priests shall dwell.  
**5** *Chambers* for the Levites on duty. Sept. read, “towns.” But only one seems to be specified, 18,000 cubits in circumference.  
**6** *According.* Heb. “along *or* ( C.) over-against the oblation of the holy portion.” Prot.—*Israel*, destined to serve the priests. H.  
**7** *Border.* Two equal lots, one on the east and the other on the west, were assigned the prince, each 20,000 cubits broad, and 12,500 long. C. 48:21. C.—He dwelt near the priests, for their protection; as the people were on both sides of him, that he might sustain no injury. W.  
**8** *Rob.* Instead of their *right*, (1 K. 8:11) the source of continual vexations, a certain revenue is specified, v. 13.  
**9** *Confines:* encroach not. C.—Heb. and Sept. “take away your oppressions;” ( H.) Chal. “scandals.” C.  
**11** *The ephi and the bate.* These measures were of equal capacity; but the *bate* served for liquids, and the *ephi* for dry things. Ch. v. 13, 14. W.—Ezechiel specifies the measures, that the people might not use those of Babylon, after their return.  
**12** *Sicles.* It would be shorter to say, “sixty sicles make a mna.”  
**13** *Take*, for the prince’s revenue. He had the sixtieth part of corn and of oil; or rather ( C.) he had an exact tithe of the latter. v. 14. Chal. M.  
**15** *One ram* *.* He shall receive the tithe of sheep, &c. and take one out of two hundred, on condition that he furnish victims. v. 17. C.—The obligation was mutual. S. Jerom explains it of the high priest and people. W.  
**17** *Holocaust.* This was given before perhaps *gratis.* 2 Par. 31:3. Solomon and Ezechias shewed great magnificence. After the captivity the people laid on the third of a sicle per head, as this order was not observed. 2 Esd. 10:32.  
**18** *Take*, or order the priests to do this annually, to prepare for the Passover. v. 21. Moses mentions nothing of this, and it does not appear to have been put in execution. C.—Yet it might be the first year after the dedication of the temple. The prophet does not say it was to be done every year. H.  
**20** *Seventh*, or so many days before the solemn feast. Sept. “on the first of the seventh month,” the feast of trumpets. Num. 29:1. C.  
**24** *Sacrifice.* Heb. mincha, flour. Prot. “meat offering.” H.  
**25** *Day:* the feast of tabernacles, to be observed like the Pasch. Num. 29:12. C.

## Chapter 46

**2** *Prince.* After the captivity, although the race of David continued in Salathiel, Zorobabel, &c. yet they had not the state of kings. Hence Christians, R. David and other Jews, understand this of the Messias and the rites of his Church, with a literal allusion to the old law. W.—*Without*, not proceeding into the court of the priests. C. 44:2.  
**4** *Six.* Moses only prescribed two lambs for every day. Num. 28:9.  
**5** *Sacrifice.* See C. 45:24. Flour and oil accompanied the victim. When lambs were presented, this was left to the prince’s devotion (v. 7 and 11. C.) only. If he gave three or four ephies of flour, he must give as many *hins* of *oil.* H.  
**6** *Calf.* Moses orders two, and seven lambs. Num. 28:11. C.—*The rams.* Heb. “a ram. They shall,” &c. H.  
**9** *It*, perhaps to avoid confusion, ( M.) and turning the back on the temple, ( C.) or to exercise their obedience. As many might enter by one gate as by another, and thus the concourse would not be diminished. H.  
**10** *Out.* The prince went in and out by the same gate, (v. 8) and might order that on the east to be opened when he had to offer a voluntary sacrifice. In other respects he was like a simple Israelite, and was to attend the temple and use the same gates as the rest. Before, the kings had a gate on the west leading to their palace. But this was no longer to subsist, and the palace was to be far removed. C. 48:21.  
**11** *Solemnities.* Heb. “on feasts and on days of meeting.” C.—*Sacrifice:* mincha*.* v. 7, and C. 45:24. H.  
**13** *Morning.* That for the evening had the same ceremonies. Lev. 6:9.  
**14** **Ve** **r.** **14** **.** *By. Cata* seems to be taken C. from the Gr. κατα, “according to,” or *by.* v. 15. H.  
**17** *Sons.* If any portion of his land was made over to them, it still remained in the family; but if any other had a present of it, the land must revert to the royal family, agreeably to the law. Lev. 25:10. C.—This insinuates that works done by the true children of God, in the state of grace, merit an eternal reward, while moral good works performed in the state of sin, can only have a temporal one. W.  
**19** *Gate*, on the north. C. 44:4.—*West.* At this corner was the kitchen for victims, which could only be eaten in the inner court. If they had been brought into that without, the people would have become unclean; as it is equally wrong to touch holy or impure things when they are forbidden. C. 44:19. There were four other kitchens for the people who might choose to eat their peace-offerings. v. 24. C.  
**22** *Little.* Heb. “courts joined.” Prot. or marg. “made with chimneys,” ( H.) or “smoked,” as no chimneys were used. Sept. “little courts,” as they have read differently. C.—Vulg. unites both meanings. H.  
**24** *Kitchens.* Sept. “porticoes,” or rather ( C.) “boiling places;” Prot. and v. 24. H.

## Chapter 47

**1** *Waters.* These waters are not to be understood literally, (for there were none such that flowed from the temple) but mystically of the baptism of Christ, and of his doctrine and his grace; the trees that grow on the banks are Christian virtues; the fishes are Christians, that spiritually live in and by these holy waters; the fishermen are the apostles, and apostolic preachers; the fenny places, where there is no health, are such as by being out of the Church are separated from these waters of life. Ch.—It is not probable that real water or fishes were found, v. 9. But this must be explained of the Church and of baptism, in a higher and more proper sense. W.—Joel, (3:18) before the captivity, and Zacharias, (14:8) after that event, speak of fountains as still *to appear*, and of course not in either temple, though Pilate made aqueducts for the purpose, (Jos. Bel. ii. 13.) which Tacitus, (An. v.) Maundrel, (p. 148.) and others mention. But the prophets allude not to them, but to Christ, the fountain of water springing up unto life eternal. John 4:14 and 7:38. C.—Villalpand understands it of waters brought into the temple to wash the victims; but it seems to refer more to the grace and doctrine of Christ. M.  
**2** *East.* This gate was shut, and therefore he went out at the north gate. C.  
**8** *The.* Heb. “the east country,” (Prot. H.) or “the frontiers (Gelilah) eastward,” by which some improperly suppose that one rivulet went to the sea of Galilee.—*And shall.* Heb. “the sea of the going out,” where the Jordan River empties itself into the Dead Sea; or, the second rivulet ran into the Mediterranean. Zac. 14:8. But this passage relates to the Dead Sea alone, (v. 18) and Gelilah is a place near it, where the Israelites erected an altar of union. Jos. 22:10. C.—*Healed.* No fish can live in the sea of Sodom. Solin xxxviii.—Yet, let the place be ever so noxious, this water shall cure it; (see 4 K. 2:19. C.) which must be taken in a mystical sense. H.  
**10** **0** **.** *Engallim*, or “the fountain of Gallim,” in the tribe of Benjamin. 1 Sam. 25:44.  
**11** *Salt*, or bitumen *pits.* Schismatics and bad Christians, who do not live by the spirit of Christ, are meant.  
**12** *First-fruits*, or most excellent. H.—S. John saw such W. a *tree of life.* Apoc. 22. H.—The doctrine of the gospel, and the study of the sacred books, have the most salutary effects; while the very *leaves*, or the example of the saints, heal the soul. No more shall the deceitful fruits near Sodom be seen ( C.) beautiful, but full of nothing but ashes. Tacit. An. v.—Where Christ instructs, a torrent of grace and glory is presently formed. Like the mustard seed growing into a large tree, in which the birds rest, its origin in mean; yet its progress is grand and astonishing.  
**13** *Double* *portion.* Lit. “cord.” H.—His two sons would each have a share, as *Levi* was better provided for. W.—He had no portion of the land assigned to him by Josue, but here one part is appointed ( C.) for the sacred ministers and the prince. C. 45:1.  
**14** *Brother.* The seven tribes to the north have each an equal share, as the five who lay to the south of the Levites had with respect to each other, though their portion must have been only about half of what the former possessed, according to the map. C. 45:1. H.—Under Josue, the numbers of each tribe were considered. The present mysterious equality shews, perhaps, that there is no distinction of Jew or Gentile in the Church, and that Christ would come to redeem all. C.—*Lifted.* People taking an oath acted in this manner. M.  
**15** *Sedada* *.* These places are not well known. They seem to be near the *highest mountain* specified, (Num. 34:7) west of Emesa.  
**16** Berotha, conquered by David. 2 K. 8:8.  
**17** Emath was about the middle of the northern limits, between the Mediterranean and the Euphrates.  
**18** Auran*.* Hence a line must be drawn through Damascus over Mount Galaad to the eastern or Dead Sea, to form the eastern borders. C.—The Jordan flowing from Genesareth to Sodom marked out this side, ( M.) or rather was in this division; though the land as far as Galaad was to belong to Israel, as it had been before the captivity. Prot. “*by* Jordan from the border unto,” &c. H.  
**19** Thamar. Engaddi is sometimes understood: but it lay near Jericho, as this ( C.) Thamar was to the south of the Dead Sea. Ptolemy.—*Torrent*, Besor. H.  
**20** Emath, not that it was on the sea: but a line was to be drawn over against this city, eastward from the Mediterranean. Sept. “to opposite the entrance of Emath, as far as its entrance.” But the territory extended farther. Num. 34.  
**22** *Strangers.* This was never done by the Jews. It signifies that Christ would give an inheritance, in the true land of promise, ( C.) to all nations which should practice his religion. Rom. 10:12. H.

## Chapter 48

**1** *Dan.* This division is very different from that of Josue, and was never literally executed, being rather of a mystical nature. The limits are not marked out, as each lot was equal. C. See C. 45:1 and 47:14. H.—By the twelve tribes all the glorified saints are meant. No cities of refuge occur, because in heaven all are perfect, all secure. S. Jer. W.  
**8** *Apart*, for the Levitical tribe and the prince. C.—As the first-born and things which spring first, so also the land consecrated to the Lord is called first-fruits. W.—*Thousand* cubits (C. 45:1 or 12,500 paces, ( H.) allowing two cubits for each. This would not reach to the Jordan River. But thrice that space must be reckoned, the king having two of them ( C.) on each side of the temple, namely, towards the sea, and on the other side of the Jordan. H.  
**11** *Astray*, &c. By this we see, that in the worst of times God always preserves some of the priests from going astray; an that the synagogue never fell so universally into idolatry, but that a remnant was still left free from this corruption. Ch.  
**13** *Ten.* Their city was only 18,000 cubits in circumference. v. 16.  
**15** *Profane*, where servants of the priests may reside. C.—On the north and south, ( H.) 1000 cubits broad and 25,000 long were left for fields, gardens, &c. C.  
**16** *Five.* Heb. has, “five five hundred:” but one *five* is properly omitted in several MSS. and in all the ancient versions. Kennicott.—Four thousand five hundred cubits was the length and breadth of the town and temple, which were 18,000 cubits round, ( C.) or so many reeds, which would make 36 miles of 1000 paces each. As the earthly Jerusalem was certainly never so large, the modern rabbins assert that the Messias will build it to that extent; but Catholic doctors understand it mystically of the Church. Thus S. John saw the New Jerusalem or Church triumphant. Apoc. 21 and 22 W.  
**17** *Suburbs*, separating the Levites from laics, different from what is mentioned v. 15.  
**18** *As the*, &c. They shall not be alienated, as some might infer from its being said to be *profane*, which term is used because it was the habitation of laymen.  
**19** *Israel.* People from all parts might serve the Levites. This tribe was not to engage in labourious or sordid employments, being attached to the service of the Lord, and bound to instruct others. But this was more perfectly fulfilled in the Christian Church, where the clergy enjoy great immunities, and are forbidden to exercise any trade or employment which may take them off from their more important spiritual concerns, or render their ministry contemptible. See Ex. 19:6.  
**20** *City*, where the Levites and their servants, artisans, &c. dwelt. C.  
**21** *Thereof.* The domains of the prince touched the limits of Juda on the north, and of Benjamin on the south, as the portion of Levi did also. The prince occupied the east and west square of this division. H.  
**28** *Inheritance.* Heb. nachal, signifies also “torrent;” and S. Jerom seems to prefer this meaning, as he explains it of the torrent which goes by Rhinocorura, and is commonly supposed to be the southern boundary. C.  
**30** *Out*, or gates. H.—There were three on each of the four sides. C.  
**35** *The Lord is there.* This name is here given to the city; that is, the Church of Christ; because the Lord is always with her till the end of the world. Mat. 28:20. Ch.—He always adorns the Church triumphant; (Apoc. 22) but has deserted the synagogue. Mat. 23:38. W.—Jerusalem certainly never bore this name, nor is it requisite that she should, if the prophecy had been literally understood. It would suffice, if she could justly claim such a prerogative. See Is. 7:14 and 2 K. 12:25. The Church of Christ possesses God for ever. C.
