# 1 Maccabees Commentary

**These** Books are so called, because they contain the history of the people of God under the command of *Judas Machabeus* and his brethren; and he, as some will have it, was surnamed *Machabeu* *s* from carrying on his ensigns, or standards, those words of Exodus 15:11. “Who is like to thee among the strong, O Lord;” in which the initial letters, in the Hebrew, are M. C. B. E. I. It is not known who was the author of these books. But as to their authority, though they are not received by the Jews, saith S. Augustine, (l. xviii. de civ. Dei. c. xxxvi.) they are received by the Church; who, in settling her canon of the Scriptures, chose rather to be directed by the tradition she had received from the apostles of Christ, than by that of the Scribes and Pharisees. And as the Church has declared these two books canonical, even in two general councils, viz. Florence and Trent, there can be no doubt of their authenticity. Ch.—The most ancient Father, Clem. (Strom. i.) S. Cyprian, (1 ep. iii. ad. Cornel.) S. Ambrose, (Off. i. 41. &c.) quote them as divine; and the third Council of Carthage, Trent, &c. have inserted them in the canon. Though ( W.) S. Jerom did not translate ( C.) or urge them against the Jews, he had a great regard for them. In Dan. 1 and 11. &c. The texts to which Protestants object, will be explained. They are not more difficult than many which occur in the Books of Kings and Paralipomenon. Other books have been formerly contested, which they now admit. The author of the second books seems to have designed at first only to insert two supplements. He then resolved to abridge the work of Jason, and hence added a preface, (C. ii. 20.) which may be first perused. He then gives an account of some who had suffered death for the truth; and in the eighth and following chapters, the victories of the Machabees, which had been partly recorded in the first book, are specified, with some fresh circumstances. Judas was styled the Machabee for his strength and valour, ( W.) being “the scourge” of God, ( H.) or because he was an exterminator. M.—Yet the etymology is not well ascertained. That given above, (Zac. 12:5. H.) or M. C. B. I. (Buxt. Prideaux, &c.) seems to be overthrown, by the Syriac having always *k* instead of *c*, which is the case in two Chaldee MSS. These may not contain a truer history, but they rectify several mistakes in the printed copies. Kennicott.—S. Jerom found the first of these books in Heb. the second in Greek. Ep. 106. We have a third also in Greek, in the Comp. Bible; as well as a fourth, mentioned by Sixtus, (Bib. i. W.) “on the administration of Hircan,” ( C.) to which reference seems to be made 1 Mac. 15:24. ( W.) though what is extant be a work of no authority. “The empire of reason,” falsely attributed to Josephus, and printed among his works, is more probably the fourth book, known to the ancients. Neither of these latter were ever deemed canonical by any authentic decree. W.—Many have indeed ranked the with the other contested works: but now it is generally agreed that they belong not to the sacred Scriptures, as the two former do. On these ( C.) indeed, as almost on all the sacred books, ( H.) authors have varied: but he most respectable and the most numerous declare in their favour. To arrange the four books in chronological order, we must make the first and third exchange places. This last can obtain its title only inasmuch as the Jews of Alexandria, who were persecuted by Philopator, and miraculously delivered, were animated with the same sentiments of piety and heroism as the rest of the Machabees. C. See Ecclesiasticus 50:1. 21. 23. H.—The authors of the first and second books relate many of the same events; yet seem not to have seen each other’s works. The latter follows the Greek chronology, dating from *Tisri*, Sept. and October, ( C.) A. 3828 to 3843, ( H.) while the former dates from *Nisan*, ( C.) our March or April, A. 3829 to 3869. The third book gives an account of Philopator’s persecution in Egypt, A. 3787. The fourth, A. 3869 to 3698, ( H.) is little known among the Latins. Calmet gives two copies, the one regarding Hircan and the other “the government of reason,” or the martyrdom of the Machabees, A. 3837; ( H.) the author of which last seems to have been a Stoic. C.—We shall pass them over, with Protestants, as they are not received by the Catholic Church. H.

## Chapter 1

**1** *Now.* Lit. “And.” H.—Thus many Heb. books commence, as Ex. Jos. Bar. &c. C.—*Greece*, over the whole. He was chosen generalissimo. H.—He conquered many of the Greeks, and overthrew Darius Condomanus, A. 3674. C.—His dominion in Syria may be meant. Grot.—Alexander was the first who reigned in that great monarchy, which he founded. W.  
**2** *Holds.* He was never defeated. Just. xii.  
**3** *Earth*, even to India, beyond which the ancients knew of nothing.—*Quiet*, or silent; depopulated, (Is. 14:7) and obedient. Hab. 2:20.  
**4** *Up.* He was spoiled by prosperity, ( C.) and would pass for a god, and be styled “king of the world.” Just. xii.  
**6** *Bed.* Some suppose through poison, (Diod. xvii. S. Jer. ad Lætam.) or excess of wine. Athen. x. 11.—This was enough. H.—So perished the man who would claim divine honours! C.  
**7** *Servants.* On the ninth day of sickness which preceded his death, he admitted all his soldiers to kiss his hand. Then he asked his friends, if they thought they should find such another king? As they were silent, he predicted what bloodshed would ensue, and told them to bury him in the temple of Ammon. When they asked to whom he left the throne, he said, “to the most worthy.” He gave his ring to Perdiccas; whence all inferred, that he should be regent till the proper heirs came of age. Perdiccas desired to know when he would have divine honours: to which Alexander replied with these his last words, “when you are happy:” (Just. xii. Diod. xvii.) as much as to say, never. H.—This seems contrary to the sacred historian. But his authority is far superior. C.—*Kingdom.* This is otherwise by Q. Curtius; though he acknowledges that divers were of that opinion, and that it had been delivered by some authors. l. x. But here we find from the sacred text that he was in error. Ch.—By delivering his ring to Perdiccas, Alexander gave him authority to make this division. W.—Many assert, that he gave him directions in his last will. This was observed for some time. v. 10.  
**8** *Twelve.* Jos. &c. Some add, a few months. He was about thirty-three years old.  
**10** *Death*, twelve years being expired, when all the posterity of Alexander were dead. His generals gradually destroyed each other, and four took the diadem at the same time: Ptolemy, in Egypt; Seleucus, in Syria; Cassander, in Macedonia; and Lysimachus, in Thrace. Just. xiii. and xv. C.—Those who choose to read in order, may, after the preface 2 B. 2:20 read the above, then 2 B. 3:1. W.  
**11** *Antiochus the illustrious;* Epiphanes, the younger son of Antiochus the great, who usurped the kingdom, to the prejudice of his nephew Demetrius, son of his elder brother, Seleucus Philopater. Ch.—Epiphanes means “renowed.” W.—He took this title, particularly after the Samaritans had offered it to him. Jos. 12. Vaillant. A. 145.—His medals have always *God* prefixed, “the god appearing;” as he came opportunity, like a god, to defend the kingdom against the Egyptians, after he had been fourteen years a hostage at Rome. C.—Nothing could be more abject than his character. S. Jer. in Dan. viii. and ix. Athen. v. 4. and x. 12.—*Greeks*, counting not from the beginning of the reign of Alexander, but from the first year of Seleucus Nicator. Ch.—The era of the Seleucides began in spring or autumn, A. 3692, B.C. 312, though the Chaldees and Ptolemy date from the following spring. C.—The Grecian monarchy had then stood twenty years. Eus. W.  
**12** *Men.* Jason attempted to supplant Onias III. and introduced pagan customs, when he was dead. Menelaus treated him in like manner. Being cited to pay what he had promised, he left Lysimachus in his place, who was slain in the temple, which he was robbing. 2 Mac. 4.—*Us.* Thus the Jews complained in the days of Jeremias, (44:18) and the Christian religion was blamed for all the miseries which fell upon the Roman empire. C.—S. Aug. proves in his City of God, that this accusation was false. H.  
**15** *Exercise*, to wrestle ( C.) and teach. Lyran.  
**16** *Made.* S. Jerom thinks the attempt useless. But the Jews discovered the art. S. Epip. Pond. xvi. Bartol. 1 Cor. 7:18.—*Sold* to the devil, becoming his instruments. 3 K. 21:25. Rom. 7:14. C.—Go to 2 Mac. 4:7.  
**17** *Egypt.* He coveted this kingdom, having Syria already. W.—He was not very fit for war: but Egypt was not under Philometor a child, and Ephphanes made an easy conquest. This was his second visit to that country. While he besieged Alexandria, a report of his death was spread; and as he was informed that the Jews rejoiced at it, he fell upon them. v. 21. C.—After v. 20, read 2 B. 4:21. W.  
**23** *Sanctuary.* Josephus (xii. 6.) writes that Antiochus slew such as opposed his entrance into the city, and afterwards those who opened the gates, but would have prevented his plundering the temple. W.—Menelaus conducted the king. 2 Mac. 5:15. Profane authors condemn this conduct of the king towards a city subject to him. Jos. c. App. 2.—Diodorus relates several fables on this occasion. C.  
**30** *The chief collector*, &c. Apollonius. Ch. 2 Mac. 5:24. W.—He basely fell upon the unsuspecting citizens on a sabbath day. H.  
**33** *Fire*, thus destroying a great part. Jos. Ant. xii. 7.  
**35** *The city of David.* That is, the castle of Sion. Ch.—In it was placed a garrison of Macedonians. W.—This castle had been occupied by Syrians before. It was now enlarged. 2 Mac. 4:27 and 5:5.  
**38** *Sanctuary*, to pillage all who came to the temple. C.—*An evil devil.* Literally, an adversary, watching constantly to do harm, as the evil spirit is always watching and seeking whom he could devour. Ch.  
**40** *Fled* with Judas, &c. 2 Mac. 5. Josephus (xii. 7.) assures us that the Samaritans flattered Epiphanes, and begged their temple might be consecrated to Jupiter, &c. The pretended that they were of Sidonian extraction.  
**43** *Be one.* This reason herself teaches. But the king wished to establish a false religion, or rather he desired to root out all religion, and to shew his authority. H.—*Demere superstitionem & mores Græcorum dare adnixus* *.* Tacit. v.—He was not content with plunder, unless he ruined souls. W.  
**45** *Service*, or worship, ( C.) introduced by Epiphanes. H.  
**49** *People.* He forced them to eat forbidden meat.  
**57** *Fifteenth.* In all other places the 25th, whence this may be incorrect, ( C.) or the altar was now set up, ( H.) though sacrifices were not yet offered. C.—*Idol.* The statue of Jupiter Olympius, ( Ch.) as Daniel (9) had foretold, as a figure of what antichrist would do, (Mat. 24. W.) as well as the Romans, when they took Jerusalem.  
**58** *Doors*, to Trivia. Isai. 57:8. C.  
**59** *Law*, and all the sacred writings. Jos. Sulpit. ii.—The pious Jews secreted what they could, and Judas took care to collect them. 2 B. 1:14 and 3:38. C.  
**61** *After month.* The officers took an account of the slain, (Grot.) or the dedication of the statue was renewed, or rather the king’s nativity was kept. 2 B. 6:7. C.—But this would only occur once a-year. People were compelled to sacrifice on the same day of each month on which the statue had been dedicated. v. 62.  
**62** *Over-against*, or ( H.) “upon,” επι. The Greek altars were of a smaller size.  
**65** *Many.* Eleazar, and the seven Machabees, &c. C.  
**67** *Wrath.* God seemed displeased, as he was with too many. The pious were exposed to various trials, and to the fury of persecutors. H.—Read 2 B. 5:11. W.

## Chapter 2

**1** *Joarib* *.* This family was the most distinguished, as Josephus, who sprung from it, asserts, ( H.) being the first of the twenty-four families of priests. 1 Par. 24:7. 19. M.—Mathathias was probably a descendant of *Phinees*, (v. 54.) and was officiating when the impious orders arrived. Whereupon he retired to Modin, ( C.) near Diospolis. S. Jer.—Many say he was chosen high priest; and therefore decided the question about fighting on the sabbath. But any other, in similar emergencies, might have given that decision. C.—Judas was chosen, (Josephus) and Jonathas exercised the functions. Ant. xx. 8.—To verify the prediction of Jacob, some have concluded that the Machabees were allied to the tribe of Juda by the mother’s side. S. Jer. S. Aug. c. Faust. i. 72.—Yet this is not proved, nor requisite. They were called Asmoneans, either from the town of Asamon, (Jos. 15:27) or from Assamoneus, great grandfather of Mathathias. Jos. Ant. xii. 8.—This family ruled till Herod, 128 years. C.—Here an account is given of their wars, and more fully in the eight last chapters of the second Book. W.—Perhaps John, Mathathias, &c. were chosen high priests by the people, while the king sent others. Selden.  
**2** *Gaddis*, “a troop, fortunate, *or* a heap of wheat.” C.  
**3** *Thasi*, in Syr. “ardent,” or feeble, ( C.) or a destroyer. Pagn.  
**4** *Machabeus* *.* The common etymology has been given. H.—But Judas had then no banners, and there is no proof that the Jews used such abbreviations, ( C.) though moderns write *Rambam*, for “R. Moses, son of Maimon,” *Moce-bie*, ( H.) “conquering in God,” (equivalent to *Nicator*, the title of Sedeucus) seems better, particularly as the word is written *Machabee* *.* C.—Yet this is liable to the objection of *c* being placed instead of *k*, which occurs invariably in the Chal. and Syr. H.  
**5** *Abaron*, “passing,” *undaunted*, ( C.) or “potent.”—*Apphus*, “the wrath *or* flying of counsel,” (Pagn.) “fainting, abundant, *or* dissipating.” C.—This small help, of great importance, was foretold by Daniel, 11:34. W.  
**7** *Ruin.* S. Polycarp used a similar expression. Eus. v. 19.  
**14** *Lamentation.* By voluntary mortification, he sought to appease God’s indignation. M.  
**18** *They.* Josephus mentions Apelles. Persecutors have thus frequently attempted to delude the faithful; first by flattery, and then by torments.  
**21** *Profitable.* But quite the reverse both for this world and for the next. It is a dreadful crime.  
**22** *Way.* Gr. “to the right or to the left.” H.  
**24** *Law.* Deut. 11:6. M. and 13:9. Those who attempted to introduce the worship of idols, were to be slain without farther trial. C.—Mathathias was then judge and high priest. W.—He acted not though private revenge. S. Cyp. exhort. 5. S. Bern. ep. 158. W.  
**29** *And justice.* The ceremonial and moral law, ( C.) or to live piously. M.  
**34** *Sabbath.* By sacrificing to idols, or by coming forth to fight. H.—They were of opinion that the latter was unlawful, and their ignorance might be excused. M.  
**37** *Innocency.* Lit. “simplicity,” has often this sense. Their piety was not, however, enlightened, as the ceremonial law gives way on such occasions. C.—Their simplicity is commended by S. Ambrose, Of. i. 40. Yet they had not the prudence of serpents, which is also requisite. The Church remains. W.  
**41** *Come up.* They say not that they will attack. C.—Pompey perceived this, and made his advances and works on the sabbath, without opposition. Jos. Bel. i. 5.—Pompey I had thus taken Jerusalem. Jos. Ant. xii. 1.—The Samaritans will not more on that day. Ex. 16:29 ep. 2. ad Scaliger—The Jews now take care of the sick, but will not help a beast out of the ditch on the sabbath, though in our Saviour’s time they did just the reverse. Lu. 14:5. The law has thus been variously explained. The Machabees judged with prudence. Yet superstition had again gained ground, when Josephus (vita) would not fight of assemble his forces on the sabbath, as being contrary to the law. In a storm, a Jewish pilot abandoned the helm till the danger was evident. Synes. ep. iv.  
**42** *The Assideans.* A set of men that led a religious life; and were zealous for the law and worship of God. Ch.—They fought like the knights of Malta. A. Lapide—*Esidim* ( H.) means “the pious.” Eccli. 44:10. Many think they were the same with the Cinites, Rechabites, and Essenes. From them spring the Pharisees. C.—The society was intent on adorning the temple, (Scal.) by which they swore. Mat. 23:6. C.—They were like monks in the old law. Simon. M.—These Essenes followed piety, avoiding the hypocrisy and error of the Pharisees and Sadducees. W. Jos. Bel. ii. 12.  
**44** *Sinners.* Apostate Jews. C.  
**48** *Horn.* That is, they suffered not the power of Antiochus, that man of sin, to abolish the law and religion of God. Ch.  
**53** *Lord*, next to the king. Gen. 41:40.  
**54** *Everlasting*, as long as the old law should subsist. C.  
**55** *Jesus;* i.e. Josue. Ch.—He and Caleb alone gave a true relation. H.  
**57** *Mercy.* This virtue was characteristic. C.  
**66** *People.* Order is peculiarly requisite in all things, so here the proper persons are chosen, to whom each must submit in their sphere. W.—Mathathias speaks as chief of the nation. C.—Judas was his eldest son, and Simon the fourth. Jos. seder. &c.  
**70** *Year.* Not of his age, but of the Greeks, ( M.) after being at the head about twelve months. A. 3838. C.

## Chapter 3

**1** *Judas*, the eldest. Jos. Bel. i. 1.—His skill and valour also entitled him to this post. C.—He did not claim this honour, but received it from his father, and was obeyed by the virtuous people. W.  
**7** *Kings.* Epiphanes, Eupator, and Demetrius, with their generals. C.—Judas gained four great battles against Apollonius, Seron, Gorgias, and Lysias. C. 4:1, 28. W.  
**8** *Wrath* *.* Making the enemy retire, ( H.) and purifying the temple, &c.  
**9** *Perishing.* So the Jews style the miserable. C.—Go to 2 B. 8:1. W.  
**10** *Apollonius*, who had pillaged Jerusalem. 2 Mac. 5:24.  
**15** **Ve** **r.** **15** **.** *Wicked* apostates. C.—They are the most virulent. H.  
**16** *Bethoron*, seven leagues north of Jerusalem.  
**17** *Fasting.* Judas thus laudably prepared for battle. C.—Human frailty fears to engage a strong enemy. But true confidence in God gives courage and victory. W.  
**25** *Them.* Philip wrote from Jerusalem to Ptolemy, to send aid. He immediately despatched Nicanor and Gorgias, who doubted not of success, so that they brought the merchants to buy the Jews. 2 Mac. 8.  
**29** *Land.* He formerly received three hundred talents from Judea; now he was forced to send money thither. Sulp. ii. C.—*Times.* He not only disturbed the Jews, but other nations, which rebelled. W.—Though he had plundered the temple, he was still poor: the usual fate of wicked princes. M.—Sacrilege seldom prospers. When Henry VIII. took the revenues of monasteries, he was still needy. They had amply provided for the poor. Soon after, however, the poor rates commenced; and in the 39th Eliz. no less than eleven bills were brought into Parliament for their relief. Dugdale. See Hist. of Prot. Ch. H.  
**30** *Liberal.* Epiphanes left many vestiges of his magnificence. Vaillent.—The very year when Apollonius was defeated, (Usher, A. 3838. C.) he exhibited most costly games at Daphne, near Antioch, to excel those of P. Emilius, at Amphipolis. Yet he disgusted the company with his apeish conduct. Athen. v. 4.  
**31** **V** **er.** **31** **.** *Persia.* The Arab. (2 Mac. 7) says the king had revolted. C.  
**37** *Countries*, and took Artaxias, king of Armenia. S. Jer.  
**38** *Ptolomee.* He had been governor of Cyprus, under Philometor, and gave him the revenue only when he was capable of acting for himself. Polyb.—He afterwards betrayed the island to Epiphanes. 2 B. 8.  
**40** *Emmaus*, two leagues west of Jerusalem, ( C.) different from that mentioned in S. Luke. Reland.  
**41** *Servants.* Josephus (xii. 11.) adds “chains,” which were all turned against them by Judas. Nicanor had promised ninety Jews for a talent. 2 Mac. 8:10. C.  
**44** *Pray.* This, with fasting and other penitential works, is the best armour in holy wars of religion.  
**46** *Maspha* *.* Silo had been, and Jerusalem was afterwards, the place for public prayer. W.—As the Jews could not go to Jerusalem, they performed their duty as well as they could at Maspha, where Israel had often met. Judg. 20 and 21 and 1 K. 7:5 and 10:17.  
**48** *In which.* The Greek text seems corrupt. By a small change we might render, “while.” C.—From some passages abused, the pagans sought to establish their religion. Salien.—*For.* Many Greek copies add, “to inscribe,” ( M.) or “draw upon them the likenesses of their idols.” H.—Thus they wished to defile the books, as they had done the temple, ( M.) and render them useless to the Jews. H.—Syr. “law, before the sanctuary on account of the Gentiles, who wished to make them imitate their idolatry.” C.—The sacred books would be a good preservative. H.  
**49** *Ornaments*, which they had rescued from plunder. It seems they had also set up a sort of tabernacle, and had some ornament from the sanctuary.—*Days.* They ought then to offer victims, which was now impossible.  
**54** *Trumpets.* Protection seemed to be promised. Num. 10:9.  
**56** *Law.* Deut. 20:5. C.—Yet his forces were already few. H.  
**60** *Done.* This godly resolution inspired them with courage, and procured the victory. W.

## Chapter 4

**2** *Guides.* Several were apostates Judas was at or near Maspha. C.  
**3** *Rose up.* The vigilance of rulers and pastors preserves from the devil’s stratagems. W.  
**4** *Camp*, foraging, as they despised the forces of Judas, and supposed he was in the camp, or engaged with Gorgias.  
**6** *Three.* We find seven thousand elsewhere. He was at the head of three thousand, and set his three brothers over fifteen hundred each.—*Who.* Some copies read, “because.” He could arm no more completely.—*Swords.* This is added in Greek and in some Latin copies. Having already gained two victories, they must have had some *swords*, with which they slew the fugitives. v. 15. C.—They were ill armed, through poverty (Jos.) chiefly, ( H.) using slings. Zac. 9:15. C.—Confidence in God procureth his assistance, v. 8. W.  
**13** *Trumpet.* There were many priests in the army.  
**15** *Gezeron*, or Gazera, near Emmaus.—Idumea*.* Alex. MS. reads “Judea,” which seems more probable. The enemy fled on all sides, some among the Philistines; ( C.) others to the southern parts of Juda, occupied by Edom. H.  
**23** *Sea.* This sort of purple was most esteemed. The art of dying it is now lost. The merchants’ goods fell into the hands of the Jews. The pursuit was interrupted by the sabbath. At various times Bacchides and Timothy lost above 20,000; Phylarchus and Callisthenese perished; and Nicanor saved himself by flight. The booty was laid up in places of security. 2 B. 8:25. 30.  
**24** *For ever.* This was the chorus of Ps. 135 which was sung; ( C.) or the 117 might be used on this occasion. H.  
**27** *Commanded.* See what followed, 2 Mac. 8:8 to the end. W.  
**32** *Destruction.* Let them perish, or fall upon each other.  
**38** *Burnt* by Callisthenes, whom the Jews burnt in a house. 2 B. 8. C.—*Cham* *bers;* (*pastophoria* *.* Sept.) places for beds, veils, &c. H.—S. Jerom commonly prefers “the treasury,” with Aquila, or “beds,” as Sym. translates. Chambers for the officers of the temple were common both among pagans and Christians. Rufin, Hist. ii. 23. Com. Apost. ii. 57. Clem. pæd. iii. 2. C.—As it was the chief design of Judas to defend religion, so he presently purifies the temple. W.  
**41** *Fi* *ght*, or to be ready, if the garrison should offer to molest them ( C.) from the higher part of Sion, while they were performing what religion required of them. H.  
**42** *Blemish.* Legal uncleanness or immorality. C.  
**43** *Defiled.* Altars, temples, and statues of false gods made of stone, and set up in the temple, (C. 1:50. W.) and before the houses, (2 B. 10:1) were now demolished and thrown into the vale of Cedron. 2 Par. 29:16.  
**44** *Profaned* with impure victims, and with the altar of Jupiter erected above it. C. 1:23.  
**46** *Stones;* rough, and covered with brass: (Ex. 20:25) though this latter circumstances is not certain with respect to the altar built by the captives.—*Prophet.* None was recognized after Malachias, as God prepared his people to pay more attention to the Messias.  
**47** *Law.* Nothing was specified. The altar in the desert was of wood. At Sinai and Hebal, turf or rough stones were used; whence unhewed stones were judged most proper.  
**48** *Up*, or repaired the temple chambers, &c.  
**51** *Veils*, at the entrance of the holy of holies. C.  
**52** *Year.* The temple was purified a little more than two years after it had been profaned. A. 145. W.—The sacrifices had been interrupted just three years. The Second Book (10:3) specifies *two years;* whence some infer, that the temple was twice dedicated. But these two years most probably refer to the administration of Judas. S. Tho. or some other com. Usher, A. 3840. T. C. Salien. M.  
**57** Excutcheons, or bucklers of gold, taken from the soldiers of Antiochus. C. 6:39. Such ornaments were placed in temples, to testify the gratitude of the people. They wished to restore as much as possible when had been taken away. C. 1:23. On this occasion the Jews carried branches in memory of what they had suffered in desert places for three years. Hence they style it the feast of tabernacles of Casleu. 2 B. 1:9 and 10:6. C.  
**59** *Decreed.* Our Saviour observed this festival, which was appointed so long after Moses. John 10:22. W.—It was styled *Encœnia*, and kept in *winter* while Solomon’s temple was dedicated in Tisri, and Zorobabel’s in Adar. The Jews light lamps, ( C.) to testify their joy. Jos. Ant. xii. 11.—The Rabbins add, that a small bottle of oil had been preserved by the high priest, which multiplied so as to supply the lamps during the whole octave. Hence they still have lights at their windows on this festival. Seld. Syn. iii. 13.  
**61** *Bethsura*, which might receive reinforcements from Sion; or rather, ( C.) Gr. they “fortified Bethsura to keep it, (*Sion*) that,” &c. Grot. Vat.—Idumea*.* The people of that country had seized many cities of Juda. C.—Read 2 B. 10:1. W.

## Chapter 5

**1** *Nations.* They were always ready to oppress the Jews. Thus God punished or tried his people. C.—Judas, or his brethren, here gains eight victories over them. W.  
**3** Idumea*.* Alexandrian MS. has, “Judea.” Both may be right. The country had been wrested from Juda by the Idumeans.—*Acrabathane* is “the ascent of scorpions,” (hakrabim) which were probably numerous, to the south of the Dead Sea. Num. 34:4. Deut. 8:15.  
**4** *Bean* *;* perhaps Beon, near the sea of Sodom, ( C.) or Bathaner, beyond the Jordan. Serar.  
**5** *Destruction.* Sometimes the people were spared. All depended on the wording of the vow. Lev. 27:28. Num. 21:1. See other particulars, 2 B. 10:16 to 23. C.  
**8** *Gazer*, in Ephraim. But Jazer, in the tribe of Gad, seems to be meant, as the Greek expresses it. M.—*Towns.* Lit. “daughters,” or dependant ( H.) villages. W.—Afterwards Judas returned and defeated Timotheus. 2 B. 10:24.  
**9** *Galaad* *.* Most of the towns had been seized by the Ammonites, &c. After the return of the captives, they were probably driven out. They attempted to regain possession, when Epiphanes declared against the Jews.—*Datheman* *;* Petra, ( C.) or perhaps Rathma. Num. 33:18. Drus.  
**11** **Ver** **.** **11** **.** *Timotheus* *.* Another of this name had been slain the preceding year, 3840, at Gazara. 2 B. 10:37.  
**13** *Tubin*, or Tob, to the south of Gad. Judg. 11:3. C.  
**15** *Is filled.* Gr. Alex. “All Galilee of the Gentiles to destroy us.” H.—This part of Galilee was occupied by pagans, who were excited by Epiphanes to fall upon the Jews. 2 B. 6:8.  
**23** *Arbatis. Arboth* means “deserts” uncultivated, here probably denoting the valley of Jezrahel. Simon wisely concentrated the people, as Judas did in Galaad. v. 45.  
**24** *Desert;* probably from Bethsan to Bosor, marching with all secrecy.  
**25** Nabutheans; descendants of Ismael’s eldest son, whose capital was Petra. They continued friends to the Jews.  
**26** *Barasa* *;* probably the Bozra of Moab. Gr. “Bosorra.” Jos.—*Bosor* means a fortress. It is not wonderful that there should be many places of this name in Arabia, to defend the people from robbers.—*Alima;* Elim, or Almon. Is. 15:8.—*Casphor*, or rather *Casbon*, (v. 36.) the famous Hesebon. Num. 21:26. C.—*Mageth*, or Machati; (Grot.) though it seems too far off. Deut. 3:14.—*Carnaim*, “horns,” being sacred to the moon, ( C.) called Astaroth. Gen. 14:5. H.—Strabo styles it Carna.  
**29** *Fortress* of Datheman. v. 9.  
**36** *Bosor*, or Bosra. v. 26. Bosor was taken before. v. 28.  
**37** *After.* Judas had in the mean time defeated Lysias. 2 B. 11:1. &c. C.—*Raphon*, or Raphana; (Grot.) or as that was too remote, probably Saphon. Num. 32:35. C.  
**41** *Afraid.* He interpreted the delay in this sense, which was very precarious, ( H.) as nothing could be more superstitious. Jonathan begged for a similar proof of God’s favour. But Timotheus consulted only himself. 1 K. 14:9. C.  
**42** *Scribes;* tribunes, who kept a register of the soldiers. M.—They were officers of great power.  
**44** **4** **.** *Temple* of Atergata, or Astarte. Judas slew 55,000. Timotheus was spared. 2 B. 12:20. 26.  
**46** *Ephron*, beyond the Jordan. The situation is unknown. With regard to the right which Judas had to treat it with such severity, see Num. 20:18. Judg. 8:5. C.—It probably belonged to God’s people, and was unjustly detained. H.  
**52** *Plain*, extending beyond Jezrahel.  
**53** *Hindmost:* the place of danger. C.—A good general takes care of the weakest, and exhorts all to behave valiantly. W.  
**54** *Not one.* The 12,000 who defeated the Madianites, were preserved by God in like manner. Num. 31:49. H.  
**56** *And Azarias.* These two are known only for the disobedience and misconduct. In holy wars, God does not favour those who are actuated by base motives. v. 18. 60. C.—Men who depend on themselves, and who are not properly authorized, receive not assistance from above; so these failed, as they were not chosen like those who were to save Israel, ( W.) of the family of the Machabees. M.  
**58** *Jamnia*, a maritime city of the Philistines near Joppe. Gorgias, an experienced warrior, had retired thither. C. 4:5. and 2 B. 8:9. C.  
**62** *Israel.* The late Rev. Robert Bannister applied this to Protestant writers of sermons, to dissuade young divines from applying to such authors as Tillotson, &c. It may also shew the reason why heretics succeed so ill in their foreign missions. H.—They know how to pervert Catholics, not how to convert infidels. Tert.  
**63** *Men.* Gr. “man, Judas, and his brethren were,” &c. H.—See a similar expression Ex. 14:3 respecting Moses.  
**65** *Chebron*, or Hebron, which the Idumeans had seized. Judas retook it after he had defeated Gorgias. 2 B. 12:32.  
**66** *Aliens;* Philistines, v. 68.—*Samaria.* This seems too remote. Some substitute Saraia; (Jos. 15:35) others Maresa, (2 B. 12:35.) Marissa, (Jos.) the same as Ressa. Num. 33:21.  
**67** *Desiring.* They were only too brave. This quality was not incompatible with the priesthood. Gr. Alex. has, “while he (Judas) was desiring,” &c. Others have, “priests of the cities, while they,” &c. The Rom. edit. agrees with us, ( C.) and Grabe prints accordingly. H.

## Chapter 6

**1** *Higher*, beyond the Euphrates. C. 3:30. 37. C.—*The city.* Gr. Alex. &c. “a city in Elymais,” &c. The Rom. copy, Syr. Jos. style the place Elymais, where the temple was. C.—Profane authors agree that this temple was very rich, and that Epiphanes attempted to plunder it. S. Jer. in Dan. xi.—*Nanea.* Venus or Diana was the deity there adored, whom the king pretended he would marry. 2 Mac. 1:13 and 9:2. C.—The account of the death of Epiphanes is given to v. 16 and 2 B. 9. W.  
**4** *Battle.* it is not known whether Elymais belonged to the king. Strabo (xvi) observes it was very jealous of its liberty, which it maintained against the Persians and the successors of Alexander. C.—*Babylonia.* At last he returned toward the country of Babylon. But before he arrived, the news of his generals’ bad success in Judea filled him with vexation, and brought on desperate diseases. v. 8, and 2 B. 9:5. W.—He intended to pass by the country or city of Babylon, but was prevented by illness on the mountains which dived it from Persia.  
**5** *Persia*, at Ecbatana. He expired at Tabis, having fallen from his chariot, &c. 2 B. 9. C.  
**12** *Evils.* All this repentance was fictitious. 2 B. 9. W.  
**14** *Friends*, educated with him. He appointed him regent instead of Lysias. C.—His son Eupator was only nine years old. Appian.—He made him appear and be recognized by the army. Eupator means one “born of a good father.” C.  
**16** *Nine.* He began his persecution A. 143, so that it lasted six years and almost four months, or 2300 days, (Dan. 8:14) during which time Judas purified the temple, some months before the death of Epiphanes. W.  
**20** *Fifty.* How then was peace made in 148, as we read 2 B. 11:21.? Usher (3841) supposes the ear was reckoned according to the Chaldee custom, which defers is six months. Basnage (ii. 1.) rather thins that the letter is placed out of its proper order, and should occur at the beginning of Eupator’s reign. See 2 B. 10.—*Slings*, or to thrown stones, &c. *ballistas* *.* H.—The Gr. and Josephus rather indicate terraces, or towers where the machines were placed.  
**30** *Hundred.* The 2 B. 11:2 specifies 80,000. But it speaks of a subsequent action.  
**31** **Ve** **r.** **31** **.** Idumea*.* The passes on the north were probably occupied.—*Bethsura* lay to the south of Jerusalem. C.  
**32** *Bethzacharam*, a defile (Jos.) between the city and Bethsura. Judas abandoned the siege of the castle on Sion. C.  
**34** *Blood of grapes*, wine, (Deut. 32:14) and the juice of mulberries incite elephants to fight, as the smell of some sorts of blood causes dogs to hunt. Vales. Phil. lxxxii. W.—This might be done to accustom the elephants to the sight of blood. C.—White colours irritate them most, as red do bulls. Plut. de Fort. Alex.—Sometimes wine and spirits were given them to drink, when they were to trample on criminals: but it was only shewn them when going to battle, as by drinking they lose their strength. Elian, Hist. ii. 40. and xiii. 8. and 3 Mac. 5:30.  
**37** *Thir* *ty-two.* Bochart looks upon this and other such accounts as fabulous. He does not determine how many might fight in these towers; but allows that there must have been above two or three, as some would correct the Gr. text, “two or three strong men fighting with darts upon them.” An elephant has been known to carry above 5000 pounds, and thirty-two men would weigh no more than 4800. Pliny (viii. 7.) observes that sixty people have been seen upon an elephant. Eupator probably had his from India, where they are larger than in Africa. A person of that country was deemed fittest to manage them.  
**38** *Trumpets.* It would seem as if the infantry had none. Yet this does not appear probable. The Greek reads in a different manner. Some copies have “to stir up and enclose them in the defiles,” which seems useless; or “to keep them together in the phalanxes,” (MS. Alex. C.) as the Vulg. has read. M.  
**39** *Gold.* The Argyraspides of Alexander had “shields of silver.” His successors might surpass this magnificence; or the officers might have golden and the soldiers brazen bucklers.  
**42** *Six*, &c. before the exploit of Eleazer. Others fell afterwards. 2 B. 11:11 specifies 11,000 foot, and 600 horse. Josephus says 1000 of the van guard.  
**43** *Saura* *.* Gr. “Avaron,” ( C.) Alex. “the Sauaran.” H.—He is styled Abaron, (C. 2:5) the brother of Judas. C. Jos. Sa. M.—Arab. says “his servant.” This feat is attributed to Judas, (2 B. 13:15) as he was general, and approved of, or “commanded” Eleazer to act thus, according to Ben. Gorion, (iii. 20.) and the Arab.—*Harness*, for greater security. The skin is very hard, except under the belly. C.—Elephants in the army of Antiochus the great, or rather “the coward,” were richly adorned. Flor. ii. 8.—Porus, king of India, rode on one covered with gold. Curt. viii.  
**44** *Name.* This motive has made some condemn the exploit. But surely a person may seek to acquire fame, even by exposing himself to danger. Eleazar might well hope that the beast would not fall so suddenly. The other motive specified is truly noble and virtuous, and we cannot condemn this hero without stronger proofs. S. Gregory (Mor. xix. 13.) represents him as a figure of the proud: but he might not therefore be one of the number, ( C.) no more than Esau, who was a type of the reprobate. Mal. 1:3. H.—S. Ambrose (Off. i. 40.) highly commends the fortitude of this soldier exposing himself to the danger of death for a religion. W.—This is the general sentiment. See Serar. M. T. Grot. jure. iii. 4. a. 18.  
**46** *Under it.* The rhinoceros attacks the elephant in that most vulnerable part. Pliny 20.  
**47** *Them.* Judas thought proper to retire to the temple, which alone was fortified, and in his power. The citadel of Sion held for the king, and the city was defenceless. Only what lay to the north of Bethsura was then called Judea. The Idumeans occupied the rest. Eupator blockaded the temple, and besieged Bethsura, which he took. v. 51. This siege is related more at length. 2 B. 12:19. It cost the king a great deal. C.  
**51** *Battering slings.* Lit. *balistas* *.* H. See v. 20.—*Fire*, or the long javelin, *falarica*, mentioned by Livy xxi.  
**55** *King.* Lysias had thus been displaced. v. 14. C.—Providence permitted that he should seek his own interest, and thus deliver Judas from the most imminent danger.  
**58** *Come.* Lit. “give our right hands,” ( H.) the sign of the most inviolable engagements among the Persians. Jos. Ant. xvii. ult.  
**59** *Before*, by leave of Cyrus, Alex. &c.—*Despising.* Gr. “abolished.” They had made the attempt.  
**62** *Oath.* Eupator was not above ten years old, (v. 14. 20.) so that Lysias must bear the greatest blame. He seems to have prepossessed the king against Philip, the regent. H.  
**63** *City*, and slew Philip. Jos. Ant. xii. 15.) C.—Read 2 B. 13:1. W.

## Chapter 7

**1** *Rome.* He had been a hostage instead of Epiphanes, who usurped his throne. C. 1:11. After the death of the latter, the senate sent three legates to administer the kingdom, during the minority of Eupator. One of them was slain. The king and Lysias sent to exculpate themselves, but received no satisfactory answer. Demetrius thought this a proper opportunity for regaining the throne. He consulted the historian, Polybius, who advised him to depart privately. He, however, addressed the senate for leave, and being refused, fled with eight attendants to Tripoli, and thence to Apamea. His rivals durst not attack him, as he pretended to be sent by the Romans. The army of Eupator seized their king and Lysias, and put them to death. Polyb. cxiv. and cxxii. Jos. C.—Seleucus and Epiphanes were brothers; and of course Demetrius was cousin to Eupator, ( W.) and the lawful heir of Seleucus. H.  
**5** *Alcimus* *.* He occupied the place of Menalaus, and *would be* high priest, but that office was held by the Machabees. W.—Eupator had slain Menalaus, as being to turbulent. Onias IV. ought to have been recognized; ( C.) but he fled into Egypt, and there built a temple. Lysias advised the king to select one from a family of less power. Alcimus was such, though of the posterity of Aaron. v. 14. Jos. Ant. xii. 5. and xiii. 6. and xx. 8.—He had fallen under Epiphanes, and the Jews would not receive him.  
**6** *Thy friends*, and the apostates, who obeyed the decree of the king’s uncle. This was true, and the glory of Judas. See 2 B. 14:3. C.—They gained the king’s favour by presents, and falsely accused Judas and the people. W.  
**8** *River*, as governor of Mesopotamia, (Jos. Usher. C.) instead of Heraclides and Timarchus, who had abused their power. Hence Demetrius obtained the title of *Soter*, or “saviour.” Appian.—*Faithful.* The chief man under the king. H.  
**12** *Scribes.* They were both civil and military officers. C.  
**13** *Assideans* *.* These were first consulted, as being most learned and pious. C. 2:42. W.—They held no office. C.—Alcimus deceived them, and cruelly murdered 60, ( W.) some scribes.  
**17** *Them.* The Ps. 78 alludes to the Assideans, (v. 2.) and is explained by many, as relating to this massacre.  
**19** *Bethzecha* *.* Gr. “Beseth,” or Bethsetta, near the great plain. Hence Bacchides intended to return.  
**25** *Crimes.* He made the king some presents, of what he had probably stolen from the temple, and after waiting for some time in silence, began to accuse the people. 2 B. 14. C.—See what is there related to v. 12.  
**26** *Enemy.* He was one of the most terrible: yet Judas at last slew him. v. 43 and 2 Mac. 15:28. W.—Nicanor was high in the king’s favour, and had fled with him from Rome. Jos. Ant. xii. 17.—He first sent three ambassadors to Judas, in answer to what Simon had proposed; and peace was concluded. Alcimus hereupon accused Nicanor, and the king sent him an order to seize Judas. While he was endeavouring to comply, Judas escaped. He was again much exposed; (v. 29.) and therefore collected his army, and fought near Jerusalem. 2 B. 14:15. Usher, A. 3842. C.  
**31** *Capharsalama*, “the field of peace,” concluded perhaps with Eupator, (C. 6:62. H.) near Jerusalem.  
**32** *Thousand.* Some Gr. copies have “hundred.” Others think that these were Jews: but the contrary seems to be the case, though Judas was again (C. 6:47) forced to retreat to the temple, which he left shortly after. 2 B. 14:31.  
**33** *King.* The Jews observed the laudable custom of praying for their rulers, as Christians do. C. 12:11. Bar. 1:10 and 1 Tim. 2:1. C.—*Sacrificamus pro salute Imperatoris sed Deo nostro et ipsius* *.* Tert. ad Scap. ii.  
**34** *Abused.* Lit. “polluted them,” or grated their ears ( H.) with his “blasphemies.” Jos.—On such occasions, the Jews stopped their ears. Acts 7:56. C.  
**38** *Longer.* Read 2 B. 14:11. The last battle with Nicanor is described, C. 15. and here. v. 39. W.  
**40** *Adarsa*, in Ephraim, four miles from the lower Bethoron.  
**41** *Sennacherib.* Some copies omit this name.  
**45** *Gazara*, distant a day’s journey from Adarsa. v. 40. C. 5:8.—*Signals*, to admonish all. Gr. “with the trumpets for signals,” used for that purpose by the priests.  
**46** *Horns*, like bulls, ( C.) or they surrounded them with the wings of the army. Grot. Judith 15:6.  
**47** *Jerusalem*, and the temple, without the walls. His tongue was given to the birds. 2 B. 15:33. C.  
**49** *Thirteenth.* The day before the feast of *Purim*, ( H.) or “lots.” It was observed in the time of Josephus. C.  
**50** *Time.* While Judas settles religious matters, Demetrius prepares for war. Read 2 B. 15:1. W.  

---

## Chapter 8

**1** *Romans.* Many historians, Livy, Plutarch, &c. record the same. W.—*Things.* Gr. “people who join them.” H.—They comply with their just requests. M.—The Scripture speaks of the fine times of the republic and gives this temporal reward to the virtues of the Romans, which they so greatly sought, and to which alone they were entitled. C.—“Hitherto, says Florus, the Roman people were beautiful, noble, pious, holy, and magnificent.” The Jews, first among the eastern nations, employed their friendship to secure their liberty. *Facile tunc Romanis de alieno lagrientibus*, Just. xxxvi.  
**2** *They heard*, &c. What is here set down of the history and character of the ancient Romans, is not an assertion, or affirmation of the sacred writer; but only a relation of what Judas had heard of them. Ch.—Fame generally magnifies.—*Galatia*, over which Volso triumphed. Livy xxxviii. C.—The Gauls near Narbonne were then tributary to the Romans. Harduin.  
**3** *Mines*, for which Spain was most famous. Pliny iii. 3. Strabo iii.—*The place*, or every place in the world. M.  
**4** *Earth*, little known to the Jews, like Syphax, &c.  
**5** *Ceteans* *.* That is, the Macedonians. Ch.—Flaminius subdued the former, and P. Emilius the latter.  
**6** *Twenty.* Livy mentions only fifty-four. Florus allows that elephants were on both sides of the army, consisting of 300,000 foot. Appian admits but 70,000 men. C.—Polybius (5.) asserts that Antiochus had 102 elephants against Ptolemy. In this war he might well have 120. W.  
**7** *Alive.* He was forced to submit to conditions, as hard as if he had been prisoner. C.—He was present with the ambassabors at Lysimachia, to see the conditions put in execution. Polyd. xvii.—*Tribute.* He had to pay all the expenses of the war, 15,000 talents of Eubea, 350 to Eumenes, and 127 for wheat. Twenty hostages were required to be exchanged every three years.—*Upon.* Gr. “the division,” ( C.) or all Europe, and from Halys as far as Mount Taurus. All his elephants at Apamea, and his ships of war, were also ceded. Livy xxxviii.  
**8** *Indians.* So the Ionians and Carians might be styled, from the Indus or Kalbit, which flows through their country. The Midæi dwelt in those regions. Harduin.—Some think the Ionians and Mysians should be put for the Indians and Medes, (Grot.) as they were given up to Eumenes. Livy—Yet the name of Indian was very vague, and denoted the Ethiopians, Arabs, &c. C.—*Eumedes* *.* King of Pergamus. Ch.  
**9** *Greece*, in league with Antiochus, (Grot.) or the Etolians, whom Glabrio conquered, may be meant. Salien.  
**13** *Reigned*, like Masinissa, Prusias, Eumenes, Eupator, and Phiolmetor.  
**14** *Crown*, after the expulsion of the Tarquins.  
**15** *Twenty.* These latter were people in office, the two consuls, pretors, and questors, the four ediles, and ten tribunes. After Sylla the number of senators was augmented from 300 to 1000. Alex. Genial iv. 11. C.  
**16** *To one man.* There were two consuls; but one only ruled at one time, each in his day. Ch.—Of this we have an example in the battle of Cannæ. The first of the consuls wore the ornaments. Livy—It would have been more dreadful to have two than one ruler. W.—One of them governed at home; the other in the armies, and this latter alone was known to the Jews. They might also be falsely informed that a dictator was chosen every year. This was only done on great emergencies. C.—*No envy*, &c. So Judas had heard; and it was so far true, with regard to the ancient Romans: that as yet no envy or jealousy had divided them into such open factions and civil wars, as they afterwards experienced in the time of Marius and Sylla, &c. Ch.—Before they seemed all bent on promoting the public good. Sallust. Catiline.  
**21** *Sight.* The Romans expected they should soon be at war with Demetrius, and had heard of the exploits of Judas.  
**26** *Shall they.* The Jews and Romans shall pay their own forces. T. M.—Grotius explains it, as if the former were to give no aid to the enemies of Rome.  
**28** *To them.* Grotius adds, “to the enemies and to them,” &c. which is the sense of the Syr. and Arab. and the most natural.  
**31** *Jews.* He and his predecessors had abused their power. Yet Rupert and Peter of Blois (ep. 146.) disapprove of the Jews having recourse to the Romans: they might flee away. It is not lawful to take arms against the sovereign. God had, however, sufficiently evinced by miracles that the conduct of the Machabees was pleasing to him. 2 B. 15:12. C.—The Jews were not properly subjects, though tributary to foreign kings, whose design was to exterminate them. C. 3:39. Self-preservation dictated that they should call in the aid of others. H.—To die for religion was a great blessing. C.—But God would not have his people thus entirely destroyed. The obligations of rulers and of the people are reciprocal. All nations have asserted their right to seek redress under oppression. Yet few have been treated so ill as the Jews. Few have acted with equal zeal and justice. H.

## Chapter 9

**1** *Time.* About a year after Nicanor’s death, (C. 7:50. and 2 B. 15:38. W.) or in the same year, A. 3843; ( C.) so that the Romans had not time to send Judas assistance. H.—Josephus (xii. 17.) erroneously supposes that Alcimus was dead, and Judas his successor, while Simon was the civil ruler and general. He afterwards (B. xx. 8.) asserts that Jonathas was next high priest to Alcimus, who certainly officiated after the death of Judas. v. 54.—*Bacchides* had been already in Judea. C. 7:8. Now the *right wing*, composed of the best troops, and usually commanded by the prince when he was present, is entrusted to him.  
**2** *Galgal … in Arbella*, or the Galilee, in the flat country, *Araboth.* C. 5:23.—*Masaloth*, or Masal, was in the tribe of Asher. Jos. xvi. 30.—S. Jerom speaks of Arbela, nine miles from Legion. See Osee 10:14.  
**4** Berea, or Beroth, in Benjamin, not far from *Laisa*, or Lesen, (Jos. 18:25) where Judas was encamped, ( C.) with 3000 (Gorion); Josephus says 1000; Rufin translates 2000.  
**7** *Down.* The strongest are not free from the first emotions of trouble; but trusting in God, they are assured either of a temporal or eternal victory. W.  
**10** *Stain.* Lit. “bring a crime.” H.—He seems to have thought God required him now to fight, and he was convinced that he could save by means of a few, which excuses him from rashness. The Church adopts his words, (Dom. iii. Oct. Mat.) and S. Ambrose (Of. i. 41.) highly extols his bravery, in “preferring death before slavery and shame.”  
**12** *Legion.* So the Vulg. commonly renders Greek “phalanx,” ( C.) a compact body of 8000 men, used by the Macedonians. The Roman legion consisted of 6726, (Veget.) or 6666. The two phalanxes were in each wing supported by cavalry, which endeavoured to surround Judas.  
**15** Azotus. Not belonging to the Philistines, but some place unknown, which Josephus styles Asa.  
**18** *Slain.* Gorionides relates that the sight of Judas made Bacchides flee towards Azotus. He lost 15,000, when the rest of the army came upon Judas now fatigued; and as Bacchides returned to the charge, the hero fell upon heaps of the slain. Thus died this great man *who saved Israel.* v. 21. C.—*Gl* *oriosiorem triumphis mortem invenit* *.* The most mighty in the sight of men may fall; but the fortitude of Judas, proved by former heroic actions and by success, was now rendered perfect by this most glorious death. S. Amb. Of. i. 41. W.—Never was there a more accomplished and virtuous champion. He had all the qualities of a holy priest and a valiant soldier, as well as of a religious prince, always bent on promoting the glory of his people. C. 3:3. He was an admirable copy of Jesus Christ, the great original of all the saints. In the most dismal times he was chosen to save religion and the people. Almost alone, and wandering from place to place, he gains the most signal victories, forms a league with Gentiles, purifies the temple, acts both as high priest and as prince of the nation, and at last gives his life for his brethren. Thus Christ by his life and death unites all in one Church, and procures the remission of sin. C.  
**19** *Modin* *.* Their remains were seen there long after. Eus.—It is wonderful that they should be shewn at Antioch. S. Jer. loc.—But these were the relics of the seven brothers. 2 B. 7:1. C.  
**22** *Many.* Thus only some of our Saviour’s actions are recorded, for the same reason. John ult. H.  
**24** *All.* Josephus says, “Many.” We find some ( C.) joining Jonathan, v. 28. H.—When the people are without a ruler, they fall. Prov. 11:14. W.  
**26** *Abused them*, and “afterwards slew them all.” Jos. Ant. xiii. 1.  
**27** *No prophet* since the days of Malachi, ( C.) or the return from captivity. Jos.  
**28** *Jonathan*, or ( H.) Jonathas, was the third general captain of this family, and succeeded Judas in the pontificate, though Alcimus still usurped the dignity (C. 9:9) as in the lifetime of Judas. W.  
**33** *Thecua*, seven miles south of Bethlehem. S. Jer. pref. in Amos.—*Asphar*, or “asphaltite lake” (Gorion) of Sodom; so called on account of the bitumen, or asphalte. C.  
**34** *Sabbath*, out of contempt, like Nicanor; (2 B. 15) or thinking that the Jews would not then fight. M.  
**35** *Lend.* Some copies read, “to entrust unto them.” They wished not to be embarrasses with useless baggage. It all fell into the hands of Jambri, ( C.) who slew John. W.  
**37** *Madaba* *.* Gr. “Nadabath.” Jos. “Gabatha.” It seems, as the sons of Jamri lived at Madaba, the spouse would not be conducted out of that place, ( C.) unless they might reside sometimes in the country. H.—Chanaan, or “Arabia.” Jos.—Chanaan denotes any infidel. C.  
**42** *Revenge.* To punish faults with moderation and justice, is a virtue. Children and subjects are sometimes exposed to temporal chastisements, for the faults of their parents or leaders; yet this is for their own advancement in piety, or in punishment for the share they have had in the crime, or to prevent them from imitating it. S. Tho. ii. 2. q. 108. W.  
**44** *Before*, when we were in the desert of Thecua, and could decline fighting; ( M.) or, notwithstanding the sabbath, we must engage. C. 2:41.  
**48** *To them.* Jonathas swam to another place on the same side, otherwise there would have been no battle. W.—But this had taken place, when a thousand were slain; though Bacchides fled from Jonathan, v. 47. 49. H.—The Greek and Josephus seem more full: ( C.) “Swam over, and they (the enemies) did not cross the Jordan after them.” H.—Bacchides did not pursue the Jews. M.—Prot. marg. quotes Josephus, (xiii. 1.) who says two thousand were slain. H.  
**50** *Thopo*, or Taphua. The two last were in Ephraim.  
**53** *Castle*, on the highest part of Sion. v. 52. C. 1:35.—*Custody*, without doing them any farther injury. C.  
**54** *Alcimus* *.* Josephus (xii. 17.) confesses that Judas was high priest. But he mistakes when he says he succeeded Alcimus, who it hence appears survived him a year, (v. 3, 18.) and was only an usurper. He should therefore be corrected by this book, rather than it should be rejected because it differs from him, or any such authors. W. v. 1, 28. H.—*Walls*, before the most holy place, (Jos. Lyr.) or between the priests and people, (Salien. M.) or which separated the Jews from the Gentiles, as if to remove all distinction. Grot.—It is probable that he removed the wall which went round the inner temple and the altar of holocausts, ( C.) which Alexander restored. Jos. Ant. xiii. 21.—*Prophets.* Aggeus and Zac. had been as it were the architects and directors of the temple. C.  
**55** *House.* He could not make his will.  
**61** *He.* Jonathas slew those who had given information.  
**62** *Bethbessen*, in the desert of Jericho, ( M.) the same with Bethagla. Jos. “Bethalaga.”  
**66** *Odares*, people of the country who adhered to Bacchides.—*Increase*, or shew himself in the field with a large army, ( C.) or to penetrate the army of the enemy. Syr. Jos. Grot.  
**69** *Slew.* Evil counsel is prejudicial to the giver. W.  
**73** *Machmas* *.* The capital of Sion was still in the hands of the enemy. Jonathas made good use of the alliance with the Romans, and began to lay the foundations of the national independence, and to act like the ancient judges. C.

## Chapter 10

**1** *Illustrious.* He falsely asserted that he was the son of Epiphanes, being of very mean birth. Just. xxxv. W.—Others say that he was illegitimate, and styled Ballas after his mother Bala, though the name in Syriac may denote “a worthless person.” In his medals he styles himself *Deopator Euergetes*, as if “God were his father,” and himself “beneficent.” C. Usher, A. 3851.—At any rate the Romans and Egyptians acknowledged him, being glad to find a rival for Demetrius, who was become odious likewise to the Jews and Syrians. Heraclides had been deprived of his government ( C.) by the king, (C. 7:8) and in revenge ( H.) took Alexander, and Laodicea, daughter of Epiphanes, to Rome, where he gained over many of the senators, who agreed to help them to recover the kingdom. Heraclides then levied forces at Ephesus, and Ptolemais was delivered up to Alexander, whence he wrote to Jonathan. Nothing contributed more than these divisions to secure the liberty of the Jews.  
**3** *M* *agnify*, “extol,” or grant him fresh dignities. Soter wished to gain over Janathas, to prevent his rival from receiving supplies from Egypt. C.  
**8** *Fear.* The Syrians in the castle would fear, while the Jews would rejoice, and particularly the hostages. C. 9:53. H.  
**11** *Did.* The wall built by Judas had been demolished. C. 4:60. and 6:62.  
**18** *Brother;* the style used between kings, (3 K. 9:13) governors, (2 B. 11:1) and friends. C.  
**20** *Make.* The king could not make him high priest, as he was that already: but he acknowledged the title. W.—*Crown:* both the badges of kings, or granted by them. v. 62. Dan. 5:29.  
**21** *Vestment*, at the feast of *tabernacles*, A. 3852, seven years after the death of Alcimus, and nine since Judas fell. It is not clear from Josephus, (xiii. 5. and xx. 7.) whether the people chose him high priest, or they rather pressed him to accept the king’s offer. C.  
**23** *Prevented*, by sending presents. Demetrius had sent a letter and liberated the hostages, whom Jonathas might justly receive without declaring for the king. M.  
**25** *Jews.* He perhaps wished to set them at variance with *Jonathan*, to alone Alexander had addressed his letter. H.  
**26** **6** **.** *Heard.* He scruples not to tell a lie, for he had been informed of the contrary. v. 22. W.—“He prudently chose rather to appear to find them innocent, than to make them so,” (Grot.) by granting them pardon.  
**29** *Salt*, of which there were pits in the country. C. 11:35.—*Crowns.* Antiochus the great had before granted this exemption to the ministers of the temple. Jos. Ant. xii. 3. C.—The Jews, after its ruin, used to present such to their patriarchs. But the Roman emperors claimed them. Grot.  
**30** *Cities*, or cantons. Gr. “nomes,” specified C. 11:34.  
**31** *Free;* “an asylum” (Jos.) without any foreign troops, like Delphi. Grotius—Tyre was also “a sacred asylum.” Vaillant, A. 174.  
**32** *Castle.* Yet Jonathas was afterwards forced to besiege it. C.  
**33** *Cattle*, so that they shall not be forced to work for the public. Jos.  
**34** *Appointed* “of lots,” Judith, the dedication, &c. These days were privileged, that the people might go to the temple without being molested, and carry what they would free of all taxes.  
**36** *Let.* This is not required, but a proof of confidence. C.—*Great king.* He assumes the titles of the Persian monarchs. H.  
**37** *Trust*, to guard the king, (Jos.) or be in the treasury. T.—*Laws.* He revokes the impious edicts of Epiphanes.  
**39** *Ptolemais.* This was not a great present, as it was in the hands of his rival. But he wished the Jews to retake it.  
**41** *Above.* He was not in a condition to force the payment of these arrears, and is liberal of what he does not possess. C.  
**42** *They:* former kings. H.—Bagoses exacted fifty drachmas for every lamb, before the daily sacrifice could be offered. Jos. Ant. xi. 7.  
**43** *Free.* Their persons and goods are protected in this asylum. Even the king’s debtors are not excluded. C.  
**46** *No credit.* Thus would all prudent people judge. W.—Alexander had moreover made the first offers, and was supported by the Romans. The Jews had not to examine his title, which was admitted by many in Syria.  
**50** *Day.* A. 3853. C.—The left wing proved stronger. But the right, where Demetrius fought in person, was forced to yield; and the king plunging with horse into a bog, was pierced with arrows, fighting bravely. He had reigned twelve years, and fell a victim to the surrounding kings, whom he had not conciliated. Jos. Just. xxxv. &c.  
**51** *Ptolemee*, surnamed Philometor, ( Ch.) by whose aid Alexander had obtained the victory. C.—This Philometor decided in favour of the Jews against the Samaritans, because the succession of priests was preserved among the former. Jos. Ant. xiii. 6.—Our Saviour also judged their cause preferable. John 4:22. W.  
**61** *Pestilent.* So the impious are styled. Ps. 1:1. &c. C.  
**64** *Away.* When calumniators see the innocent honoured, they are afraid to persecute them. W.  
**65** *Dominion* *.* General of his armies, (Vat.) or in Judea. Sacy. M.  
**67** *Son.* The king had sent his two sons, this Nicator and Sidetes, to Cnidus, that they might be out of danger. The eldest being informed that Alexander had given himself up to debauchery, put himself at the head of an army which Lasthenes of Crete had raised.  
**69** *Apollonius*, who had deserted Alexander, A. 3856, though appointed governor of Cœlosyria by him.  
**70** *Mountains.* I seem to be fighting with them. Come out, and shew your valour.  
**72** *Twice.* He alludes perhaps to the defeat of Azarias, and to that where Judas was slain. C.—This captain had also twice thought proper to retreat. C. 6:47. and 7:32. H.  
**77** *Army.* Josephus says eight thousand foot, &c.  
**80** *Army.* Lit. “camp,” which the Vulg. puts for an army chiefly of foot. Josephus intimates that Jonathas drew up his forces in the shape “of a tile,” or phalanx, and ordered them to face about on every side. C.—Thus the enemy could only throw darts, but could not penetrate. W.  
**81** *Fatigued.* In the evening, Simon seeing the enemy’s cavalry tired, fell upon the infantry.  
**83** *And. Et qui* seems to be mistaken for *equi*, “the horsemen,” as the Gr. Syr. and Jos. read.—*Bethdagon*, “the house of Dagon.”—*Temple.* This is the sense of the Greek. C.—Vulg. has literally, “their idols.” See Judg. 16:23. H.  
**89** *Buckle*, to be worn on the shoulder. S. Isid.—This honour was very extraordinary. 2 B. 11:35. Alex. Genial. ii. 29.—*Blood.* Lit. “relations of kings.” H.—The highest officers of the court of Persia bore this title. C. 11:31. Est. 16:11. Xen. Cyr. viii.

## Chapter 11

**1** *Shore.* By this hyperbole, used in Scripture, we are given to understand that the army was greater than could be easily numbered or conceived. W.—Philometor had assisted Alexander, with a treacherous design of seizing the kingdom when it should be weakened. H.—He had given him his daughter for the same purpose; and now, when Demetrius asserted his claims, he pretended that he would defend his son-in-law, and was thus admitted into all the towns. At Ptolemais he declared his real design, still pretending that Alexander had laid snares for him. While the latter was raising forces in Cilicia, he took Antioch, where he placed two diadems on his head; slew the cruel Ammonius, who had chiefly irritated the people against his master; gave the wife of Alexander to Demetrius; and, in conjunction with him, went to attack Alexander near the river Œnoparas. Here he received some mortal wounds; though Alexander was routed, and soon after slain in Arabia. Livy lii. Usher, A. 3859.  
**4** *Way.* This was done to irritate him against Jonathas, but he had now something else to do.  
**7** *Eleutherus*, about eighty leagues. Some place this river between Tyre and Sidon, but it ran to the north of Libanus. C. 12:24. Pliny, &c.  
**8** *Seleucia.* Lit. “of the cities to Seleucia, on the sea shore,” ( H.) at the mouth of the Orontes, ( C.) or Belus. Ptolemy.  
**9** *Hath.* To what measure will not ambition stoop! These kings made light of adultery; and Cleopatra was still more dissolute, and married a third. H.  
**10** *Kill me.* Josephus thinks this was true: but it seems only a pretext.  
**13** *Antioch.* The whole province rebelled on account of the cruelties of Ammonius, who put on women’s clothes, but could not escape. Philometor was proclaimed king, yet besought the people to forget the injuries of Soter, and receive his son, as for his part he was content with Egypt. Just. xxxv. Jos. C.—Perhaps he saw that the time was not come for his annexing Syria to his dominions, though that was his real and primary intention. H.  
**14** *Places* of Syria, ( C.) and the parts adjoining to Cilicia, ( H.) which always continued faithful. C.  
**17** Zabdiel, “God’s dowry,” or Diocles, “the glory of God,” ( H.) prince of Arabia. Diod. xxxii.—Only five accompanied Alexander. His generals sought to make their peace with his rival, and slew him. Usher.—*Exalted.* Alas! to become the victim of death in the space of a week! H.  
**18** *After.* He had been mortally wounded in the battle, and remained insensible four days. When the head of Alexander was brought, he came to himself; but died three days after, while the physicians were trepanning him.—*Camp.* The Egyptians loudly complained of this ingratitude of Demetrius. Jos. C.—Perhaps he saw through the perfidy of Philometor, who had designed to keep the kingdom. H.  
**20** *Castle.* Soter’s offers had not been accepted. C. 10:22. Jonathan thought himself independent of his son. C.  
**21** *Nations*, by their actions. They wished to be free from the restraint of the law. H.—When pastors seek to extirpate sin, the wicked represented this to princes as dangerous to the state. W.  
**23** *Priests.* These would testify that what he said in his defence was true. M.—Zealous men will not cease to repress wickedness, as *God’s word is not tied.* 2 Tim. 2. W.  
**27** *Friends.* Gr. “he set him at the head of his first friends,” ( H.) treating him with the greatest distinction. C.—Wise kings will always esteem zealous ministers, knowing that their fidelity to God is an assurance that they will also be faithful to their sovereign. W.  
**28** *Governments*, (*toparchias*) or “principalities.” These had already been given, and are now enriched with immunities, like the rest of Judea and Samaria. W.—The latter was not one of the governments, but they were taken from the country and from Galilee. Jonathas redeems all taxes.  
**31** *Parent.* Lasthenes had procured his troops, and was made prime minister. But abusing his power, threw his master into many difficulties. C.  
**34** Apherema. This city is specified in Gr. H.—Syriac styles it Aphrem: probably a town of Ephraim; (John 11:54) perhaps Ephra, where Gedeon was born. Judg. 6:11.—*Lyda*, or Dospolis. C.  
**35** *Of them.* He remits only the arrears, (Grot.) or all future claims, which are given up to the priests. H.—*Pans*, or “lakes.” Some would substitute ( C.) τιμας, “dues,” but without necessity. H.—The lake of Sodom furnished salt of a sharper and more digestive nature than the other. Galien iv. 19. See C. 10:29.  
**38** *Nations*, particularly Crete. This most pernicious counsel was probably given by Lasthenes. C.—All people dislike foreigners to be trusted more than natural born subjects. H.  
**39** *Tryphon*, styled Diodotus before he mounted the throne. C.  
**46** **Ver** **.** **46** **.** *Fight.* The king attempted to disarm the citizens of Antioch; but they revolted, and would have slain him in his palace, (Diod. Valesii.) had not the Jews in the country, and those sent by Jonathas, come to his aid. He did not, however, give them a suitable reward. C.—Three thousand faithful slew 100,000 infidels; ( W.) or the were joined by others who were already in the king’s army, ( H.) or in the neighbourhood, ( C.) as well as by the rest of the foreign troops, though the Jews were the most active and numerous. H.  
**54** *Diadem*, A. 3860. C.—He took the title of *Theos Epiphanes*, “God appearing;” and that of *Nicephorus*, “the victorious,” when he took Antioch. Diod. Excerp. Vales, p. 346. Vaillant  
**56** *Elephants.* Lit. “beasts;” θηρια. H.  
**57** *Four.* The three specified, (v. 34.) and probably Ptolemais. C. 10:39.  
**58** *In gold.* Kings alone had or granted this privilege, ( C.) as well as to wear purple or a chain of gold, ( W.) or buckle. C. 10:89. H.  
**59** *Tyre.* Eupator had given only as far as Ptolemais. 2 B. 13:24. This Antiochus gave the two brothers, the highest marks of esteem, making them governors of Phenicia and of Palestine.  
**60** *River* Jordan. He was then joined by the Syrian forces, and established the power of Antiochus as far as Damascus. Then he proceeded by the sea shore, and took Gaza. C.  
**62** *Hand*, or made peace by this usual ceremony.  
**63** *Treacherously* is not specified in Greek.—*Cades*, a strong city in Galilee.  
**67** *Asor*, near lake Semechon. Jos. 11:1. Gr. “Nasor,” erroneously. C.—The *n* is superfluous. H.  
**70** *Army.* Gr. “captains of the army of the forces.” H.—Only these two *captains* remained; but there were some soldiers. Josephus says about fifty. Three men would hardly have made a fresh attack. v. 72. W.—Yet feats equally incredible have been performed by Samson and by some of the Romans. H.—The little band of fifty-three entirely defeated the enemy. C.—The two captains and their men alone stood firm.  
**72** *Fought.* Gr. “fled.” M.—Three thousand. Josephus says two thousand were slain. Ant. xiii. 9. C.

## Chapter 12

**1** *Served*, Syria being so much divided. Hence Jonathas went to the two most famous republics of the world, and probably to the Jews beyond the Euphrates, to the Nabutheans, &c. v. 2. C.  
**2** *Spartans.* The city was also called Lacedemon and Theramne. W.  
**6** *People.* The Jewish state then greatly resembled those of Rome and of Sparta. The high priest and senate ruled, yet not without the participation of the people.—*Brethren*, proceeding from the same stock. This was the received opinion in both countries, though without foundation, that we can discover. C. Diss.—The proofs might be known to those who were more concerned. H.—The Spartans, whom Josephus, &c. style Lacedemonians, sprung from Abraham, (v. 21.) and were long ago in league with the Jews. W.  
**7** *Onias* the third, between the years 3805 and 3829.—*Arius* *.* Gr. and Syr. erroneously write, Darius. See v. 20. Jos. Ant. xii. 5.  
**9** *Things;* the letters of Arius, as the sacred books testified the same. Gr. Jos. Grot.—This sense appears to be the most natural; or we are not interested in make the present application.  
**11** *Observances.* Gr. Syr. “supplications.” The Vulg. had probably at first, *obsec* *rationibus* *.* The Jews prayed for their allies, &c. to beg for their temporal prosperity, and for their conversion. C. 7:33.  
**13** *Kings.* Ever since the time of Onias, wars had been waged against Epiphanes, Eupator, Soter, and Nicator. C.  
**19** *Letter.* Arius wrote before Onias, though the letter be placed later. W.—Josephus give it rather in different words. The answer to Jonathan was sent to Simon, A. 3861. C. 14:22. C.  
**21** *Spartans.* They had probably some old genealogies. Jos. xii. 5. and xiii. 9. W.—Yet they might not be true. Few nations can ascertain their origin; and most run into fabulous accounts, if we except the Jews. C. See v. 6. H. Salien, A. 3821.—There is nothing certain. Rep. Heb. 1:2. M.  
**23** *Back.* It would hence appear that the Jews wrote first which does not seem to be the case from Josephus, &c. C.  
**24** Demetrius. He resided at Laodicea, feasting, (Diod.) while his generals attempted to detach Jonathas from Antiochus, but without success. They fled at his approach beyond the river Eleutherus, from which Laodicea was not remote. C.  
**29** *Burning.* They had been left to conceal the flight. M.—Grabe supplies, “and they departed,” at the end of v. 28. H.  
**31** Zabadeans. No nation of this name is known; whence most people read “Nabatheans,” after Josephus. They had been allies of the Jews, but perhaps took part with Demetrius. C.  
**33** *Of* *it*, as it was designing to revolt. Jonathas had possession before. C. 10:73. M.  
**36** *Mount.* Lit. “height,” ( H.) or wall, to prevent the garrison from receiving supplies. C.  
**37** *For.* Gr. “he approached,” which Grabe substitutes instead of “was fallen *down.*” H.  
**38** *Adiada*, or Addus, (C. 13:13) in the plain west of the mountains of Juda. C.  
**39** *Tryphon.* In a moral sense, Tryphon represents the practice of the devil, who seeks first to deceive pastors. For, as S. Gregory (hom. xxxviii.) teaches, if the pastor’s life be corrupt, his doctrine will be contemned. W.  
**40** *Bathsa* *n*, or Scythopolis, below the lake of Genesareth. Tryphon was not content with governing under the young Antiochus. He was afraid lest Jonathas should oppose his measures, ( C.) knowing that he was a man of probity, to whom the king had shewn favour.  
**49** *Plain* of Esdrelon, or Mageddo, ( M.) styled also the vale of Jezrahel, and perhaps Arboth. C. 5:23. and 9:2.  
**50** *Slain.* So it was reported, though falsely. C.

## Chapter 13

**1** *Simon*, the fourth high priest and prince of his family, who was judged by his father to be the most prudent. C. 2:65. He endeavoured to defend the nation. W.  
**11** *Jonathan*, his friend, (Jos.) brother of Mathathias, mentioned C. 11:70.  
**12** *Custody:* tied to a soldier, like S. Paul. Acts 18:16.  
**13** *Plain;* Sephala, (C. 12:38) above Eleutheropolis, by which road Jerusalem wa most easily attacked. C. 6:31. C.  
**19** *Talents.* If he had refused, he might have been suspected of avarice or of ambition. M.—Jonathan would most probably have been slain, and the people would have revolted. S. Tho. W.  
**20** *Ador*, called Adoraim, (2 Par. 2:9) near Marissa; or perhaps Eder, a southern city of Juda, may be meant. Tryphon attempted in vain to cross the mountains. C.  
**22** *But.* Gr. “and that very night there was very much snow; and he came not on account of the snow; and he rose, and went into,” &c. H.—He gave this out, or intended to go, but went back along the Jordan.  
**23** *Bascama;* perhaps Besech. 1 K. 11:8. C.  
**28** *Pyramids.* In such the kings of Egypt were buried. Lucan viii. 998.—Simon enclosed the pyramids with porticoes, supported by pillars all of one piece of marble. Josephus and S. Jerom saw the sepulchres. C.—One was probably designed by Simon for himself. H.  
**29** *Arms*, to denote their victories or solicitude for the people’s welfare both by sea and land. The Machabees had repaired the port of Joppe, by which they traded with the Mediterranean. C. 10:75. and 14:5. Trophies of arms, in reality or in sculpture, were commonly placed on the tombs of great generals. Ezec. 32:27. Virg. C.—Simon promoted not vain but true glory, exciting others to imitate the virtuous. W.—The humble desire honour in God; proud men will be honoured more than God. S. Aug. c. Secund. xvii.—How many epitaphs record the ambition and vices of men! Those which praise real virtues extend the glory of God, who is the author of them all. W.  
**31** *Sle* *w him.* He hired surgeons to cut him, pretending it was for the stone. Epit. Liv. lv. Just. xxxvi.—Antiochus was only ten years old. A. 3861.  
**32** *Crown.* The soldiers declared for him, in hopes of great rewards which he had promised. He assumed the name of *Tryphon*, “wearing a helmet,” or “addicted to pleasure.” His medals have always a helmet; and the tyrant styles himself, ( C.) “king Tryphon, the autocrat,” ( H.) or generalissimo. He sent a golden statue of victory to Rome, but the senate inscribed the name of the young Antiochus upon it. The first conquest of Tryphon was Apamea, where he was born.  
**34** Demetrius, who still possessed a great part of Syria. Jonathas adhered to his competitor. But Simon preferred him before Tryphon, on condition that he granted the immunities which Soter had promised. C. 10:29.  
**37** *Palm; bahem*, “a precious chain.” W.—Gr. **bainen**, which Grotius thinks is derived from *bais*, a palm branch. C. John 12:13.—It was probably of gold, ( M.) like that offered by Alcimus. 2 B. 14:4. Some suppose that a collar or garment, adorned with gold and representations of palm branches, may be meant; such as that which was presented by the Romans to Masinissa. Livy iii. B. x.—Syriac translates, “a robe.”  
**38** *Force.* He grants all Simon’s requests, which he had offered to do at the beginning of his reign. C. 11:37.  
**39** *Oversight.* All sins in some sense proceed from ignorance.  
**41** *Israel*, A. 3861, B.C. 143. C.—Thus, after a hard struggle, the independence of the Jews was acknowledged. H.  
**42** *Public.* Gr. “contracts.” M.—This became a new era. H.  
**43** *Gaza.* It had revolted. C. 11:61.—*Engines.* Gr. ελεπο λεις, denoting engines of a great size, invented by Demetrius at the siege of Rhodes, who was thence styled “the city taker.” C.—Its top was covered with mortar, (Marcellin xxiii. 9.) and the sides with raw hides and iron bars, so that fire or stones made no impression upon it, while people within moved it to batter the walls by means of wheels. When a breach was made, they jumped *into the city*, v. 44. See Vitruv. x. 22.  
**47** *Idols*, of a domestic kind. The city had been assigned to Juda, and must be purified. Jos. 15:47. Deut. 7:25. C.—Mercy is most pleasing to God and men, provided justice and religion be not injured. W.  
**48** *Habitation* sometimes, to guard against Egypt.  
**50** *Castle.* It had been occupied by the Syrians, from A. 3836 to 3861.  
**52** *Days;* the octave, or the 23rd of the second month, annually. H.—This was like one of the days *appointed.* C. 10:34. The festival was observed perhaps only during his reign. Josephus takes no notice of it: but informs us ( C.) that Simon reflecting on the miseries inflicted on the city by this castle, and fearing lest it should fall again into the hands of the enemy, advised the people to level it to the ground; which they did in the space of three years. Ant. xiii. 11. They did not commence immediately, as Sidetes reclaimed it three years hence. C.  
**53** *Fortified.* This work employed them six years. Jos.  
**54** *John.* Hyrcan, who defended the country, (C. 16. W.) and succeeded Simon.—*Gazara* *;* perhaps Gadara, ( C.) which the Jews seized, (Strabo xvi.) or Gaza. M.

## Chapter 14

**1** *Two.* It is not easy to conceive why Josephus and Grotius place this expedition before the death of young Antiochus. C. 13:31. 41. Demetrius was become contemptible, and had a mine to regain his reputation by attacking the Parthians, who had taken many provinces under the prudent conduct of Mithridates. The Greeks were impatient of this yoke. Many []ked to Demetrius, and he gained several victories; but after two years, was perfidiously taken by a general of the Parthians while treating of peace. Mithridates took him for a warning through the places which seemed favourable to him; but afterwards he sent him into Hyrcania, gave him his daughter in marriage, with the badges of royalty, and promises of restoring him to his kingdom.—*Tryphon.* After the misfortune of Demetrius, he abandoned himself to his pleasures; and his adherents put themselves under Cleopatra, the wife of his rival, who resided at Seleucia, upon the Orontes. Usher, A. 3863. Just. xxxvi. and xxxviii. C.  
**2** *Arsaces* *.* This was the common title of the Parthians kings, after the founder of that powerful monarchy. Just. xli.  
**4** *Days.* Few princes have obtained such a character: for how shall they give content to all? C.—Simon had governed two years in troubles, but henceforward enjoyed peace, till Sidetes disturbed it. W.  
**5** *Sea*, or to all places which they went by water. The port was however very indifferent.  
**7** *Captives*, taken from the enemy; ( C.) or he liberated many Jews. W.—*Gazara*, or Gadara. C.  
**9** *Land.* The judges ( H.) strove to promote peace.—*Robes.* Spoils which they had taken; ( C.) or they were ever ready to defend the country, though peace now prevailed.  
**10** *Ammunition:* provisions and engines of war. C.—*Earth:* Judea and the environs. H.  
**12** *Fig-tr* *ee:* a picture of perfect peace. 3 K. 4:25.  
**20** **. Princes.** Cleomenes, the last king, died in Egypt, A. 3784, and the tyrant Nabis perished long before this time. Grot.—*Cities.* Many depended on Sparta, the metropolis. W.  
**23** *Public.* Lit. “in the distinct books of the people.” Gr. “open for inspection;” αποδεδειγμενοις. H.—Patentibus seu *publicis* *.* Vat.—The substance of the letter is here given.  
**24** *Of Rome* is not in Gr. or Syr. and it is allowed that the sequel seems rather to express the gratitude of the Jews to Simon. C.—When peace was established, and friendship with the Romans and Lacedemonians renewed, the whole nation in gratitude to Simon, who now remained alone of all the sons of Mathathias, confirm him in the office of high priest *for ever*, or during his life; and decree that his progeny shall enjoy the same. v. 41. 49. W.—They should not be deposed, like Onias III. &c.  
**26** *He.* Gr. “He has established: (Syr. “acted valiantly.” C.) He, his brethren, and his father’s house, and they have routed the,” &c. as C. 16:2. H.  
**27** *Elul*, the last of the civil year, A. 3863.—*At.* Lit. “in Asaramel,” ( H.) “the court of Mello,” ( C.) or “the prince of God,” (Serar.) as if it were another Hebrew title of Simon. Prot. “At Saramel.” Marg. “or Jerusalem, peradventure, … or the common hall,” &c. H.  
**34** *Gazara*, or Gadara. C. 13:51.—*Reparation.* Lit. “correction.” H.—But *correctionem* would agree better with the Gr. than *correptionem* *.*  
**36** *Purify*, (*castitati* *.*) Syr. “the sanctuary.” Grot. divine “worship.”  
**39** *Things.* Gr. joins this with the preceding verse. Some copies have, “all things.” He confirmed him in all his rights.  
**41** *Prophet.* This limitation was proper, as the people had chosen this family. The Jews expected the faithful prophet shortly. C. 4:46. Mal. 3:1. Agg. 2:7. God was pleased that none should appear for some time before that event. C.—The high priesthood continued in this family till Herod began to sell it,—soon after which Christ appeared. W.—The sceptre seemed to belong to Juda. Yet they consent to be governed by Levites, till God signify his will by some prophet. M.—This consent of the nation, in which Juda was most powerful, shews that the sceptre was not departed from his thigh. H.

## Chapter 15

**1** Demetrius. Soter, and brother of Nicator, ( C.) now a captive. W.—When the latter went beyond the Euphrates, he wandered for fear of Tryphon, till he found rest at Rhodes, where he heard of his brother’s misfortune, and was invited by his wife to marry her. He therefore took the title of *king*, when he wrote to Simon from the *isle* of Rhodes. Soon after he landed ( C.) at Seleucia, and married Cleopatra, who was indignant that her husband had taken to wife the daughter of Mithridates. Just. xxxvi.—Tryphon’s adherents flocked to him: *exolescente favore recentis imperii* *.* Trog. xxxix. Eusebius—Demetrius was styled Sidetes, either because he came from Side, in Pamphylia, or because he was fond of “hunting.” Yet his medals have, “Euergetes.” Vaillant, Usher, A. 3864. C.—*Princ* *e.* Gr. “Ethnarch.” H.—Josephus often uses this title for an independent prince, beneath the dignity of a king. C.  
**2** *And to.* Gr. properly adds, “and Ethnarch, and to,” &c.  
**3** *Pestilent;* disturbers of the peace, ( H.) like Alexander, Antiochus, and Tryphon.  
**5** *Oblations*, such as were presented to the Lord, or remittances. He is very liberal of what he could not get back.  
**6** *Money* *.* He supposed that Simon would have his own image on it. But we find no human figure on the coins which he sent out during the first four years, but only vessels, trees, inscriptions, &c. Afterwards he seems to had desisted, either (as some suppose) because it was not conformable to the law, or because he found it brought no profit to the state.  
**11** *Dora*, to the south of Carmel Tryphon had first tried the fortune of a battle. C.  
**15** *Numenius.* He had been sent to Rome almost two years before, and now brought letters not only to the Jews, but to various kings and nations on their behalf. W.  
**16** **. Lucius,** Calvus, or Philus, (Drus. Grot.) or Piso, (Usher. Sal. M.) whose colleague Lenas, went against Numantia. C.—*Ptolemee*, surnamed Physcon, brother and successor of Philometor, ( Ch.) in Egypt. H.  
**22** *Attalus*, &c. Attalus was king of Pergamus, Ariarethes was king of Cappadocia, and Arsaces was king of the Parthians. Ch.—Demetrius was prisoner of the latter.  
**23** *Lampsacu* *s*, in Mysia, a free city.—*Delus*, an island of great trade after the fall of Carthage.—*Myndus*, a port in Caria.—*Sicyon*, another in Achaia.—Samus, and independent and powerful island near Asia Minor.—*Pa* *mphylia*, in Cilicia, beyond Taurus.—*Lycia* had been freed from the Rhodians, by the Romans.—Alicarnassus, an ancient town of Caria, opposite to the isle of *Coo* *.*—*Side*, in Pamphylia. v. 1. Grotius conjectures we should read, “Sidon.”—Aradus, near the coasts of Syria.—*Rhodes*, famous for its Colossus.—*Phaselis*, a maritime town near Lycia.—*Gortyna*, a city of Crete, which was then an independent island.—*Gnidus*, an island near Rhodes.—*Cyrene*, a province of Egypt. It must hen have been partly free, and in alliance with Rome.  
**24** *Simon*, that he might know what they had done for him, and to whom he might apply for aid.  
**25** *Second.* He had interrupted the siege, or made a fresh wall or attack.  
**27** *Not.* Josephus seems to assert the contrary; observing that the king applied for aid, which was readily granted. Yet he soon forgot the favour, and sent Cendebeus against the Jews. He passed over the embassy of Athenobius. v. 28.  
**28** *Gazara* *.* The edit. of Basle properly reads, “Gadara.”  
**30** *Taken*, such as Joppe, the three governments, &c. C.  
**35** *Talents.* Simon subdued these two towns, because they attacked his country; but as they did not otherwise belong to him, he paid ( W.) or offered to pay something for them. H.—Those of Joppe drowned two hundred Jews. 2 B. 12. What Gazara had done we know not. W.  
**37** *Orthosias*, in Phœnicia, opposite to Aradus. Hence he fled to Apamea, ( C.) strewing silver in the way to stop his pursuers. Front. ii. 13.—The city was however besieged, and he slew himself, (Strabo xiv.) or was slain after a reign of five years. Jos. Vaillant.  
**38** *Coast.* This government was granted to Simon by young Antiochus. C. 11:59.  
**39** *Gedor*, near Jamnia. Gr. “Cedron,” ( C.) as also v. 40 formerly ( H.) in the Vulg. A city was here repaired on the river Cedron. W.—Syr. “Hebron.”—*Fortify.* Lit. “to block up.” H.—But this is the import of the Greek. C.—Alex. MS. “to fortify cities.” H.—*Gates*, or defiles. Grot.

## Chapter 16

**1** *John.* He was afterwards surnamed Hircanus, and succeeded his father in both his dignities of high priest and prince. He conquered the Edomites, and obliged them to a conformity with the Jews in religion; and destroyed the schismatical temple of the Samaritans. Ch.—He was the eldest son and successor of Simon. W.—*Gazara*, the same with Gaza, ( M.) or Gadara, where John resided. He came to announce the ravages of the enemy.  
**3** *Be you.* Gr. and Syr. “you, by mercy *of God*, are of a proper age. Be you instead of me and my brother; (Jonathas, with whom Simon had governed. C.) and going out, fight valiantly for,” &c. H.  
**4** *Horsemen.* This is the first time we find them in the army. Judas had only infantry, as more conformable to the law; (Deut. 17. Tournem.) or he had not been able to procure any. H.  
**6** *He*, John. Ch.—A leader must be ever ready to set his men a pattern, which they will be ashamed not to follow. H.  
**8** *Holy.* Rom. edit. expresses this word, ( C.) which Grabe supplies. H.—The priests sounded, ( C.) and God fulfilled his promise of victory. Num. 10:9. M.—*Hold:* Gedor. C.  
**9** *Cedron*, otherwise called Gedor, the city that Cendebeus was fortifying. Ch.—The same mistake, ( C.) if it be one, ( H.) is made in Greek, C. 15:39.  
**10** *Towers* of wood, ( C.) erected for sentinels. Grot.  
**14** *Sabath*, now called *Sebeth*, corresponding to January and February. C.  
**15** *Doch* or *duk*, ( H.) in Syr. means “a watch tower.” Grot.—Josephus styles it Dagon. It was not far from Jericho, over which Ptolemee governed. He wished to rule over all the country, by calling in the Syrians. C.  
**16** *Plentifully.* Lit. “were inebriated.” But this expression often denotes no more than taking a moderate sufficiency, ( H.) or making good cheer, (Gen. 43:34. John 2:10. Lyr. T. C.) without any excess. Ps. 64:10. S. Aug. q. 144. Gen.—The first and last years of Simon were disturbed; the rest were spent in peace. He began A. 170. C. 13:41. W.—Nothing can be added to the praise bestowed upon this great man. C. 14:4. &c. Josephus ( C.) and the author of 4 Mac. 1. (or xx. Arab. H.) give a fabulous account of the siege of Doch. Ant. xiii. 14. and Bel. i. 2. See Salien, A. 3919. and Usher, 3869.  
**17** *Treachery.* Syr. “crime.” Gr. also, “revolt.” It seems that king Antiochus participated in this murder, and had promised the government of the country for a reward.  
**24** *Father.* Such annals were kept; and from these Josephus has collected his account of the latter times. C.—Some think that the Fourth B. of Mac. contains an extract of the work here mentioned. Six. Bib. i. Read 2 B. 1:1. W.—What is preserved in the seven middle chapters in the Arabic version is given by Calmet who omits the 19 first and 32 last chapters. The whole has been published by Desprez. It differs in many points from Josephus, in the history of Hircan. A. 3869, Sidetes besieged the new governor in Jerusalem, and after granting him a truce, during the octave of tabernacles, makes peace on very hard terms. Hircan takes money from the tomb of David, or rather from the secret treasures of the kings of Juda, and attends the king in his expedition into Persia, where Sidetes is slain, and the Macedonian yoke is entirely thrown off. A. 3874. The pontiff obliges the Idumeans to receive circumcision the following year. In 3877, he renews the alliance with the Romans. 4 B. 3. Soon after, the Jews write to their brethren in Alexandria. 2 B. 1:10. In 3894, Hircan undertakes the siege of Samaria, which his two sons continue. They defeat Antiochus of Cizicum, while Hircan puts Lathyrus to flight, and Samaria is razed to the ground. After a reign of twenty-nine years, Hircan dies. A. 3898. Eus. Dem. viii. 2. C.—Aristobulus, Alex. and Hircan, his children, succeed in order. Alexander Janneus, the son of the last, reigns prosperously, and his widow is afterwards regent for nine years. Her eldest son, Hircan, being opposed by Aristobulus, the interference of Pompey is desired. He takes the latter prisoner to Rome, A. 3955, when Augustus came into the world.—Cæsar being made dictator, liberated Aristobulus, who was now pontiff; but Pompey caused him, and Alex. his son, to be slain. Antipater, who had adhered to Hircan, procures Phasael and Herod, his sons, to be made governors of Judea and Galilee. The latter married Mariamne, daughter of Hircan, and the last of the Asmonean family, whom he afterwards put to death. He wrests the kingdom from Aristobolus; and having offended the people by some heathenish structures in compliment to Augustus, endeavours to please them by rebuilding the temple, A. 3982. Not long after, Christ appeared; and thus we are brought to the more happy days of the gospel. H.
