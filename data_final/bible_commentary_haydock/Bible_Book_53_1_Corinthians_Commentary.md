# 1 Corinthians Commentary

**Corinth** was the capital of Achaia, a very rich and populous city, where S. Paul had preached a year and a half, and converted a great many. See Acts 18:10. Now having received a letter from them, (c. 7:1) and being informed of divers disputes and divisions among them, (c. 1 v. 11) he wrote this letter to them, and sent it by the same persons, Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, who had brought him their letter, c. 16:17. It was written about the year 56, not from Philippi, as it is commonly marked at the end of the Greek copies, but rather from Ephesus. The subject and main design of this Epistle was to take away the divisions among them about the talents and merits of those who had baptized and preached to them, and to settle divers matters of ecclesiastical discipline. The apostle justifieth his mission, and his manner of preaching, c. 1 2 3 4. He teacheth them what was to be done with the man guilty of a scandalous sin of incest, c. 5. He speaks of sins against chastity; of matrimony; and of the state of continency, c. 6. and 7. Of meats offered to idols, c. 8. Of his manner of conversing with them, and what their conversation ought to be, c. 9. and 10. Of the holy sacrament of the Eucharist, c. 11. Of the different gifts of the Holy Ghost, and how to employ them, c. 12 13 and 14. Of the faith of the resurrection, c. 15. Of charitable contributions, and of his design of coming again to them, c. 16. Wi.—S. Paul having planted the faith in Corinth, where he had preached a year and a half, and converted a great many, went to Ephesus. After being there three years, he wrote this first Epistle to the Corinthians, and sent it by the same persons, Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, who had brought their letter to him. It was written about twenty-four years after our Lord’s ascension, and contains several matters appertaining to faith and morals, and also to ecclesiastical discipline. Ch.

## Chapter 1

**1** *Paul called* to be *an apostle.* S. Paul had preached to the Corinthians, and had remained a long time with them, to instruct and confirm them in the faith. During his absence, the faithful of Corinth were divided into several parties, on occasion of some new teachers, who had come amongst them. Calmet.—It was to heal the wounds caused by these divisions, that the present epistle was written. S. Thom. A.—*And Sosthenes.* There are various conjectures made concerning the person S. Paul here mentions. Some are of opinion that this Sosthenes is the same mentioned, Acts 18:17 who was beaten before the tribunal of Gallio, proconsul of Achaia, when S. Paul was carried before that magistrate. Eusebius says, that Sosthenes was one of the 72 disciples, and a different person from the one mentioned in Acts. Estius takes him to be S. Paul’s secretary. The common opinion is, that he was a great sufferer for the faith at Corinth, and S. Paul here mentions him as a man worthy their imitation. Calmet.  
**2** *In every place of theirs and ours.* Inasmuch as among Christians in all places there ought to be such an union in faith, and conformity of discipline, as if they were all in one place. Wi.  
**4** *That is given you in*, or *by Christ Jesus.* [1] Where we may take notice with S. Chrys. for the understanding of other places, that *in*, is many times put for *by* or *through.*  
**5** *Rich in him in all knowledge.* The apostles never addressed any epistle, except to persons who had been previously converted to the faith. Nor is it reasonable to expect, that infidel and pagan nations, merely by reading the inspired writings, will be able, by the light that is in them, to elicit from the said book the truths of religion. Would they not be tempted to worship the wily serpent, that succeeded in deceiving Eve? and how will they know that this serpent is the devil? A.  
**6** *As the testimony of Christ*, what Christ testified and taught *was confirmed in you*, that is, your faith in Christ hath been *confirmed* by those graces and gifts which you received from the Holy Ghost at your baptism, and when by imposition of hands you were confirmed by me, or some other bishop. Wi.  
**10** **. &c.** *That there is no schisms … contentions*, &c. To hinder these, was the chief design of this letter; one saying, *I am of Paul*, &c. each party bragging of their master by whom they had been baptized, and made Christians. *I am of Apollo*, the eloquent preacher, and *I of Cephas*, the head of the apostles, and of the whole Church; whilst others, the only party not to be blamed, contented themselves with saying, and *I am of Christ.*—*Is Christ divided?* Is not your salvation, is not your justification in baptism, and all gifts from him? Wi.  
**11** *Of Chloe.* It is worthy our observation, that S. Paul does not here mention any one person in particular, lest he might expose any one to the resentment of the rest, but mentions only in general terms the house of Chloe. S. Chrys. Theophyl.  
**12** Chloe was a Christian woman of Corinth. Apollo is the person mentioned, Acts 18:24. &c. Cephas is S. Peter, so called in the Syriac tongue. V.  
**13** *Was Paul crucified for you?* Though says S. Aug. brothers may die for brothers, yet the blood of no martyr is shed for the remission of a brother’s sin. See also S. Leo the Great, serm. xii. de pass. Dom.  
**14** *I give God thanks that I baptized* *none of you, but*, &c. It is strange that Quakers should from hence pretend, that S. Paul condemned baptism, when he only tells them, he is *glad* they were baptized by some other, rather than by him, lest they should say, they were baptized in his name, or think that baptism had a greater virtue, when given by a minister of greater sanctity; whereas it is Christ only, who is the chief minister, who gives grace in baptism, and in the other sacraments. This makes him say, *was Paul crucified for you*, &c. He tells them the occasion why he baptized few, because he was sent chiefly to *preach* and to be their apostle, whereas other inferior ministers were employed in baptizing. Wi.  
**17** **. &c.** *Not to baptize.* That is, the first and principal intent, in my vocation to the apostleship, was to *preach* the gospel, before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel. Acts c. 9:15. To *baptize* is common to all, but to *preach* is peculiarly the function of an apostle. Est. Menoc. Grot.—I was sent to *preach the gospel, not with wisdom of speech*, and as he says in the next chapter, (v. 13) not *in the persuasive words of human wisdom*, &c. The Spirit of God, which guided the thoughts and pen of S. Paul, and the other sacred writers, inspired them to deliver the gospel-truths with great simplicity, without the ornaments of an artificial human eloquence, *lest the cross of Christ should be made v* *oid*, lest the conversion of the world might be attributed to any human means, and not to the *power of God*, and of Christ crucified. Wi.  
**18** *For the word of the cross.* That is, the preaching that the Son of God, both God and man, died nailed to an infamous cross, *is folly*, is looked upon as ridiculous and incredible, by all obstinate unbelievers *that perish:* but it is received as the work of God, and an effect of his divine *power*, by such as are saved. Wi.  
**19** **Ver.** **19–20** **.** *I will destroy the wisdom of the wise.* I will confound the false and mistaken wisdom of the great and *wise* philosophers, of the learned doctors or scribes, of the curious *searchers* of the secrets of nature.—*Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world*, by the means he hath made use of to convert, and save the world, particularly by sending his only Son to die upon a cross? the preaching of which seems a folly, &c. only *they who are called*, believe Christ, though crucified, to be *the power and wisdom of God.* Wi.  
**21** *For seeing that in the wisdom of God*, &c. That is, by the works of the divine wisdom, by the visible creatures of this world, and the effects of his providence, the world had not *wisdom*, or was not wise enough, *to know* and worship God, as they might, and ought to have done: *it pleased God* to shew his power *by the foolishness of preaching*, by sending illiterate men to preach a God crucified, which to human wisdom seems a folly, and to *save* men by this *belief.* Wi.—The gospel, which I announce to you, though it appears folly to the vain philosopher, is the wisdom of God; and whilst it exhibits the picture of a crucified God, and teaches us the mortification of our senses, promises a happiness in the next life, not to be found in this. Vat. Grot. Tir. Just.  
**22** **Ver.** **22–25** **.** The Jews, in the mean time, ask for miracles, such as God formerly wrought in their favour, and the Greeks, or the Gentiles, to be converted, expect from us, what they would look upon as the highest points of human *wisdom* and knowledge; *for that which* appeareth *the foolishness of God, is wiser than men*, and able to confound the highest human wisdom; and *that which* appeareth *weakness of God, is stronger than men*, who cannot hinder God from converting the world, by means and methods, that seem so disproportioned to this his design. Wi.—*Foolishness.* That is to say, what appears *foolish* to the world in the ways of God, is indeed more wise: and what appears *weakness*, is indeed above all the strength and comprehension of man. Ch.  
**26** **Ver.** **26–28** **.** *Vocation*, is here used for the called, as Rom. 3:30 circumcision for the circumcised, (ibid. 11:7) election for the elected. V.—Consider your manner of being called; not many, hitherto, of those who have believed, or of those who have preached the gospel, *are wise acco* *rding to the flesh*, or as to worldly wisdom; and in the esteem of men, *not many mighty, not many noble.* God hath chosen such as are looked upon as illiterate, without power, without riches, without human wisdom, to confound the great and wise men: He hath chosen the *things that are not*, that is, says S. Chrys. men reputed as nothing, of no consideration, to confound, to destroy, to make subject to him, and to the gospel, men who had the greatest worldly advantages, *that no flesh*, no men how great, wise, rich, or powerful soever, *might glory* in his sight, or attribute their call, and their salvation to their own merits.—*From him you are in Christ Jesus* brought to believe in him, *who is made to us wisdom*, acknowledged to be the wisdom of his eternal Father, by whom we have been justified, sanctified, redeemed. We have nothing of ourselves to boast of, and can only *glory in the Lord.* Wi.—*And the mean things.* In the beginning of Christianity, it was frequently objected to the Christians, that they had none but men of the basest extraction. The emperor Julian likewise made the Catholics the same reproach. Grot.—But this objection was not founded; for we find many persons of consideration mentioned in the Scriptures, who had embraced Christianity. Witness, v. 1 of this chap. Sosthenes, the head of the synagogue at Corinth, and some in the very palace of Cæsar.  
**29** *Glory in his s* *ight.* God wished it to be known, that the establishment of his Church was not the work of human wisdom or power, but of the omnipotent power of his divinity. Calmet.

## Chapter 2

**3** *In weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.* We must not think, says S. Chrys. that this made the virtue of S. Paul less commendable. It is natural to every man to fear persecutions and torments. We admire the apostle, who amidst these fears, was always ready to expose himself, was always fighting, and always victorious. Wi.—During the stay I made with you at Corinth, I saw myself daily exposed to injuries, affronts, and persecutions. I had then the opportunity of practising the lessons which our expiring Redeemer delivered to us from the wood on which he died, and the daily contradictions I met with obliged me to think of other things than fine discourses, and elegant harangues. Theophyl.  
**4** *In the shewing of the spirit and power*, &c. The gifts of the Holy Ghost bestowed on those that believed, and the miracles which God wrought by his apostles, were the means God made use of to convert the world, which were of much greater force than human eloquence. Wi.  
**5** *That your faith*, &c. Had we employed the subtleties, the reasonings, and eloquence of men, some might perhaps be induced to believe that you had been seduced by artifice. But none can reasonably say so; your faith is founded on the force and evidence of truth, and upon the virtue and power of the Holy Ghost, who has bestowed upon you both the light of knowledge, and the fire of love. Theod.  
**6** **. &c.** *Wisdom among the perfect.* That is, when we first came amongst you, you were incapable of understanding the great mysteries of our religion: we therefore preached to you Christ crucified; (Calmet) but to the true perfect disciples of Christ we reveal the most sacred mysteries. S. Chrys.—By wisdom, here seems to be understood a more sublime doctrine concerning the most abstruse mysteries of faith, which the ignorant could not understand. To the same purpose he tells them in the next chapter and in the 5th chapter to the Hebrews, that *milk* is the proper food of little children, not *solid meat*, which is proper *for those that are perfect.*—*Yet* we speak *not the wisdom of this world*, nor of the great men, and *princes* of this world, because the doctrine of the Christian faith, which we preached, is not esteemed wisdom, but folly by them, who pretend to worldly wisdom.—*We speak* then in a mystery, or after a mysterious manner, according to the capacity of those that hear us, the *great wisdom of God*, which *hidden*, and not understood by the wise men of this world, God hath manifested by the incarnation of his Son, and by our redemption; which mystery, and which wisdom, *none of* *the princes of this world knew*, that is, the devils, according to the common interpretation; or Pilate, Herod, Caiphas, &c. according to S. Chrys. *or they would never have crucified*, nor have permitted others to crucify, *the Lord of glory*, Jesus Christ, who by his divine person is truly the Lord of glory. See S. Aug. l. i. de Trin. c. 12. &c. He may also be called the *Lord of glory*, because of that glory, which from eternity he predestinated, and decreed to give his elect; and of which it is written, that *the eye hath not seen*, &c. Wi.  
**8** It appears from the gospel, that they suspected Jesus might be the Son of God; but the major part of interpreters judge from this text, that they had not a certain knowledge. V.  
**10** *But to us God hath revealed them by his Spirit;* these mysteries, and secrets of the divine wisdom.—*For the Spirit searcheth all things:* the divine Spirit, the Holy Ghost, searcheth all things, and none but this Spirit of God, that is, this Spirit, which is God, *knoweth the things that are of God*, as none but the *spirit that is in man*, knoweth *the things of man*, knoweth his thoughts and interior affections. But by the *Spirit of God*, we may understand the spirit of grace, of knowledge, of prophecy, which God hath given to his faithful, and particularly to his apostles, to raise them to a higher knowledge of the divine mysteries. Wi.  
**11** *For what man?* As the secrets of man’s heart are known only to himself, so the mysteries of the divinity are known only to the Spirit, who is God, and who proceedeth from the Father and the Son. Theophyl.  
**13** *W* *hich* mysteries and divine truths, we apostles (even when we speak to the more perfect sort of men) deliver *not in the learned words of human wisdom*, not in the fine language, studied periods and sentences arranged by the art of rhetoric, but *in the doctrine of the Spirit*, that is, as the Spirit of God within us teacheth us for the good of those that hear us.—*Comparing spiritual things with spiritu* *al*, that is, treating of spiritual things with persons that are more spiritual and more perfect, adapting our discourses to the capacity of those we speak to. Others will have the sense to be: *we comp* *are spiritual things with spiritual* things, that is, we treat of such matters after a spiritual manner, with proofs and examples out of the revealed Scriptures, &c. Wi.—S. Paul seems in this place to answer an objection that might be brought against him. If, as you say, you are gifted with a knowledge of mysteries, who do you not reveal those mysteries to us? To this he seems to answer, because to spiritual persons, we impart spiritual knowledge. Calmet.  
**14** **Ver.** **14–15** **.** *But the sensual man*, &c. They who are led away by sensual pleasures, do not even *perceive* or understand spiritual things; they seem foolish to them, and a folly to seek after them; *because* such things must be *spiritually examined*, that is, examined by the Spirit of God, which they have not.—*But the spiritual man judgeth all thi* *ngs*, passeth a right judgment, not only of the things of this life, as carnal men can do, but even of spiritual things, which concern his eternal salvation.—*And he himself is judged by no one*, that is, by no one, who is not spiritual, or who is not taught by the Spirit of God, to pass a right judgment: the sense also may be, that he cannot be justly blamed or condemned by any worldly man, who knows not how to judge of such spiritual things. Wi.—The sensual man is either he who is taken up with sensual pleasures, with carnal and worldly affections: or he who measureth divine mysteries by natural reason, sense, and human wisdom only. Now such a man has little or no notion of the things of God. Whereas the spiritual man, in the mysteries of religion, takes not human sense for his guide; but submits his judgment to the decisions of the Church, which he is commanded to hear and obey. For Christ hath promised to remain to the end of the world with his Church, and to direct her in all things by the Spirit of truth. Ch.  
**16** *For who* among the sensual men of the world, *hath known the mind* of the Lord, so as to be able to instruct him, or them, whom he guides by his spirit.—*But we*, whom he has chosen to be his apostles, *have the mind of Christ;* having been taught and instructed by the Spirit of Christ. Some enthusiasts and fanatics pretend from this passage of S. Paul, that they being led and inspired by the spirit, *can be judged by no one* in matters of faith and religion. *They* pervert and *wrest* the words of S. Paul, *as they do also other Scriptures*, to their *own perdition.* 2 Pet. 3:16. First, because no one knows by his pretended private spirit, that he is truly such a spiritual man, who has the Spirit of God in him: and many have too much reason to know by their sensual carnal lives, that they have it not. Secondly, S. Paul here speaks only of spiritual men in opposition to sensual men, and only says that they who are spiritual, have the spirit of discretion to judge what things are spiritual, and what are not; and that none can judge rightly of these matters, but they who are spiritual, guided by the Spirit. Thirdly, as to controversies about religion, the proper spiritual judges appointed by our Saviour, Christ, are the bishops, whom he has appointed to govern his Church, with an entire submission of every man’s private judgment, and private spirit, to the judgment of the Catholic Church, which he has commanded us to hear and obey, with which he has promised to remain to the end of the world, and to direct her in all things by the spirit of truth. Wi.

## Chapter 3

**3** *And walk according to man?* As carnal and sensual men, as long as there are jealousies and divisions among you. Wi.  
**7** **Ver.** **7–8** **.** *That planteth* you by your first conversion. Apollo *watered* you by preaching the same truths.—He that *planteth* and *watered, are one*, aim at one and the same end. Wi.—*According to his own labour.* God does not recompense his servants according to the success of their labours, because their success depends upon him alone; but he recompenses them according to their sufferings and diligence in his service; for, whilst he crowns the labour of his apostles with success, he crowns his own work. S. Chrys.—This text most evidently proves that good works proceeding from grace are meritorious, and that the rewards in heaven are different, according as God sees just to appropriate them. The Greek word here employed is μισθος, (merces) or wages. See 1 Tim. 5:18. Apoc. 22:12. Matt. 16:27. It is by our union with Jesus Christ that our actions, of themselves without value or merit, become gold, silver, and precious stones. A.  
**9** *We are God’s coadjutors*, labouring in his service, as he hath employed us.—*You are God’s husbandry*, the soil, where virtues are to be planted. *You are God’s building*, the edifice, the house, or even the temple of God; we are employed as builders under God. Wi.  
**10** *I have laid the foundation* well, *as a wise architec* *t*, not of myself, *but according to the grace of God*, and the gifts he bestowed upon me: and *another*, or several others, *build upon it*, continue the building.—*But let every man take heed how he buildet* *h*, and that it be always upon the same *foundation*, which is *Christ Jesus*, his faith, and his doctrine. Wi.  
**12** **Ver.** **12–15** **.** *Now if any man build*, &c. This is a hard place, says S. Aug. l. de fid. & Oper. c. xvi. tom. 6. p. 180. The interpreters are divided, as to the explication and application of this metaphorical comparison, contained in these four verses. S. Paul speaks of *a building*, where it is evident, says S. Aug. that the *foundation* is Christ, or the faith of Christ, and his faith working by charity. The difficulties are 1. Who are the *builders.* 2. What is meant by *gold, silver, precious st* *ones*, and what by *wood, hay, stubble.* 3. What is meant by *the day of the Lord.* 4. What by *fire*, how *every one’s work* shall be *tried*, and how some shall be *saved by fire.* As to the first, by the *builde* *rs*, as S. Paul had before called himself the first *architect*, who had laid the foundation of the faith of Christ among the Corinthians, interpreters commonly understand those doctors and preachers who there succeeded S. Paul: but as it is also said, that *every man’s works* shall be *made manifest*, S. Aug. and others understand not the preachers only, but all the faithful. As to the second difficulty, if by the builders we understand the preachers of the gospel, then *by gold, silver*, &c., is to be understood, good, sound, and profitable doctrine; and *by wood, hay, stubble*, a mixture of vain knowledge, empty flourishes, unprofitable discourses; but if all the faithful are builders, they whose actions are pure, lay *gold* upon the foundation; but if their actions *are mixed with* imperfections, venial failings, and lesser sins, these are represented by *wood, hay, stubble*, &c. 3. By *the day of the Lord*, is commonly understood either the day of general judgment, or the particular judgment, when every one is judged at his death, which sentence shall be confirmed again at the last day. 4. As to *fire*, which is mentioned thrice, if we consider what S. Paul says here of fire, he seems to use it in different significations, as he many times does other words. First, he tells us, (v. 13) that *the day of the Lord … shall be revealed;* or, as it is in the Greek, *is revealed in*, or by *fire;* where, by *fire*, is commonly understood the just and severe judgments of God, represented by the metaphor of *fire.* Secondly, he tells us in the same verse, that *fire shall try every one’s work, of what sort it* *is.* This may be again taken for the examining and trying fire of God’s judgments: and may be applied to the builders, whether preachers only or all the faithful. Thirdly, he tells us, (v. 14 and 15) that some men’s works *abide* the fire of God’s judgments, they deserve no punishment, they are like pure gold, which receives no prejudice from the fire: but some men’s *works* burn, the superstructure, which they built upon the faith of Christ, besides *gold, silver, precious stones*, had also a mixture of *wood, hay, stubble*, which could not stand the trial of fire, which met with combustible matter, that deserved to be burnt. Every such man shall *suffer a loss*, when his works are burnt, *but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.* Here the apostle speaks of fire in a more ample signification: of a fire which shall not only try, and examine, but also *burn*, and punish the builders, who notwithstanding shall also, after a time, escape from the fire, and be *saved by fire*, and in *the day of th* *e Lord*, that is, after life (for the time of this life is the day of men). Divers of the ancient fathers, as well as later interpreters, from these words, prove the Catholic doctrine of a purgatory, that is, that many Christians, who die guilty, not of heinous or mortal sins, but of lesser, and what are called venial sins, or to whom a temporal punishment for the sins they have committed, still remains due, before they can be admitted to a *reward* in heaven, (into which nothing *defiled* or *unclean can enter*) must suffer some punishments for a time, in some place, which is called Purgatory, and in such a manner, as is agreeable to the divine justice, before their reward in heaven. These words of the apostle, the Latin Fathers in the Council of Florence [1] brought against the Greeks to prove purgatory, to which the Greeks (who did not deny a purgatory, or a third place, where souls guilty of lesser sins were to suffer for a time) made answer, that these words of S. Paul were expounded by S. Chrys. and some of their Greek Fathers (which is true) of the wicked in hell, who are said to *be saved by fire*, inasmuch as they always subsist and continue in those flames, and are not destroyed by them: but this interpretation, as the Latin bishops replied, is not agreeable to the style of the holy Scriptures, in which, *to be saved*, both in the Greek and Latin, is expressed the salvation and happiness of souls in heaven. It may not be amiss to take notice that the Greeks, before they met with the Latins at Ferrara, of Florence, did not deny the Catholic doctrine of purgatory. They admitted a third place, where souls guilty of lesser sins, suffered for a time, till cleansed from such sins: they allowed that the souls there detained from the vision of God, might be assisted by the prayers of the faithful: they called this purgatory a place of *darkness*, of *sorrow*, of *punishments*, and *pains*, but they did not allow there a true and material fire, which the Council did not judge necessary to decide and define against them, as appears in the definition of the Council. Conc. Labb tom. xiii. p. 515. Wi.—The fire of which S. Paul here speaks, is the fire of purgatory, according to the Fathers, and all Catholic divines. Calmet.—S. Augustin, expounding Ps. xxxvii. v. 1 gives the proper distinction between this fire of purgatory and that of hell: both are punishments, one temporary, the other eternal; the latter to punish us in God’s justice, the former to amend us in his mercy.  
**16** **Ver.** **16–17** **.** *Know you not.* After the apostle had described the builders who are employed in the spiritual edifice, he then proceeds to speak of the duties of those who are the living temples of Christ. As for you, may brethren, who are the temples of God, preserve yourselves in purity of faith, and innocence of morals. Fly from those false apostles who seek your ruin, and remain steadfast in that faith which you have received from us; (Calmet) that is, the one, holy, Catholic and apostolic faith. What a happiness for the faithful minister to assist in erecting and ornamenting the living temples of God; but what punishment must await the unfaithful minister, who by his own neglect and bad example, helps to ruin and destroy the temples God himself had entrusted to his care! A.—*The Spirit of God dwelleth in you*, having received the grace of God at your conversion: you are the *holy temple of God:* *But if any one violate*, or profane *the temple of God*, either by false doctrine, or by any grievous offence, he destroys the spiritual edifice, that was built in his soul upon the faith and grace of God. He cannot be said to be built any longer upon the same foundation: and therefore *God will destroy* such persons: they shall not be saved even by fire, or temporal punishments, but shall be excluded for ever from heaven, and condemned to eternal punishments. Wi.  
**18** **Ver.** **18–21** **.** *Let no man deceive himself.* He next precautions them against themselves, and admonishes them to be upon their guard against curiosity, presumption, and self-love, and tells them to undervalue all other sciences, when put in competition with the science of salvation, the knowledge of the gospel. It hence appears, that some of the Corinthians were renowned for that human eloquence which the world so much esteems, and accordingly the apostle discovers to them the danger to which they are exposing themselves, by pursuing their present line of conduct. Calmet.—*If any man among you seem to be wise in this world.* He hints at some new teachers among them, (not at Apollo) who to gain the esteem of men, had introduced errors from profane philosophy, or the false principles of human wisdom, which, as he had told them before, was *folly* in the sight of God. He therefore tells such persons, that to become truly *wise*, they must become *fools*, by returning to the simplicity of the gospel-doctrine. Wi.—*Let no man.* That is, let no man say, I am for Paul, I am for Apollo. This language will introduce into the Church of God those various sects that existed amongst the philosophers, who were distinguished by the title of Platonics, Stoics, Peripatetic, and so on. Grotius.  
**22** **Ver.** **22–23** **.** *All things are yours.* Are ordained for your good. For this end, I, Apollo, and Cephas have been sent to promote your salvation. *The world* and *all things* in it are allowed you, *are yours*, that by making good use of them, you may save your souls: that *death* may be to you a passage to a happy eternity, that *the things to come* may be your eternal reward.—*You are Christ’s*, you belong to him who hath redeemed you, and sanctified you by his grace: *and Christ is God’s*, Christ as man, who being the Son of God, was made also man, and sent to make known the glory of God, his divine perfections of mercy, justice, &c.

**1** *Mysteries of God.* That is, the dogmas of faith, revealed by the Almighty. Estius.  
**3** *Or by human judgment.* Lit. *by human day.* The sense, says S. Jerom, is, by any human judgment, or by men, whose judgment is in the day, or time of this life: but God judges in his day, after this life, and chiefly at the last day of judgment.—*Neither do I judge myself*, so as to look upon myself absolutely certain of the state of my soul, or that I am for certain justified, though *I am not conscious to myself of any thing*, because I am to be judged by an omniscient God, the great searcher of hearts, who perhaps may discover faults, which I, partial to myself, overlook. Now if S. Paul durst not say, he was justified, what presumption is it for others to pretend to an absolute certainty, that they are just in the sight of God! Wi.  
**4** *For I am not conscious.* This great apostle of the Gentiles, though conscious to himself of no breach of duty, still does not dare to call himself just. How different is the conduct of this apostle, from those wicked impostors, who teach, that a man is justified by believing himself so. Est.—If this privileged apostle was afraid to from any judgment of his own heart and thoughts, whether they were pure or not, but left the trial thereof to the day of judgment, the day of his death, how presumptuous are they, who dare to pronounce on their election and predestination!  
**5** *Judge not*, &c. He gives them an admonition against rash and false judgments, and hints at those among them, who said, this man is better, this man is greater than such a one, &c. See S. Chrys. Wi.  
**6** *These things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself, and to Apollo.* Lit. *these things have I transfigured in me and Apollo*, that is, I have represented the divisions and disputes among you, as if it were by your contending, whether I, or Apollo, or Cephas were the best preachers, without naming those, as I might do, who are the true causes of these divisions, by striving who should be thought men of the greatest and brightest parts.—*That in us*, and by our example, who have no such proud disputes, *you might learn that one be not puffed u* *p against the other*, and *above that which is written*, against the admonitions given in the holy Scriptures of being humble: or against what I have now written to you, that we must strive for nothing, but to be the *faithful* ministers of God, and not seek the esteem of men. Wi.—It is the opinion of S. Tho. Aqu. and likewise of Estius, that S. Paul, Apollo, and Cephas were not the real causes of the divisions that existed amongst the new converts at Corinth, but that in making use of these names, he wished to teach them, that if it was unlawful to keep up these divisions even for the sake of the apostles, how far should they be from doing any thing of this kind for those whose authority was much less in the Church. But Calmet is of opinion, that the divisions amongst the Corinthians were certainly on account of Paul, Apollo, Cephas, and perhaps some others, whose names are not mentioned.  
**7** *For who distinguisheth*, or *hath distinguished thee* from another? He speaks particularly to those proud, vain preachers: if thou hast greater talents than another man, who hath given them to thee, or to any one, but God, who is the giver, and the author of every gift and perfection? This is not only true of the gift of preaching, but of all gifts and graces; so that S. Aug. makes use of it in several places against the Pelagians, to shew that it is by grace only, that one man is preferred before another, and not by, or for his own merits. Wi.  
**8** *Now you are satiated*, &c. You great, vain preachers, you are *rich* in every kind, blessed with all gifts, &c. *You reign* over the minds of the people, *without* us, you stand not in need of our assistance. *And I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.* I wish your reigning and governing the people were well grounded on virtue and truth, that we might be sharers of the like happiness. S. Chrys. takes notice, that S. Paul speaks thus, meaning the contrary, by the figure called *irony:* and so also S. Chrys. understands the two following verses, as if S. Paul only represented what those vain preachers said with contempt of him, as if he were only an apostle of an inferior rank, not one of the chief, nor of the twelve. And when he says, *we are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are wise:* it is certain the apostles were not *fools*, nor these preachers whom he blames, *wise*, especially in Christ. But though the apostle partly use this figure of irony, intermixing it in his discourse, yet he also represents the condition of all true apostles, and preachers of Christ crucified, whose persons and doctrine were slighted, ridiculed, and laughed at by men that were wise only with worldly wisdom, especially by profane libertines, and atheistical men, that make a jest of all revealed religion. To go about preaching in *hunger*, in *thirst*, in *nakedness*, in *want*, under afflictions and persecutions, is what they think is to be miserable: they despise such men as the *out-cast*, the *dross*, [1] and the *dregs* of mankind. (See the Greek text.) Wi.—He speaks to the Corinthians, who forgetting their first fervour, and the Christian modesty which S. Paul had taught them, both by word and example, were endeavouring to distinguish themselves by the reputation and honour of the apostle, who had converted them, by their antiquity of faith, and by other things more frivolous. Calm.  
**9** *Made a spectacle.* It is evident from the writings of S. Paul, and from innumerable other records, that the apostles were made a spectacle to the world and to men; but how, some one may perhaps ask, were they made a spectacle to angels? S. Chrys. Theod. and many others think, that the apostle is here speaking of the good angels, who behold with pleasure the labours and afflictions of the saints, knowing that it will prove a source of glory; but Estius, Vat. and some others, are of opinion, that the wicked angels are here spoken of, who rejoice at the persecutions of God’s servants, and wish to revenge themselves for the destruction of their empire.  
**14** **Ver.** **14–17** **.** *I write not.* S. Paul here insinuates to the Corinthians, that they ought to blush with shame for neglecting the apostles, who had suffered so many hardships for them, to follow after teachers void of honour, and to glory in being called the disciples of such men. Estius.—*I admonish you as my dearest children*, of what is for your good, and I may take this liberty, as being your spiritual father in Christ, by whom you were first made Christians. *Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ:* follow the doctrine of Christ, which I follow, and taught you. *Timothy*, my beloved *son in the Lord*, whom I send to you, will *put you in* mind of what I teach, and of what I practise. Wi.  
**18** **. &c.** *Some* of those new doctors and preachers *are so puffed up*, that they pretend I dare not come to you any more, nor defend myself: he may also mean the man that lived in incest, his companions and his flatterers.—But *I will come to you shortly*, and then I shall use my authority in taking notice of their vain talk, they shall find and experience that *power*, which God hath given me by the gifts of the Holy Ghost, and of working miracles. Wi.—*But I will come.* The good effect which this letter produced amongst the Corinthians retarded his intended journey, so that he did not go to Corinth till one or two years after this letter was written. He wrote his second epistle to the same before he paid them a visit, to apply a soothing remedy to their minds and hearts, sorely afflicted with his charitably severe corrections contained in this his first epistle. A.—*What will you;* or what disposition shall I find in you? let it not be necessary for me to use *the* chastising *rod* by excommunications, and other spiritual arms, but be so reformed before I come, that I may come to you in the *spirit* of mildness, as I wish to do. Wi.

## Chapter 5

**1** *As the like is not among the heathens.* This seems to have been the crime of incest, that he took the wife of his father yet living. See 2 Cor. 7 v. 12. Wi.—S. Chrys. Theod. &c. think, that this incestuous person was one of the chiefs of the schism which then reigned in Corinth. This man, say they, was a great orator, with whose eloquence the Corinthians were enchanted, and therefore dissembled a knowledge of his crime, public as it was. The apostle having proved to them the vanity of all human learning, in the preceding chapter, now attacks the incestuous man, and exposes to their view the enormity of his crime. Calm.  
**2** *You are puffed up*, seem to be unconcerned, to take pride in it, instead of having the man separated from you. Wi.  
**3** **. &c.** *Have already jud* *ged*, decreed, and do decree, being *present in spirit* with you, and with your congregation.—*In the name … with the power of our Lord Jesus, to deliver such a one to* Satan by a sentence of excommunication, depriving him of the sacraments, the prayers, and communion, and even of the conversation of the rest of the faithful. It is likely in those times, such excommunicated persons were delivered over to Satan, so as to be corporally tormented by the devil, to strike a terror into others. See S. Chrys. hom. xv. and this is said to be done *for the destruction*, or punishment *of the flesh*, that the *sp* *irit*, or soul, *may be saved.* Wi.—It is the opinion of most of the Greek fathers, that this man was either really possessed by the devil, or at least struck with such a complaint as a mortification, and humiliation to his body, whilst it served to purify his soul. We have seen from many instances in holy Scripture, that it was not unusual, in the origin of Christianity, for persons who had fallen into crimes of this nature, to be punished with death, some grievous sickness, or by being possessed by the devil. But most divines are of opinion that this man was delivered over to the devil, so as to be separated from the communion of the Church. Amb. Est. Just. Menoc.  
**6** **Ver.** **6–8** **.** *Your glorying is not good*, when you suffer such a scandal among you: you have little reason to boast of your masters, or even of the gifts and graces you received. A *little leaven corrupteth the whole mass;* a public scandal, when not punished, is of dangerous consequence.—*Purge out the old leaven.* He alludes to the precept given to the Jews of having no leaven in their houses during the seven days of the Paschal feast. For our Pasch, i.e. Paschal lamb, *Christ is sacrificed:* and Christians, says S. Chrys. must keep this feast continually, by always abstaining from the leaven of sin. Wi.  
**9** **. &c.** *I wrote to you in an epistle.* If he does not mean what he has said already in this epistle, it must have been in some other, which he had written to them before, (as some conjecture) and which is not now extant.—*Now to keep company with fornicators*, nor with such like public scandalous sinners, *not so much as to* *eat* with them. But you must take notice, that I mean, when they are *brethren*, or Christians, not when they are infidels, for this cannot be avoided, especially by those who are to labour to convert them. This admonition of the apostle, shews us how much such persons are to blame, who by their carriage encourage, applaud, and are delighted with wicked company. Them who are *without* the pale and fold of the Church, the apostle leaves to the great *judge* of the living and the dead. Wi.  
**12** *To judge them that are without.* Those who are said by the apostle to be without, are those who have never been converted to the faith, and therefore are not within the jurisdiction of the Church.  
**13** *Take away.* This passage is differently understood by commentators. By some it is understood thus: expel the evil one from among you, that is, the incestuous man. Estius.—By others, it is understood to be spoken in a general sense, meaning, take away the evil of sin from among you. Calmet.

## Chapter 6

**1** *Go to law before the unjust.* S. Paul here dissuades the new Christians from carrying their differences and causes about their temporal concerns before judges who were infidels, especially seeing the saints and the elect shall one day *judge*, that is, condemn all the wicked, and even the apostate *angels*, by approving the sentence which Christ shall pronounce against them at the day of judgment. Wi.—It was not unusual in the primitive ages, and even under Christian emperors, for the Catholics to refer their disputes to the bishop, and to abide by his decision, as Possidius informs us, in the life of S. Augustin. Est.  
**3** *Judge angels?* That is, the wicked angels, the devils. S. Tho. Aqui.  
**4** **Ver.** **4–7** **.** *Set them to judge, who are the most despised in the Church.* Rather make choice of Christians of lesser parts and talents, than have recourse to infidels, who will be scandalized at the injuries and injustice done by Christians to each other. Besides you cannot but have some wise men among you to decide such matters. Wi.—S. Paul does not here mean to tell the Corinthians that they must choose the most despised and the most ignorant, but he wishes to inform them that if there were none but men of this description in the Church, it would still be much more preferable to appoint these judges than to go to law before idolatrous judges. Estius.—It is *plainly a fault*, [1] weakness in you to run to such heathen judges: you should rather bear, and put up with the injuries done to you.—*A fault.* Law-suits can hardly ever be without a fault, on one side or the other; and oftentimes on both sides. Ch.  
**8** **Ver.** **8–11** **.** *Defraud … your brethren.* That is, you still make yourselves much more guilty by the injustices done to one another: for the *unjust*, and all they who are guilty of such crimes as I have mentioned, *shall not possess the kingdom of God.* And some of you were guilty of part of them, which have been *washed* off by your conversion, and your *baptism*, when you were *justified.* Wi.—*And such some of you were.* It is probable that this was added by the apostle, to soften his preceding words, lest he might seem to accuse all the Corinthians of each of these sins, and he likewise adds, such indeed you were, but now you are washed, &c. &c. Estius, S. Tho. Aq.  
**12** *All things are lawful to me.* We cannot take the words in the obvious sense, S. Paul having just before declared, that *unjust* dealers, *fornicators, drunkards, shall not possess the kingdom of God.* Some expound the words, as if he said, I have free-will and liberty to do what I will. Others think that the apostle speaks not of all things in general, but with this or the like limitation, all things that are indifferent of their own nature, or all things that are not forbidden by the law of God, and this seems agreeable enough to what he had said of going to judges that were infidels, which, though not a thing unlawful in itself, *was not expedient.* It may also be connected with what follows of *meats*, to signify that in the new law any meats may be eaten; (see c. 8) but it may *be expedient* to abstain, when it would be a scandal to the weak.—*But I will not be brought under the power of any.* It does not appear by the Latin or Greek text, whether the construction be under the power of *any* person or of any *thing.* There are divers interpretations; the most probable seems to be, that these words are again to be taken as connected with what went before, and with what follows, to wit, that though it be not unlawful in itself to go before judges that are infidels, or to eat any kind of meats, yet I will not permit my love of money, nor my sensual appetite, to make me a slave to such passions, so as to do things that are not convenient, much less to do things unlawful. Wi.—*All things are* *lawful*, &c. That is, all *indifferent things* are indeed lawful, inasmuch as they are not prohibited; but oftentimes they are not expedient; as in the case of law-suits, &c. And much less would it be expedient to be enslaved by an irregular affection to any thing, how indifferent soever. Ch.  
**13** **. &c.** *Meat for the belly.* That is, meat is necessary for the support of nature, though this or that kind of meat be indifferent: and we ought to reflect, that God in a short time will *destroy* both the meats, and the appetite of eating, and the body shall shortly die, but it shall rise again.—*Know you* *not that your bodies are the members of Christ …* and *the temple of the Holy Ghost.* Man consists of soul and body; by baptism he is made a member of that same mystical body, the Church, of which Christ is the head: In baptism both the soul and body are consecrated to God: they are made the temple of the Holy Ghost, inasmuch as the spirit and grace of God inhabits in men, who are sanctified. Christ redeemed both our souls and bodies, both which he designs to sanctify, and to glorify hereafter in heaven; so that we must look upon both body and soul as belonging to Christ, and not *as our own.*—*Sha* *ll I, then, taking the members of Christ, make them the members of an harlot*, by a shameful and unlawful commerce?—*Fly fornication.* Such sins are chiefly to be avoided by flight, and by avoiding the occasions and temptations. Other sins are not committed by such an injury done to the body, but by an abuse of something else, that is different from the body, but by fornication and sins of uncleanness, the body itself is defiled and dishonoured, whereas the body ought to be considered as if it *were not our own*, being redeemed by our Saviour Christ, consecrated to him, with an expectation of a happy resurrection, and of being glorified in heaven. Endeavour, therefore, to glorify God in your body, by employing it in his service, and bear him in your body by being obedient to his will. Wi.—We know and we believe that we carry about Jesus Christ in our bodies, but it is the shame and condemnation of a Christian to live as if he neither knew or believed it. If fornication is a great crime in a pagan, in a Christian it is a species of sacrilege, accompanied with injustice and ingratitude. Whoever yields to impurity, converts his body into the temple of Satan, glorifies and carries him about, tearing away the members of Jesus Christ, to make them the members of a harlot.

## Chapter 7

**1** *Now concerning.* The heads of the Church of Corinth had written to S. Paul, desiring to know whether he thought it more expedient to marry or not. This was a question which the sages of antiquity had frequently taken into consideration. To this question S. Paul here delivers his opinion. Calmet.—Others, with greater probability, suppose the chief question proposed to S. Paul was, whether they were not bound, upon their conversion, to abstain from their infidel wives. S. Jer. cont. Jovin. c. iv. S. Chrys. in hunc. locum. hom. xix.—To this he answers in v. 12 and 13.—*It is* *good.* That is, according to the style of the Scriptures, *it is better*, if we consider the advantage of every particular, &c. Wi.  
**2** **. &c.** But *because of fornication, let every man have*, and live with *his own wife*, [1] and not leave her, nor dismiss her. Take notice, that S. Paul speaks these words to those that are already married, and speaks not of the unmarried till the 8th verse. He does not then here exhort every one to marry, but admonishes married persons to live together, and not to refuse the marriage duty, which neither the husband nor the wife can do without mutual consent, because of the marriage engagement. Yet he advises them to abstain sometimes from what they may lawfully do, that they may *give themselves to prayer*, [2] and as it is added in the common Greek copies, *to fas* *ting.* S. Chrys. observes, that the words of S. Paul, are not only, that *they may pray*, (which no day must be omitted) but that they *may give themselves to prayer*, that is, may be better disposed and prepared for prayer, contemplation, and for receiving the holy Sacrament, as we find the priests even of the ancient law, were to abstain from their wives, when they were employed in the functions of their ministry. But such kind of advice is not relished by all that pretend to be reformers. *And return together again … yet I speak this by way of indulgence*, of what is allowed to married persons, and not commanded them, unless when one of the married couple is not willing to abstain. Wi.  
**6** *By indulgence.* That is, by a condescension to your weakness. Ch.  
**7** **Ver.** **7–8** **.** *I would*, or I could wish you *all were even as myself*, and as it is said in the next verse, to *continue* unmarried *as I do.* From hence it is evident, that S. Paul was not then married, who according to the opinion of the ancient fathers, was never married. But when the apostle says, *I would* this as to *you all*, he only signifies what could be wished for, the particular good of every one considered as a particular person, but what cannot be hoped for, considering the state of mankind in general, and the temptations, and frailty of men.—*But every one hath his proper gift from God*, so that some prudently embrace a single life, and also make a religious vow of always living so, as it has been practised by a great number both of men and women in all ages, ever since Christ’s time. Others have not this more perfect gift: they find themselves not disposed to lead, or vow a single life, they marry lawfully: *it is better to marry than to burn*, or be burnt by violent temptations of concupiscence, by which they *do not contai* *n themselves* from disorders of that kind. It is against both the Latin and Greek text to translate, *they cannot contain themselves*, as in the Prot. and Mr. N …’s translation. Dr. Wells, in his paraphrase, gives the sense of this place in these words: The inconveniences of marriage are to be undergone, rather than such sinful imaginations, or practises, as arise from the flames of an ungovernable lust. They therefore that are unmarried or widows, (to whom S. Paul speaks in these two verses) may have recourse to marriage as a remedy. But let it be observed, that when S. Paul allows of marriage, he speaks not of those who have already made a vow of living always a single life. Vows made to God must be kept. Ps. 75:12. Eccl. 5:3. And S. Paul expressly says of such persons, who have made a vow of perpetual continency, and afterwards marry, *that they incur damnation, because they violate their first faith*, or vow made to God. See 1 Tim. 5:12. This saying, therefore, *it is better to marry tha* *n to burn*, cannot justify the sacrilegious marriages of priests, or of any others who were under such vows. There are other remedies which they are bound to make use of, and by which they may obtain the gift of continency and chastity. They must ask this gift by fervent prayers to God, who gives a *good spirit to them that ask it.* Luke 11:15. They must join fasting, alms, and the practice of self-denials, so often recommended in the gospel. See the annotations on Mat. 19. The like remedies, and no others, must they use, who being already in wedlock, are under such violent temptations, that they are continually in danger of violating, or do violate the chastity of the marriage-bed. For example, when married persons are divorced from bed and board, when long absent from one another, when sick and disabled, when one has an inveterate aversion to the other: they cannot marry another, but they can, and must use other remedies. Wi.  
**9** *If they do not contain.* This is spoken of such as are free; and not of such as by vow have given their first faith to God; to whom, if they will use proper means to obtain it, God will never refuse the gift of continency. Some translators have corrupted this text, by rendering it, *if they cannot contain.* Ch.  
**10** *But to them that are married*, &c. He tells these persons, that they ought not to part, or if a separation for weighty reasons can be allowed, neither party can marry another. Wi.—*That the wife.* Jesus Christ has expressly declared, that in one case only a divorce may be allowable, and that is in the case of adultery. Est.  
**12** **Ver.** **12–17** **.** *For to the rest*, &c. This was a case entirely new, which the wisdom of the apostle regulates according to the laws of charity. Tertul. thinks that some of the faithful, who had been converted from paganism, did not esteem it lawful to live any longer with their wives, who were yet buried in the superstitions of idolatry, which scruples S. Paul answers, guided as he was, by the particular lights of the Holy Ghost. Calmet.—*Not the Lord.* That is, it is the command of the Lord, for such even as are separated, not to marry to another, but when I advised the unmarried not to marry, this is a counsel, or advice, not a divine precept, which doctrine he repeats again before the end of this chap. v. 25. 28. 39.—*If any brother have a wife that believeth not*, &c. S. Paul speaks of two that were joined by a contract of marriage, when both of them were infidels, and that one of them is converted to the Christian faith: we do not read of any precept that Christ gave, as to those marriages, but the apostle seems to order by his apostolical authority, that they continue as man and wife, unless the party that remains still an infidel, will needs depart; then, says the apostle, *let* such an one *depar* *t.* There is also another case, to wit, when the man or woman remaining an infidel, will not live without continual injuries and blasphemies against God and the Catholic religion, so that there can be no *peace* on that account betwixt them. In these two cases, according to the canons of the Church, it is looked upon as no marriage, so that the party converted may marry another. And this seems grounded on the reason, which the apostle here gave, *that God hath called us in peace.* Wi.  
**14** **Ver.** **14–16** **.** *Is sanctified.* The meaning is not that the faith of the husband, or the wife is of itself sufficient to put the unbelieving party, or their children, in the state of grace and salvation: but that it is very often an occasion of their sanctification, by bringing them to the true faith. Ch.—Sanctification which has different significations, cannot here signify that an infidel is truly and properly sanctified, or justified, by being married to a faithful believer; therefore we can only understand an improper sanctification, so that such an infidel, though not yet converted, need not be looked upon as unclean, but in the dispositions of being converted, especially living peaceably together, and consenting that *their children* be baptized, by which they are truly *sanctified.*—*How knowest thou, O wife?* &c. These words seem to give the reason, why they may part, when they cannot live peaceably, and when there is little prospect that the party that is an infidel will be converted. Wi.  
**17** **. &c.** But [3] *as the Lord hath distributed, …* and *called every one*, &c. S. Paul proceeds to other points of discipline, that persons converted may remain and continue in the same employments, and lawful state of life as before, that it is nothing to the purpose, whether before his conversion he was a *circu* *mcised* Jew, or an *uncircumcised* Gentile, circumcision being no longer of obligation in the new law. If any one that is converted was a *bond-man*, or a slave, let him not be concerned at this, *but use i* *t rather*, [4] which many interpret, let him rather endeavour to be made free, though S. Chrys. and others understand, let him rather remain content with his servile condition. Perhaps it was an admonition to those new converts, who might imagine that their Christian liberty exempted them from being *servant of men.* However, he gives them this great comfort, that such *an one is the Lord’s free-man*, that is, whoever is a Christian, and in the grace of God; but he adds, let him not be a *slave to men*, that is, not follow their sinful ways, nor consent to any thing that is criminal. Wi.—All consists in doing the will of God, by loving him with our whole heart; without this, all is illusion. To attach ourselves to exterior practices contrary to the order of God, is the superstition of circumcision; to despise what comes from God, is the pride of uncircumcision.  
**23** *With a price.* Viz. with the price of the precious blood of Christ. Est.—Him only should we serve, for whatever draws us from this allegiance, is perfect servitude, such as the love of any person or thing out of God.  
**25** **Ver.** **25–28** **.** *Now concerning virgins*, &c. He turns his discourse again to the unmarried, who (if they have made no vow) may lawfully marry, though he is far from commanding every one to marry, as when he says, *seek not a wife.* And *such shall have tribulation of the flesh*, cares, troubles, vexations in the state of marriage, *but I spare you*, I leave you to your liberty of marrying, or not marrying, and will not discourage you be setting forth the crosses of a married life. Wi.  
**29** *The time is short*, &c. Incomparable instructions to the end of this chapter, which are not obscure. Wi.  
**30** *And they who weep.* In this passage the apostle teaches us, in the midst of our greatest afflictions not to suffer ourselves to be overwhelmed with grief, but to recollect that the time of this life is short, and that temporary pains will be recompensed with the never-fading joys of eternity. Est.  
**33** It is far easier to give our whole heart and application without any the least reserve to *God*, than to divide them without injustice.  
**36** *Let him do what he will, he sinneth not*, &c. The meaning is not as libertines would have it, that persons may do what they will, and not sin; provided they afterwards marry: but that the father with regard to the giving his virgin in marriage, may do as he pleaseth: and that it will be no sin to him if she marry. Ch.  
**38** **. &c.** *He that giveth her not, doth better.* And *more blessed shall she be, if she so remains, according to my counsel.* It is very strange if any one, who reads this chapter without prejudices, does not clearly see, that S. Paul advises, and prefers the state of virginity to that of a married life.—*I think that I also have the spiri* *t of God.* He puts them in mind, by this modest way of speaking, of what they cannot doubt of, as to so great an apostle. Wi.—It is worthy our notice, that S. Paul on every occasion avoids the least appearance of vanity, and frequently when delivering his own opinion, gives us only a hint, hoping that we shall supply the rest. Of this apostle’s modesty in this particular, we have many instances in his writings, as in v. 26. “I think, therefore, that this is good;” and likewise in chap. 4 v. 9. “For I think that God.” Estius.

## Chapter 8

**1** *Now concerning those things.* It appears from this whole passage that the Corinthians had, in a former letter, consulted this apostle, upon the subject of eating meats offered to idols. It was not unusual to reserve some part of the sacrifice of which they made a supper, either in their own family, with their friends, or sometimes even in the temple. Some of the Christians of Corinth attended without scruple at these sorts of feasts, and eat of the meats offered to idols; whilst others, on the contrary, took scandal at this conduct, and thought it a tacit approbation of idolatry. S. Paul being consulted upon this difficulty, gives them his advice in this chapter. Calmet.—*We know that we all have knowledge* about it. That is, all we, who are sufficiently instructed, have knowledge enough to be convinced, that *idols are nothing* in themselves, nor the meats offered to them better nor worse upon that account. Wi.—*Knowledge puffeth up*, &c. Knowledge, without charity and humility, serveth only to puff persons up. Ch.  
**4** *An idol is nothing.* The apostle seems to allude in this place to the Greek signification of this word, ειδωλον, signifying a false representation; as for instance in ghosts, which are said to appear sometimes at night. *Umbræ tenues, simulacra luce carentium* *.* Calmet.  
**5** *Many gods*, &c. Reputed for such among the heathens. Ch.  
**6** *To u* *s there is but one God, the Father; of whom all things, and we unto him.* Of or from the Father are all things, even the eternal Son and the Holy Ghost, though they are one and the same God with the Father.—*And one Lord Jesus Christ: by whom are all things, and we by him.* All things were created *by the Son* of God, the eternal and uncreated wisdom of the Father, from whom he proceeds from eternity, and also *by the* Holy Ghost, all creatures being equally the work of the three divine persons. The Arians and Socinians pretend from this place, that only the Father is truly and properly God. The Catholics answer, that he is called the God, *of whom all*, because from him always proceeded, do proceed, and shall always proceed the Son and the Holy Ghost, though one and the same God in nature, substance, &c. And that when he is called the *one God*, by these words are excluded the false gods of the heathens, not the Son, and the Holy Ghost, who are but one God with the Father. S. Chrys. also here observes, (hom. xx.) that if the two other persons are excluded, because the Father is called *one God*, by the same way of reasoning it would follow, that because Jesus Christ is called the *one Lord*, neither the Holy Ghost, nor even the Father, are the *one Lord*, whereas the Scriptures many times express the divine majesty, as well by the word Lord as by the word God. Wi.  
**7** *But knowledge is not* *in every one*, &c. The new converts, who had been Jews, thought that things which had been offered to idols were defiled, unclean, and could not be lawfully eaten: they who had been Gentiles looked upon them as victims offered to idols, in which there was some virtue of enchantment, &c. Their weak consciences judged they could not be lawfully eaten: and when they were induced to eat them by the example of others, it was still against their consciences. The infidels also might sometimes think that the Christians, in eating such things, honoured their idols; in such cases, they who were better instructed, were to abstain, not to give offence to weak consciences, and lest they should make them sin. And a weak brother *shall perish, for whom Christ died;* where we may learn, that Christ died also for those that *shall perish*, and not only for the predestinate. Wi.  
**8** **Ver.** **8–9** **.** *Meat doth not commend us to God.* It is an admonition to those, who because they knew that meats offered to idols were not worse, would not abstain, even when this scandalized the weak brethren: he tells them that eating or not eating of them, does not make them more acceptable to God, nor puts them to any inconvenience, since they may get other meats: therefore they ought not to make use *of their liberty*, when it proves a stumbling-block to the weak, and makes them sin. Wi.  
**10** *In the idol’s temple.* [1] It does not seem likely that any Christians would go to eat with idolaters in their very temples, of things offered to their idols: so that we may rather understand any place where infidels and Christians eat together, and where it happened that some meats were brought which had been first offered to idols, which the well-instructed Christians regarded not, nor asked any questions about, but the weak scrupled to eat them. Wi.—*Shall not his conscience.* The meaning of S. Paul’s words is this: Will not your weak brother, who is not endowed with so great a knowledge as you, be induced, from your example, to eat these meats offered to idols, believing that he will derive therefrom some benefit. Estius.  
**13** *If meat scandalize.* That is, if my eating cause my brother to sin. Ch.—Can we put any meat, or life itself, in competition with a soul, and the blood of Christ, which has been shed for that soul, when we know the value of each!

## Chapter 9

**1** **. &c.** *Am not I free?* The apostle in this place wishes to teach the Corinthians, how careful and solicitous they should be not to give cause for scandal to their neighbour, and how anxious for his spiritual welfare, informing them, that as he refused to take even what he had a just right to, as a minister of the altar, that is, to live by the altar, so they must do in like manner, abstaining even from things lawful, for the good of religion. Estius.—*Am not I an apostle?* &c. S. Paul here, to the 20th verse, answers those reflections, which the new preachers at Corinth made against him and Barnaby, as if they were only an inferior kind of apostles. To this he answers, that he had *seen Jesus Christ*, who appeared to him. He tells the Corinthians, that *they* at least, ought to respect him as their apostle, who had converted them. He tells them, that when any persons *ask about* his apostleship, he has this to say for himself, that he not only laboured as an apostle in converting them, but also laboured without taking of them what might supply him and his companions with necessaries, as *to meat* and *drink.* He insists upon this particular circumstance, to shew he did not preach Christ for gain-sake; and at the same time brings seven or eight proofs to shew that he, and all who preach the gospel, have a *power* and a right to be maintained with necessaries by them to whom the preach. 1. He had a title to be supplied with necessaries, as being an *apostle.* 2. And by them, as being their apostle. 3. By the example of *a soldier*, who has a right to be *paid:* of *a husbandma* *n*, who has a right to partake of the fruit of his labours: of *a shepherd*, nourished by the milk of the flock. v. 7. 4. He brings the example of those who *threshed*, or trode out the corn by oxen, as it was formerly the custom, that the threshers, nay even the *oxen*, when *treading out the corn*, were not to be *muzzled* according to the Scripture, (Deut. 25) but were to eat, and to be fed with the corn or straw; much more men that labour, are to be fed with the fruit of their labours. v. 8. 9. 10. 5. Nothing is more reasonable than to supply those with corporal and temporal things, who labour to procure spiritual and eternal blessings for others. v. 11. 6. They who preached to the Corinthians after S. Paul, were maintained by them; had not he and Barnaby as much right as they? v. 12. 7. He shews it by the examples of the ministers and priests in the law of Moses, who had a share of the sacrifices and victims offered, and who, serving the altar, lived by the altar. v. 13. 8. He brings the authority of our Saviour, Christ, who said to his apostles, (Matt. 10:10) *that a labourer is worthy of his meat*, or of *his reward, as it is said*, Lu. 10:7. But S. Paul puts them in mind, (v. 15) *that he* *did not make use of* his right, as to *any of these things:* that he does not write in this manner, to get or have any thing of them hereafter: nay, he makes warm protestations, says S. Chrys. [1] that he will take nothing of them; that he will preach *without putting* others to *any cost;* (v. 18) that he will accept of nothing, lest thereby *he put any obstacle to the gospel*, or gave any person occasion to say he preached for gain. He tells them, *it is better for him to die*, than, by taking any thing of them, to *make void* this, which he has to *glory in*, and to justify himself against his backbiting adversaries: the sense is, that he is willing to spend his life as well as his labours among them, sooner than in these circumstances receive any temporal reward from them. Yet when the circumstances were different, he received of the Philippians (Philip. 4:15) enough to supply him in his necessities. He also tells them here, that he does not pretend to glory of boast for *having preached:* this being *a necessary* duty.—*For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward.* The sense seems to be, if I do this office cheerfully, and with a right intention to please God only, I shall have a copious reward prepared for such a labourer: *if unwillingly*, and imperfectly, and not with a pure intention, I cannot expect such a reward; though *still a dispensing of it is entrusted to me;* that is, it is always my duty to preach. Others, *by willingly*, understand the doing of it in so perfect a manner, as not to receive any thing, and *unwillingly*, when they would scarce do it, at least so zealously, unless they received what would maintain them. Wi.  
**5** It appears certain, from the testimony of the fathers, that S. Paul was not in the state of wedlock. S. Jerom informs us that the apostle is here speaking of such holy women who, according to the Jewish custom, supplied their teachers with the necessaries of life, as we see was done to Christ himself. It is evident from ancient records that this was a very prevalent custom in Judea, and therefore a cause of no scandal; but to the Gentiles this custom was unknown, and therefore lest it might prove a cause of scandal to any, S. Paul did not allow any woman to follow him as a companion. Tertul. denies, with S. Aug. and S. Jerom, that S. Paul is here speaking of his wife. Estius, Calmet.—*A woman, a sister.* [2] Some erroneous translators have corrupted this text, by rendering it, *a sister, a wife;* whereas it is certain, S. Paul had no wife, (c. 7 v. 7. 8) and that he only speaks of such devout women, as according to the custom of the Jewish nation, waited upon the preachers of the gospel, and supplied them with necessaries. Ch.—And to what end could he talk of burthening the Corinthians with providing for his *wife*, when he himself clearly affirmeth that he was single? C. 7 v. 7. and 8. This all the Greek fathers affirm, with S. Aust. de op. Monach. c. iv. S. Jer. adv. Jovin. c. xiv. &c. &c.  
**11** *Is it a great matter?* The apostle is here speaking of what he had given to the Corinthians, and what he had received from them; and this he does under the comparison of the sower and the reaper. Can any of you think it hard that we receive some part of your *temporal* goods, when we have bestowed upon you *spiritual:* nevertheless, we have not used this power, but we bear all things, &c. v. 12. Estius.  
**16** *It is no glory.* That is, I have nothing to glory of. Ch.—If I preach the gospel through compulsion, fear, or mere necessity, having no other means of maintenance, I must not look for a reward in heaven; but now doing it through charity and freely, I shall have my reward from God; and the more abundant the charity, the greater the reward. S. Aug. de Op. Mor. i. 5.  
**17** *But if against my will.* That is, if I do not do it with alacrity and zeal, but instigated by the sole motive of punishment, wo unto me, as he says in the preceding verse, if I am instigated by this motive alone; still the dispensation of the gospel is entrusted to me, and I must comply with that obligation, either with the zeal and alacrity of a son, or for fear of punishment, as a slave. Estius.  
**19** *Free as to all.* That is, whereas I was under no obligation to any man, yet I made myself the servant of all, &c. Calmet.  
**20** *I became to the Jews as a Jew.* That is, upon occasions, not to hinder their conversion, I practised the ceremonies of their law; though I am *not under their law*, which is no longer obligatory, but only *under the new law of Christ.* Wi.  
**21** *To them that were without the law.* That is, to the Gentiles, who never were under the law of Moses. Wi.  
**23** How convincing is this and many similar texts against those who deny the merit of good works, and who would not have men to act with a view to any recompense, though rewards and recompenses are very frequently mentioned in holy writ. A.  
**24** *Know you not?* Nothing is more famous in the annals of history than the public games in Greece: it is to these the apostle is here alluding. Calmet.—*All run indeed*, &c. He brings the examples of runners and wrestlers for a prize in the Grecian games, where only one could gain the prize. It is true in our case many obtain the crown for which we strive, but every one is in danger of losing it, and so must use all his endeavours to *obtain it.* Wi.  
**25** He *refraineth himself*, &c. Curbs his inclinations, abstains from debauchery, or any thing that may weaken him, or hinder him from gaining this corruptible crown, how much more ought we to practise self-denials for an eternal crown? In the fifth verse, where we translate, *a woman, a sister*, or *a sister, a woman:* the Prot. translation has *a sister, a wife.* We have reason to reject this translation, since it is evident by this epistle, that S. Paul at least then had not a wife, c. 7 v. 7. 8. And the ancient interpreters expressly examined and rejected this translation. See S. Jerom against Jovian. l. i. tom. 4. part 2. p. 167. edit. Ben. S. Aug. l. de opere Monach. tom. vi. c. 4. p. 478. Nov. edit. The Greek word, as every one knows, signifies either a woman or a wife. Nor doth any thing here determine it to signify a wife. He speaks of a woman, or of women that were sisters, that is, Christians; so that a sister expounds what kind of woman it was. Dr. Hammond puts in the margin *a sister-woman*, as it were to correct the Prot. translation. Wi.  
**27** *I chastise*, &c. Here S. Paul shews the necessity of self-denial and mortification to subdue the flesh, and its inordinate desires. Ch.—Not even the labours of an apostle are exemptions from voluntary mortification and penance.

## Chapter 10

**1** **Ver.** **1–2** **.** *Our Fathers*, the Jews, *were all under the cloud.* He means, when God conducted the camp of the Israelites, in the day-time by a cloud, and in the night by a pillar of fire. Ex. 13:21. Wi.—*In Moses.* Under the conduct of Moses they received baptism in figure, by passing under the cloud and through the sea: and they partook of the body and blood of Christ in figure, by eating of the *manna*, (called here a *spiritual food*, because it was a figure of the true bread which comes down from heaven) and drinking the water miraculously brought out of the rock, called here a *spirit* *ual rock;* because it was also a figure of Christ. Ch.—*Were baptized in the cloud, and in the sea*, figuratively, these being figures of baptism in the new law. As Moses, who delivered them from the slavery of Egypt, was figure of Christ, who came to deliver mankind from the slavery of sin. Wi.  
**3** **Ver.** **3–4** **.** *All eat the same spiritual food*, to wit, the *manna*, which seemed to come from heaven, and was a figure of the eucharist, the spiritual food of our souls.—*All drank the same spiritual drink*, and … *rock that followed them*, by which is understood the stream of water, that came miraculously out of the rock struck by Moses, and which is said to have followed them, because it ran plentifully through their camp.—*And the rock was Christ*, a figure of Christ; for *all these things* (v. 11) *happened to t* *hem in figure.* Wi.  
**5** *God was not well pleased*, &c. Of 600,000, only Josue and Caleb entered the land of promise; the rest were *destroyed*, and perished in *the wilderness.* Their punishment ought to be an admonition to all to avoid such sins of idolatry, fornication, murmuring, &c.  
**6** *In a figure of us.* That is, this was done and written to teach us, what we may expect, if we imitate the murmurs, infidelities, ingratitude, and disobedience of the Hebrew people. Unless we renounce our irregular desires, unless we mortify our passions, baptism and communion will prove our greater condemnation. The greatest graces are but subjects of alarm, unless our life correspond with them.  
**9** *As some of them tempted* Christ. This cannot but be understood of Christ, as God. Wi.  
**11** *Upon w* *hom the ends of the world are come.* The last age of the world, which S. John calls the *last hour.* Wi.  
**12** *Take heed lest he fall.* This regards the doctors and teachers in the new Church of Corinth; who, relying upon their own learning, did not think themselves weak, and presuming too much upon their own strength, exposed themselves to the danger of falling. See S. Chrys. and S. Aug. de dono. Persev.—Self-diffidence is the foundation of our strength. We prevent many dangerous falls when we keep close to the earth by humility.  
**13** *Let no temptation* [1] *take hold on you.* Or, *no temptatio* *n hath taken hold of you*, or come upon you as yet, but what is human, or incident to man. Ch.—The sense of these words is obscure: we may expound them by way of prayer, let no temptation, but such as are of human frailty, and not hard to be overcome, happen to you. See the Greek text.—*Will make also with temptation issue, that you may be able to bear it.* The literal signification of the Latin, compared with the Greek is, that God will bring you off, and make you escape out of those dangers, when you are tempted. Wi.—The most violent temptations are occasions of merit and triumph to such as are in the hands of God; whilst the lightest are snares and a deep abyss to such as are in their own hands.  
**14** There are various kinds of idolatry. It is the perfection of Angels never to err: it is a human imperfection to fall into error, but a diabolical crime, so to love our error, as to divide the Church by schism, or leave it by heresy: this love of self is the most dangerous idolatry.  
**16** **Ver** **.** **16** **.** *The chalice of benediction*, [2] &c. Which the priests bless or consecrate, *is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? And the bread which we break*, (so called because of the outward appearance of bread) *is it not the partaking* or communion *of the body of the Lord?* See S. Chrys. here, hom. xxiv. p. 396. and p. 400. See also the Annotations, Matt. 26:26. Wi.—Here the apostle puts them in mind of the partaking of the body and blood of Christ in the sacred mysteries, and becoming thereby one mystical body with Christ. From whence he infers, (v. 21) that they who are made partakers with Christ, by the eucharistic sacrifice, and sacrament, must not be made partakers with devils, by eating of the meats sacrificed to them. Ch.  
**17** *We being many, are one bread.* Or, as it may be rendered, agreeably both to the Latin and Greek, *because the bread is one, all we, being many, are one body, who partake of that one bread.* For it is by our communicating with Christ and with one another, in this blessed Sacrament, that we are formed into one mystical body; and made, as it were, one bread, compounded of many grains of corn, closely united together. Ch.—From the sacrament of the real body of Christ in the eucharist, he passeth to the effect of this sacrament, which is to unite all those who partake of it, as members of the same mystical body of Christ, which is his Church: and from hence he presently draws this consequence, that such as are members of that body, of which Christ is the head, cannot have any communication with idolaters, or with those that offer sacrifices to idols and devils. Wi.  
**18** *Behold Israel, according to the flesh.* That is, the people that were the offspring of Israel or Jacob. *Are not* these they who offered sacrifices to the true God, *and eat* of *the sacrifices*, which were offered on his altars, and by offering to him such sacrifices, acknowledged him to be their God, and the only true God: and so you, if you partake, and eat of the sacrifices of idolaters, and of what they tell you was offered to their idols, you seem at least, to join with them in acknowledging, and paying a reverence to their idols, which are devils: and you cannot *be p* *artakers of the table of the Lord, and of the table of devils.*—*Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?* that is, how dare we provoke our Lord, who is a jealous God, and will admit of no rival, by partaking of sacrifices offered to false gods? how dare we thus contemn his power, as if we were *stronger* than he, or that he could not punish us? Wi.  
**19** *What then? do I say*, &c. He puts this objection, as if it were contradictory to what he had taught before, (c. 8 v. 4) *that an idol is nothing*, &c. but he answers this objection by saying that *all things*, that is, all meats *are lawful* in themselves, but not always expedient, nor *edifying*, when they give scandal to weak brethren, or when the infidels themselves think that such as eat things offered to idols, join with them in honouring their idols. Wi.—The meaning of this passage is: whilst I advise you to abstain from eating of any thing consecrated to idols, I do not advise you as supposing that these offerings have any power in themselves to defile your souls, in the same manner as by eating of the body and blood of Christ we receive strength to overcome our spiritual enemies. S. Paul here anticipates an objection that might be made by some to whom he was writing. Est.  
**21** In all this discourse, a comparison is instituted between the Christian host and oblation, its effects, conditions and properties, with the altars, hosts, sacrifices and immolations of the Jews and Gentiles; which the apostle could not have done, had there not been a proper sacrifice in the Christian worship. The holy Fathers teach the same with the ancient Councils. Thus in the council of Nice: *The lamb of God laid upon the altar.* Conc. Ephes. *The unbloody service of the sacrifice.* In S. Cyril Alex. in Conc. Ephes. Anath. 11. *The quickening holy sac* *rifice; the unbloody host and victim.* Tertul. de coron. milit. *The propitiatory sacrifice both for the living and the dead.* This Melchisedech did most singularly prefigure in his mystical oblation of bread and wine; this also according to the prophecy of Malachy, shall continue from the rising to the setting sun, a perpetual substitute for all the Jewish sacrifices; and this, in plain terms, is called the Mass, by S. Augustin, Serm. ccli. 91. Conc. Cartha. ii. c. 3. 4. c. 84. Milevit. 12. S. Leo, ep. 81. 88. c. 2. S. Gregory, l. ii. ep. 9. 92. &c. &c. See next chap. v. 24.  
**23** *All things* *are lawful.* This is the same sentiment he has expressed in chap. 6 v. 12. and in chap. 8 v. 8, 9 wherein he teaches us, that on some occasions it is necessary to abstain even from things in themselves lawful, as in the case of meats consecrated to idols. Calmet.—Two excellent rules that can serve as guides on these occasions, are the edification of the Church, and the spiritual good of our neighbour. Without the aid of these guides, we go astray ourselves and decoy others, in doing what the letter of the law permits, but what the spirit of the law, charity, forbids.  
**27** *Eat of any thing*, &c. Here at length S. Paul prescribes them a rule by which they were to govern themselves, as to meats that they met with. Buy and eat any thing sold in the market, or of any thing that you meet with at the table of infidels, when they invite you, for all *are the Lord’s* creatures, and may be taken *with thanksgiving*, as we ought to take whatsoever we eat.—But *if any man say, this hath been sacrific* *ed to idols, do not eat of it for his sake*, &c. And why must they not then eat of it? because either he is an infidel that says it: and then by saying so, he may mean that they who eat it, ought to eat it in honour of their gods. Or if a weak brother says so, he thereby signifies, that his conscience judges it not lawful to be eaten; so that in one case, you seem to consent that things are to be taken in honour of idols: in the other, you give offence to your weak brother: and I would have you to be without *offence*, both to *Jews* and *Gentiles;* and not to think it enough that you can eat such things with thanksgiving. It may be asked here why the apostle should not absolutely forbid them ever to eat any thing offered to idols, as this seems a thing absolutely forbidden in the council of Jerusalem? Acts 15:23. To this some answer, that the apostle here expounds the true sense of that decree, which was only to be understood, when eating such meats gave scandal. Others say, the prohibition was only for a short time, and now was out of date. Others take notice, that the prohibition was not general, nor for all places, but only for the new converted Gentiles that were at Antioch, or in Syria and Cilicia, as specified in the decree. Wi.  
**29** *For why is my liberty?* The meaning of this passage is, that though we ought, on some occasions, to abstain from things in themselves lawful, yet, that on other occasions we are by no means obliged to it, particularly when our brother is not thoroughly instructed on that head. Theo.

## Chapter 11

**2** *I praise you.* That is, a great many of you. Wi.  
**3** *The head of the wo* *man is the man*, &c. To have the head covered at public meetings, is, according to S. Paul, a mark of subjection: The man was created to be *head* over the woman, who was made subject to the man, being *m* *ade* of him, of his rib, and the woman *made for him*, not he *for the woman.* The man in a special manner, is the *image of God*, not only by his immortal soul, in which sense also the woman was made to God’s image, and likeness, but inasmuch as God gave him a power over all creatures, and so he is called, *the glory of God.* For these reasons, as well as from a received custom, S. Paul tells every woman, that in prayer or prophesying in public meetings, she must have her head veiled, and covered in testimony of her subjection to man, her head, otherwise she dishonours herself, and her head. This is what he tells her, (v. 10) that she ought *to have a power over her head*, [1] that is, to have a veil or covering, as a mark of man’s power over her: and *because of the angels*, that is, out of a respect to the angels there present. Some understand the priests and ministers of God, called angels, particularly in the Apocalypse. S. Paul adds, that *nature* [2] having given to women long hair, designed it to be as a natural veil. In fine, he appeals to them, to be judges, whether it be not unbecoming in women to pray without a veil. But he will have men to be uncovered, and not to bear such a mark of subjection, as a veil is, by which a man would dishonour his head, that is, himself, and Christ, who is his head, and who appointed him, when he created him, to be head over the woman. He looks upon it as a dishonour and a disgrace for men to nourish their hair, as women should do. He also calls *God the head of Christ*, that is, of Christ, as man. Lest he should seem to lessen the condition of women more than necessary, he adds, that the propagation of mankind now depends on the woman, as well as on the man, seeing every *man is by the woman.* Wi.  
**4** *Praying or prophesying.* By prophesying, in this place is meant, reading publicly in the Church, or singing, or explaining some part of the Scripture. To have the head covered, or uncovered, is in itself a thing very indifferent. Amongst the Greeks it was the custom always to sacrifice to their idols with heads uncovered; amongst the Romans, the opposite was the fashion, and among the Jews, as well formerly as at present, they always appear in their synagogues with heads covered. Calmet.  
**10** *A power:* That is, a veil or covering, as a sign that she is under the *power* of her husband: and this, the apostle adds, *because of the angels*, who are present in the assemblies of the faithful. Ch.  
**16** *If any man seem to be contentious* about this matter, or any other, *we have no such custom, nor hath the Church;* that is, says S. Chrys. to have such quarrels and divisions. Or, as others understand it, we have no such custom for women to be in the Church uncovered. Wi.  
**17** In this chapter are three instructions: 1. That women must have a veil on their heads at public prayers, to ver. 17.—2dly, he corrects the abuses in their banquets of charity, called *Agape*, to ver. 23.—3dly, he teaches that in the sacrament of the holy Eucharist, is the body and blood of Christ. Wi.  
**17** *Now this I ordain*, &c. S. Paul found that several abuses had crept in among the Corinthians at their Church meetings, where before the holy mysteries (though S. Chrys. thinks after them) they used to have those *charitable suppers*, called the *Agape.* For as our Saviour eat first a common supper with his apostles, before he instituted the holy sacrament, so the Christians in many places brought meats with them, and eat a supper together, in token of that friendship and union, which they had with all their brethren, before they began to celebrate the holy mysteries. It is this supper, which according to the common interpretation S. Paul here (v. 20) calls the *Lord’s supper*, [3] (though S. Aug. and some others by the *Lord’s supper*, understand the holy sacrament itself of Christ’s body and blood.) The apostle tells them, he *hears there are divisions* *among them* at their meetings, which he says will happen, as there *must be also heresies*, which God permits, that *they who are approved, may be made manifest*, that is, that on such occasions, the just may shew their fidelity and constancy in their duty to God. The apostle tells them, that *it is not now to eat the Lord’s supper*, that is, there were such abuses among them, that it was not now to imitate the supper, which Christ made with his apostles, or, according to the exposition of S. Aug. this was not becoming persons, who, before the end of their meetings, were to partake of the divine mysteries. Wi.  
**19** *There must be also heresies:* By reason of the pride and perversity of man’s heart; not by God’s will or appointment; who nevertheless draws good out of this evil, manifesting, by that occasion, who are the good and firm Christians, and making their faith more remarkable. Ch.—Not that God hath directly so appointed, as necessary: this originates in man’s malice, and his sole pride, and great abuse of free-will. The providence of God draweth good out of evil, but *wo to the man*, says the Scripture, *by whom scandal cometh*, such as sects and heresies. Hence S. Augustin, c. viii. de vera relig. says: “Let us use heretics not so as to approve their errors, but to make us more wary and vigilant, and more strenuous in defending Catholic doctrine against their deceits.”  
**20** *The Lord’s supper.* So the apostle here calls the *charity feasts* observed by the primitive Christians; and reprehends the abuses of the Corinthians on these occasions: which were the more criminal, because these feasts were accompanied with the celebrating the eucharistic sacrifice and sacrament. Ch.  
**21** *Every one taketh before his own supper to eat.* The sense seems to be, that he took and brought with him, what he designed to eat with others, and give at that supper: but as soon as some were met (without staying for others, as he orders them, v. 33. when he again speaks of these suppers) the rich placing themselves together, began this supper, and did not take with them their poor brethren, who had brought nothing, or had nothing to bring; by this means, *one indeed is hungry, and anot* *her is drunk*, that is, had at least drunk plentifully, while the poor had nothing but shame, and *confusion.* By this means of eating and drinking without temperance and moderation, they were by no means disposed to receive afterwards the holy Eucharist. He tells such persons that committed these disorders, that if they be so hungry that they cannot fast, they should eat (v. 34.) before they come from home. We find these Agape forbidden to be made in the Churches, in the 28th canon of the council of Laodicea, a little before the general council of Nice. In S. Chrys.’s time, and from the first ages, every one received the sacrament of the holy eucharist fasting, as it is probable this was one of the things which S. Paul gave *orders* about, (v. 34.) when he came to Corinth. We must not imagine, that because Christ instituted the holy sacrament, and gave it to his apostles after he had supped with them, that the apostles, or the pastors of the Church, their successors, could not order it to be received *fasting*, and *kneeling*, for greater reverence and devotion. See S. Aug. on this same subject, in his letter to Januarius, liv. tom. 2. part 2. p. 126. Nov. edit. He says, that though it is evident the apostles did not receive the body and blood of Christ fasting, yet we must not on that account calumniate, or blame the universal Church, in which it is received only by those who are fasting. He says, it is most insolent madness to dispute against what is a custom in the universal Church. Wi.  
**23** *I have received of the Lord.* That is, by revelation from Christ, as well as from others, who were present with him, *that which also I delivered to you* by word of mouth, &c. Here he speaks of the holy sacrament itself, of the words of consecration, as the evangelists had done, and of the real presence of Christ’s body and blood.—*Which shall be delivered for you.* In the common Greek copies, *which is broken for you*, to wit, on the cross.—*You shall shew the death of the Lord.* As *ofte* *n as* you receive, it shall be with a devout and grateful remembrance of his sufferings and death for your sake. He puts every one in mind, that whosoever *shall eat this bread*, (v. 27) so called from the outward appearances, *or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall*, by such a sacrilege, *be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.* And (v. 29) that *he eateth, and drinketh judgment*, or condemnation *to himself, not discerning* the difference betwixt celestial food and other meats, and not considering it to be truly *the body of the Lord.* See S. Chrys. hom. xxvii. If the words of our Saviour, *this is my body*, &c. were to be understood in a *metaphorical* and *figurative sense only*, is it probable that S. Paul, writing twenty-four years afterwards, to the new converted Gentiles at Corinth, would have used words, which full as clearly express a true and real presence of Christ’s body in the eucharist, without one word to signify that this was to be understood in a figurative sense only? Wi.  
**24** Juvenius, a native of Spain, and a priest, who flourished under Constantine the Great, about the year 329, has left us the life of Christ in hexameter verse, where speaking of the institution of the eucharist, he says, “Christ taught his disciples, that he delivered to them his own body;” and when he gave them the chalice, “he taught them that he had distributed to them his blood: and said, this blood remits the sins of the people: drink this, it is mine.” Bibl. Max. P. P. T. iv. p. 74.  
**27** *Or drink.* Here erroneous translators corrupted the text, by putting *and drink* (contrary to the original, η πινη) instead of *or dr* *ink.*—*Guilty of the body*, &c. *not discerning the body*, &c. This demonstrates the real presence of the body and blood of Christ, even to the unworthy communicant; who otherwise could not be *guilty of th* *e body and blood of Christ*, or justly condemned for *not discerning the Lord’s body.* Ch.—The real presence in the sacrament is also proved by the enormity of the crime, in its profanation. See S. Chrys. hom. de non contem. ec. and hom. lx. and lxi. ad pop. Antioch. where he shews that the unworthy receiver imitates the Jews in crucifying Jesus, and trampling under foot his sacred blood. Hence the dreadful punishments we read of in verses 27 and 30.  
**28** *Drink of the chalice.* This is not said by way of command, but by way of allowance, viz. where and when it is agreeable to the practice and discipline of the Church. Ch.  
**30** **Ver.** **30–32** **.** *Therefore* in punishment of the sin of receiving unworthily, many *are infirm*, visited with infirmities, even that bring death, which is meant by those words, *m* *any sleep.* But it is a mercy of God, when he only punishes by sickness, or a corporal death, and does not permit us to perish for ever, or *be condemned with this wicked world.* To avoid this, *let a man* *prove himself*, examine the state of his conscience, especially before he receives the holy sacrament, confess his sins, and be absolved by those to whom Christ left the power of forgiving sins in his name, and by his authority. If *we judge* ourselves in this manner, we shall not *be judged*, that is, condemned. Wi.

## Chapter 12

**1** *Concerning spiritual things.* In the apostle’s time, the Christians in the sacraments of baptism and confirmation, many times received those graces and gifts of the Holy Ghost, by which some of them *prophesied*, others wrought *miracles*, and cured diseases, others spoke *tongues*, and different languages: now some among the Corinthians made not a right use of these gifts, especially they who had the *gift of tongues*, and made use of it through vanity, rather than for the profit of others. Wi.  
**2** *You went to dumb idols.* He speaks to the Gentiles before their conversion, to put them in mind, how much happier they are by receiving the faith of Christ, and such graces and favours from God. Wi.  
**3** *No man, speaking by the Spirit of God*, &c. He tells them, if they see a person moved in an extraordinary manner, and say *anathema*, curse, or speak ill of Jesus, such an one cannot be moved by a good spirit. And *no man can say, the Lord Jesus*, that is, praise Christ as he ought, but by a good spirit. Wi.  
**4** **Ver.** **4–7** **.** *There are diversities of graces.* Lit. *divisions of graces;* but all from the *same spirit*, from the *same Lord*, from the *same God:* and all these gifts are designed, and to be made use of for the *profit* of the faithful. Wi.—S. Justin Mar. S. Irenæus, and Origen bear testimony, that these special gifts of the Holy Ghost were not unusual in their time. S. Paul, in order to curb the vanity of such as seemed to be a little puffed up with the gifts they had received, and likewise to comfort those who had received no such spiritual and extraordinary favours, wishes to teach both parties, that the same Holy Spirit distributes these graces according as they are more conducive to the welfare of his Church, and the glory of God. Calmet.  
**8** **, &c.** *Word of w* *isdom*, which differs from that of *knowledge*, inasmuch as *wisdom* is a more eminent and sublime knowledge. These are numbered among the gifts of the Holy Ghost. Isaias, c. 11.—*To another faith*, by which, says S. Chrys., [1] is not here meant a belief of revealed truths, but an humble confidence of working miracles, grounded on faith, and on the power and goodness of God.—*The same Spirit worketh, divi* *ding to every one according as he will;* by which words, they that valued themselves on the gifts of *prophesying*, and *speaking tongues*, are put in mind, that all these were purely the gifts of God, to whom alone the honour is due. Wi.  
**12** **. &c.** *As the body is one*, &c. From this comparison of the mystical body of Christ, that is, of his Church, to a man’s natural body, he brings excellent instructions. 1. That as all members and parts, make up the same body, *so also is Christ;* that is, so it is in the Church of Christ, which is his mystical body. 2. As all the parts of man’s body are enlivened by the same soul, so all in the Church have their life from the same Spirit of God in baptism, and in the sacraments instituted by our Saviour, Christ; in which we *are made to drink of the same spir* *it.* 3. As all the members, that have such different offices and functions, do but constitute one complete body, so is it in the Church of Christ. 4. As those that seem the less considerable parts of the human body, are no less necessary for the subsistence and harmony of the whole, and stand in need of one another, (for example, the head stands in need of the feet) so in the Church, &c. 5. He takes notice, that in a natural body, the less *honourable*, the baser, and as they are called, the *uncomely parts*, are clothed with greater care and decency, Lit. *have a more abundant honour bestowed upon* *them*, so in the mystical body, no less, but even a greater care is to be taken of the weaker, and more infirm members, of the poor, the weak, the ignorant; and in the spirit of charity and love, that there may be no divisions or *schisms*, but a brotherly union: that if *one suffer*, another compassionate and assist him, &c. Wi.  
**15** *If the foot*, &c. By this comparison S. Paul teaches the Corinthians, that as all cannot exercise the same functions in the Church, so no one should be envious of his brother; but that by their mutual charity, co-operation, union of hearts, and faith, they should compose one body, of which Christ is the head. Calmet.  
**24** Cicero, in his 1st liber de Off. speaking of the human body, says, Natura quæ formam nostram atque figuram, in qua esset species honesta, eam posuit in promptu; quæ partes autem corporis ad naturæ necessitatem datæ, aspectum essent deformem habituræ atque turpem, eas contexit atque abdidit. Calmet.  
**27** *Members of member.* [2] The sense seems to be, you are members of the particular Church of Corinth, which is only a part or member of the whole body of the Christian Catholic Church. This is agreeable to the common reading in the Greek, where it is said, *you are members of a part.* See S. Chrys. hom. xxxii. Wi.  
**28** *First apostles*, &c. Here he sets down these gifts or graces in their order of dignity. 1. *The apostles*, blessed above others with all kinds of graces. 2. *Prophets*, who had the gift of interpreting of prophecies, and of knowing things to come. 3. *Doctors*, or teachers of the gospel, preferred before those who had the gift of *miracles*, or of *healing* the infirm, and before the *gifts of tongues*, which they valued and esteemed so much, which he reckons in a manner in the last place, except that of *interpreting*, which is wanting in the present Greek copies. But as *interpreting* is found in all the Greek MSS. (v. 30) we have reason to prefer the reading of the Latin Vulgate. Wi.  
**31** *Be zealous for the be* *tter gifts:* which are to be more or less esteemed, as they are accompanied with charity, as he is going to *shew* in the next chapter. Wi.

## Chapter 13

**1** *A tinkling cymbal.* Which may give notice, and be beneficial to others, but not to itself. Wi.—Without charity, both towards every individual, and especially towards the common body of the Church, none of the aforesaid gifts will be available. B.  
**2** **Ver.** **2–3** **.** These prove that faith without good works, and especially charity for God and our neighbour, cannot avail to eternal life; faith and charity are both essentially necessary. Hence S. Augustin declares, that where there is not true faith, there cannot be justice; because the just man liveth by faith: and where charity is not, there can be no justice, which if they had, they would never tear in pieces the body of Christ, which is the Church. De fid. ad Pet. c. xxxix.  
**4** *Charity … dealeth not perversely.* [1] The Greek word here seems taken from the Latin. S. Chrys. expounds it, is not rash, but acteth prudently and considerately. Others, it is not light or inconstant. Others, it *braggeth*, or *vaunteth not*, as in the Prot. translation. Wi.  
**5** *Is not ambitious;* [2] which is also the sense of some Greek copies, but in others, and in S. Chrys. it signifies, it is not ashamed of any one. Wi.  
**8** *Prophecies* and *tongues* last no longer than this life.—*Knowledge shall be destroyed*, that is, that imperfect knowledge we have in this world. For now we *know* only *in part*, we only see, as it were, through a *glass*, and imperfectly.—*Faith*, which is of things *that appear not*, and *hope*, which is of things that we enjoy not, will *cease* in heaven, but *charity*, the greater, or *greatest* even of *these* three, will remain, and be increased in heaven. Wi.  
**10** S. Aug. proves from this text, that the saints in heaven have a more perfect knowledge of what passes here below, than when they sojourned on earth. De Civit. Dei. l. xxii. c. 29.  
**11** *When I was a child.* I, like you, formerly judged of the goodness and excellency of these spiritual gifts by the advantages the procured; but after the Almighty had bestowed upon me his particular light, my opinion was far otherwise. Prophecy, and the gifts of languages are certainly very estimable gifts, yet charity is much more excellent. Calmet.—It is by charity we approach near to God, that we become his true image. Can we, then, wonder at the magnificent praises, glorious prerogatives, and surprising effects S. Paul gives to this all necessary virtue?

## Chapter 14

**1** *But rather that you may prophesy.* That is, declare or expound the mysteries of faith. Ch.—To prophesy, in its proper signification, is to foretell things to come: it sometimes is to expound the obscure places in other prophets; and sometimes it is to preach the word of God. Here it is chiefly taken in this last sense. Wi.  
**2** *He th* *at speaketh in a tongue*, which others at least understand not: nay, which sometimes, perhaps, by the 14th and 15th ver. he himself that spoke tongues, did not understand, can only be said to speak to God. In *spirit he speaketh mysteries*, edifies himself, because in his spirit he is piously and devoutly affected; but he must endeavour that the Church, or people present, may be also edified. Let him then pray for the other gift of *interpreting*, what he speaks, or let another interpret. Wi.—*Not to men.* Viz. so as to be *heard*, that is, so as to be understood by them. Wi.  
**6** If *I come to you,* *speaking with tongues* in this manner, *what shall I profit you*, unless *in revelation*, &c. that is, unless I reveal, and expound to you the meaning, by some other gift, as *in knowledge, in prophecy, in* *doctrine?* To speak tongues only without interpreting, is no ways instructive. He that speaks to me, what I understand not, is no better than *a barbarian to me*, (so the Greeks called those that spoke not their language.) He amplifies this inconvenience of not being understood, by the example of instruments, pipes, harps, trumpets, which would not move persons to different affections, nor excite them to different actions, unless the sound, and manner they were played upon, were different; seek, then, and endeavour to make use of the gifts of the Spirit, to the *edification of the Church*, or of the hearers. Wi.  
**12** *Of spirits.* Of spiritual gifts. Ch.  
**13** *Pray that he may interpret.* In order that he may be rendered more useful to the Church, as the martyrs, who prayed for those particular gifts they saw would be most useful for themselves, or their neighbours. Calm.  
**14** *If I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is without fruit:* it may signify without fruit, or profit to others, though some understand, as if by this gift of tongues, they sometimes spoke what they themselves did not understand. Wi.  
**16** *How shall he that holdeth the place of the un* *learned* (lit. an idiot) *say Amen to thy blessing?* When persons speak, or pray, and the ignorant have had no instruction concerning such prayers, they cannot know when to say Amen: and when infidels come into such meetings, where they hear many persons at once speaking many tongues, which are understood by no body, will they not be apt to say, *you are mad?* The like in a manner happened on the day of Pentecost, when the disciples having received this gift, and speaking with tongues, the people hearing them, cried out, they *were drunk.* Acts 2:13. Yet S. Chrys. takes notice, that the fault and madness was in the hearers, not in those who spoke tongues. hom. xxxvi. Wi.—*Amen.* The unlearned not knowing that you are then blessing, will not be qualified to join with you by saying Amen to your blessing. The use or abuse of strange tongues, of which the apostle here speaks, does not regard the public liturgy of the Church, (in which strange tongues were never used) but certain conferences of the faithful, (v. 26. &c.) in which, meeting together, they discovered to one another their various miraculous gifts of the Spirit, common in those primitive times; amongst which the apostle prefers that of prophesying before that of speaking strange tongues, because it was more to the public edification. Where also note, that the Latin, used in our liturgy, is so far from being a strange or unknown tongue, that it is perhaps the best known tongue in the world. Ch.  
**19** *But in the Church.* The apostle here condemns the vanity of the Corinthians, who made a parade of their gift of tongues. Calmet.  
**20** **Ver.** **20–22** **.** *Tongues are for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers*, according to what the law (under which he comprehends the prophet Isaias, 28:11) said: *In other tongues, and other lips, I* *will speak to this people: and neither so will they hear me.* S. Paul here gives the sense, rather than the words of the prophet, and expounds them of what happened particularly on the day of Pentecost, when the miraculous gift of tongues was designed to strike the unbelieving people with admiration, and to bring them afterwards to the true faith: but when he adds, that *tongues are not for the beli* *evers, and that prophecies are not for the unbelievers*, he cannot mean that tongues, used with discretion, may not also be profitable to believers, or that prophecies and instructions may not also be profitable to unbelievers, as well as to the believers; for this would be to contradict what he teaches in this chapter, and particularly (v. 24) where he says, that by prophecy the infidel is *convinc* *ed*, &c. S. Paul, whose design in all this chapter is to regulate the meetings, that they may be conducted with greater edification, and for the instruction, both of the Christians and unbelievers, thanks God, that he has the gift of tongues more than they, but says, that *in the Church*, or at such Church-meetings, he *had rather*, for the common edification of others, *speak five words*, &c. *than ten t* *housand words*, &c. and so he concludes, (ver. 39) *be zealous to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.* Wi.  
**26** *When you come together*, &c. S. Paul here settles the rules, which they are to observe in their meetings: *one hath a psalm*, the Spirit inspiring him with some psalm, or spiritual canticle, whereby to praise God: another hath the gift of *doctrine*, to instruct all there present: another the gift of *tongues*, which he will not have him to make use of, unless when there is one to *interpret*, that all *things may be done in* the most profitable manner *unto edification. Two* or *thre* *e* at a meeting may *speak with tongues*, if another *interpret.* Wi.  
**29** **Ver.** **29–32** **.** *Two or three*, who have the gift of *prophecy*, may speak by turns in one of these assemblies, and the rest of the prophet shall *judge*, whether he be truly inspired, and speak good doctrine.—*If any thing be revealed to another sitting* by, let the former, who was standing and speaking, *hold his peace*, which they can do; *for t* *he spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets*, that is, they are not like men possessed with evil spirits, who have not power to desist, or to be silent; but these who are moved by an impulse of the holy Spirit, have it in their power either to speak or to be silent, as they judge convenient; for the true God is not the God of dissension and confusion, but the God of *peace* and order. Wi.  
**34** *Let women* be silent, and not speak at all in public Church-meetings: and if they would ask any thing, let them ask it at home.

## Chapter 15

**7** *He was seen by James.* The time is not mentioned in the gospels. Wi.  
**8** *As by one born out of due time;* not born at the ordinary term, meaning after Christ’s ascension. He calls himself so out of humility, abortives being commonly imperfect and less than others. Wi.  
**10** *I have laboured more abundantly.* He does not say better, or that he excelled them; and even as to his labours, he gives the honour to God: *Not I, but the grace of God with me.* Wi.  
**13** **Ver.** **13–23** **.** He brings many reasons to convince them of the resurrection. 1. If *there be no resurrecti* *on* for others, *Christ is not risen again:* but his resurrection (as he tells them v. 4) was foretold *in the Scriptures.* 2. *And if Christ be not risen again, … your faith is also in vain*, this being one of the chief articles of your belief. 3. We shall be found guilty of lies and impostures; and yet we have confirmed this doctrine by many miracles. 4. It would follow that you are not freed from your *sins;* i.e. unless Christ, by his resurrection, has triumphed over sin and death. 5. Without a resurrection we Christians, who live under self-denials and persecutions, would be the most miserable of all men, neither happy in this world nor in the next, for the happiness of the soul requires also a happy resurrection of the body. 6. Christ is *the first-fruits*, and the first begotten of the dead, of those *who have slept:* and by his being the first-fruits, it must be supposed that others also will rise after him. 7. As death came by the first man, (*Adam*) so the second man (Christ) came to repair the death of men, both as to body and soul; and without Christ’s resurrection, both the souls of men have remained dead in their original sins, and their bodies shall not rise again. Wi.  
**24** **. &c.** *Afterwards the end;* i.e. after the general resurrection of all, will be *the end* of the world. Then Christ shall *deliver up his kingdom*, as to this world, over all men, over the devil and his apostate angels, signified by *principalities* and *powers;* not but that Christ, both as God and man, shall reign for all eternity, not only over his elect but over all creatures, having triumphed by his resurrection over the enemy of mankind, the devil, over sin, and over death, which is as it were the *last enemy* of his elect. At the general resurrection, Christ will present these elect to his heavenly Father, as the fruits of his victory over sin and death; and though as man he came to suffer and die, and was also made *subject* to his *eternal Father*, yet being God as well as man, he is Lord of all, and will make his faithful servants partakers of his glory in his heavenly kingdom. Wi.  
**28** *The Son also himself shall be subject to him.* That is, the Son will be subject to the Father, according to his human nature, even after the general resurrection; and also the whole mystical body of Christ will be entirely subject to God, obeying him in every thing. Ch.  
**29** *Who are baptized for the dea* *d.* [1] He still brings other proofs of the resurrection. This is a hard place, and the words are differently expounded. 1. Several late interpreters understand a metaphorical baptism, and that to be *ba* *ptized for the dead*, is to undertake self-denials, mortifications, and works of penance, in hopes of a happy resurrection; and this exposition agrees with what follows, of *being exposed to dangers eve* *ry hour*, of *dying daily*, &c. But if this had been the apostle’s meaning, he would rather have said, Who baptize themselves. Besides, this exposition is not so much as mentioned in any of the ancient interpreters. 2. Some think that S. Paul tells the Corinthians that they ought not to question the resurrection of the dead, who had a custom among them, if any one died without baptism, to baptize another that was living for him; and this they did, fancying that such a baptism would be profitable to the dead person, in order to a happy resurrection. Tertullian mentions this custom in one or two places, and also S. Chrys. on this place. But it does not seem probable that S. Paul would bring any argument of the resurrection from a custom which he himself could not approve, nor was ever approved in the Church. 3. S. Chrys. and the Greek interpreters, who generally follow him, expound these words, *who are baptized for the dead*, as if it were the same as to say, who receive baptism with hopes that they themselves, and all the dead, will rise again; and therefore make a profession, when they are baptized, that they believe the resurrection. So that S. Paul here brings this proof among others, that they who have been made Christians, and continue Christians, cannot call in question the resurrection, which they professed to believe in their creed at their baptism, the creed being always repeated before they were baptized. 4. Others, by being *baptized for the dead*, understand those who begged and called for baptism when they were in danger of death, and would by no means go out of this world without being baptized, hoping thereby to have a happy resurrection of their bodies; so that to be baptized for the dead is the same as on the account of the state of the dead, which they were entering into. See S. Epiphan. hær. viii. p. 114. Edit Petavii. Wi. Some think the apostle here alludes to a ceremony then in use: but others, more probably, to the prayers and penitential labours performed by the primitive Christians for the souls of the faithful departed: or to the baptism of afflictions and sufferings undergone for sinners spiritually dead. Ch.  
**31** *By your glory.* [2] He seems, especially by the Greek text, to call God to witness, and to protest by the reasons he has to glory or boast in their conversion, that his life is as it were a continual death. Other expound it, I die daily *for your* glory; or, that I may have reason to glory for the progress of the gospel. Wi.  
**32** *With beasts at Ephesus.* He seems to mean, with men as cruel and brutal as beasts: for there is not sufficient reason to think that at Ephesus he was exposed to beasts in the amphitheatre. Wi.—Interpreters are divided upon this passage. Calmet is of opinion that S. Paul was exposed in the amphitheatre at Ephesus, but was secured from all injury by the all-powerful hand of God: he produces the testimony of S. Chrys. Theo. S. Amb. S. Cyp. and S. Hil. all of whom understand this passage in the literal sense. Nicephorus cites a book, entitled *The Travels of S. Paul*, in confirmation of this fact, wherein (he informs us) there is a long account of this transaction. S. Jerom says, that S. Paul was condemned by the governor of Ephesus to be devoured by beasts. Estius seems to maintain the same opinion as Chall. To inspirit us to combat, it is advisable to turn our eyes frequently to a future life. The brevity of the present is a principle common to the morality of Jesus Christ, and to that of Epicurus. But how contrary are the conclusions! Why should we not rather say: “Let us watch, and fast, and pray, and do penance, for to-morrow we die; and after that, judgment.”—*Let us eat and drink*, &c. That is, if we did not believe that we were to rise again from the dead, we might live like the impious and wicked, who have no belief in the resurrection. Ch.  
**33** *Evil communications* (or discourses) *corrupt good manners.* He hints that this error against the resurrection, and the other faults into which they had fallen, were occasioned by the heathen philosophers and other vain teachers among them. Wi.  
**35** **Ver.** **35–50** **.** *How do the dead rise again?* He now answers the objections these new teachers made against the resurrection. S. Chrys. reduces them to these two questions: how is it possible for them to rise? and in what manner, or with what qualities, will they rise? To shew the possibility, he brings the example of a grain of wheat, or of any seeds, which must be corrupted, and die as it were in the ground, and then is quite changed, comes up with *a blade*, a stalk, and an ear quite different from what it was when sown, and yet comes to be wheat again, or to be a tree that produces the same kind of fruit: so God can raise *our bodies as he pleaseth.* He also tells them that there are very different bodies, *terrestrial*, and *celestial*, some more, some less glorious, differing in beauty and other qualities, as God pleaseth. As the *sun* is brighter than the *moon*, and as one *sta* *r* is *brighter* than another, so shall it be at the general resurrection. But all the bodies of the elect shall be happily changed to a state *of incorruption.* v. 42. Here the bodies even of the just are subject to corruption, to decay, liable to death, but they shall then rise to a state of incorruptibility and immortality: And so he answers the second question, that here every one’s body is a weak, sensual, *animal* body, clogged with many imperfections, like that of Adam after he had sinned; but at the resurrection, the bodies of the saints shall be spiritual bodies, blessed with all the perfections and qualities of a glorified body, like to that of Christ after he was risen.—S. Paul also, comparing the *first man* (*Adam*) with Christ, whom he calls the second or the *last Adam*, (v. 45) says that the first Adam was made a *living soul*, (i.e. a living animal, or a living creature, with a life and a body that required to be supported with corporal food) but that Christ was made a *quickening Spi* *rit:* he means, that though he had a true mortal body by his nativity of his Virgin Mother, yet that by his resurrection he had a glorified body, immortal, that needed no corporal food, and that he would also give such spiritual and immortal bodies to those whom he should make partakers of his glory.—*But not first that which is spiritual*, &c. (v. 46) that is, both in Adam and in us, and even in Christ, the body was first mortal, which should afterwards be made spiritual and immortal by a happy resurrection.—*The first* Adam (v. 47) *was of the earth, earthly*, made of clay, and with such a body as could die, *but the second man* (Christ) was *from heaven, heavenly:* not that he took a body from heaven, as some ancient heretics pretended, but he was heavenly not only because he was the Son of God, but in this place he seems to be called heavenly even as to his body, after his resurrection, his body being then become spiritual and immortal.—*Such as is the earthly* man, &c. (v. 48) that is, as the first man, Adam, was earthly by his earthly and mortal body, so were we and all his posterity *earthly;* but such *as the heavenly* man, Christ, *was heavenly*, and rose with a heavenly and immortal body; so shall all those be heavenly, to whom he shall give a spiritual, a heavenly, and an immortal body at their happy resurrection.—*Therefore*, (v. 49) *as we have borne the image of the earthly* man, (that is, have been made mortal, and also by sin subject to the corrupt inclinations of this mortal body) *so let us bear also the image of the heavenly* one, by a new life imitating Christ, by which means we shall be glorified with him, both as to soul and body.—*Now this I say*, and admonish you, *brethren*, (v. 50) *that flesh and blood cannot possess the kingdom of God;* i.e. those that lead a sensual and carnal life, nor the corruption of sin, deserve the state of incorruption in glory. Wi.  
**51** *We shall all indeed rise again, but we shall not all be changed.* [3] This is the reading of the Latin Vulgate, and of some Greek MSS. and the sense is, that all both good and bad shall rise, but only the elect to the happy change of a glorified body. The reading in most Greek copies at present is, *we sha* *ll not all sleep*, (i.e. die) *be we shall be all changed:* so also read S. Chrysostom: and S. Jerom found it in many MSS. from which divers, especially of the Greek interpreters, thought that such as should be found living at the day of judgment should not die, but the bodies of the elect (of whom S. Paul here speaks) should be *changed* to a happy state of immortality. This opinion, if it deserve not to be censured, is at least against the common persuasion of the faithful, who look upon it certain that all shall die before they come to judgment. Some expound the Greek only to signify, that all *s* *hall not sleep*, i.e. shall not remain for any time in the grave, as others who die are accustomed to do. Wi.  
**52** *In a moment*, &c. By the power of the Almighty all shall rise again in their bodies, either to a happy or a miserable resurrection. Wi.  
**54** *Death is swallowed up in victory*, in regard of the saints and the elect, so that it may be said, *O death, where is thy victory? O death, w* *here is thy sting?* over which the saints shall triumph, and also over sin and hell. Wi.

## Chapter 16

**1** S. Paul had been charged by the apostles at the council of Jerusalem, to collect alms from the faithful of other Churches, for their poor brethren in Palestine. The apostle acquitted himself of his commission with the greatest possible zeal, and he wishes in this chapter to excite the Corinthians to a like generous conduct with the Galatians: (Cal.) a pastoral ordinance this for alms-deeds, which should be prompt, free, and proportionate to our means. It is just to prefer the wants of the children of the Church to others, particularly in those places whence the light of faith has been received, Jerusalem and Rome.  
**2** *On the* [1] *first day of the week*, which is Sunday, and our sabbath, not the Jewish sabbath, as S. Chrys. observes, so that before this time, the apostles had appointed the first day of the week for the worship of God. Wi.  
**5** *Now I will come.* S. Paul came to Corinth a year after he had written this epistle. Titus, his favourite disciple, arrived at Corinth before S. Paul, and was received with the greatest marks of esteem: by him he sent his second epistle to the Corinthians. Calmet.  
**9** *A gate is opened to me, large and evident;* that is, a fair and good occasion of labouring to convert many, where there are many *adversaries.* Wi.—The work of God is carried on by the power of the cross, and in the midst of contradictions and persecutions. If we suffer this to damp our courage, we forget that we are ministers of a crucified master, and ought to wear his livery.  
**12** *As to our brother.* S. Paul here makes an apology for sending Timothy to them, who was a young man, and not so renowned for eloquence and sanctity as Apollo, informing them that Apollo did not wish to come, perhaps on account of the commotions that were at Corinth on his account. Est.  
**13** A Christian is a soldier, environed and attacked on all sides by enemies. It is his duty to guard against surprise. He should never abandon the post of faith, nor the fortress of the Church, unless he wish to fall an easy prey to his adversaries. He should fight with courage, and after each attack, carefully repair the breaches made by the enemy, that he may be in a condition to sustain fresh attacks by charity, which is the principle, the soul, the life, and heart of our every action.  
**15** *The first-fruits of Achaia;* the first there converted. Wi.  
**17** *Which was wanting on your part, they have supplied*, by informing me, and giving me a full account of all. Wi.  
**22** *Let him be anathema*, accursed. Maran Atha, [2] which, according to S. Jerom and S. Chrys. signify, the Lord *is come* already, and so is to be taken as an admonition to those who doubted of the resurrection, and is to put them in mind, that Christ, the Judge of the living and the dead, is come already. The Rabbinical writers tells us, there are three curses among the Jews called by different names: that the first was *niddui*, which implied an expulsion from the synagogue for a time; the second was greater, such being quite cut off from the common society, called Cherem; the third, *Maran Atha*, the Lord cometh, is coming, or is come, which was followed by exemplary judgments and punishments. Thus Mons. Hure, in his Bible Dictionary, Mr. Legh, in his Critica Sacra, and also Mr. Nary. But whether this is better grounded than many other Rabbinical stories, let others judge. Wi.  
**24** Happy, thrice happy the pastor, whose life, labours, zeal, and the testimony of his own conscience, embolden him to say with S. Paul, that he loves the flock of Jesus Christ, that he only loves them for Jesus Christ, and in Jesus Christ, by virtue of the Holy Spirit.
