# Galatians Commentary

**Corinth** was the capital of Achaia, a very rich and populous city, where S. Paul had preached a year and a half, and converted a great many. See Acts 18:10. Now having received a letter from them, (c. 7:1) and being informed of divers disputes and divisions among them, (c. 1 v. 11) he wrote this letter to them, and sent it by the same persons, Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, who had brought him their letter, c. 16:17. It was written about the year 56, not from Philippi, as it is commonly marked at the end of the Greek copies, but rather from Ephesus. The subject and main design of this Epistle was to take away the divisions among them about the talents and merits of those who had baptized and preached to them, and to settle divers matters of ecclesiastical discipline. The apostle justifieth his mission, and his manner of preaching, c. 1 2 3 4. He teacheth them what was to be done with the man guilty of a scandalous sin of incest, c. 5. He speaks of sins against chastity; of matrimony; and of the state of continency, c. 6. and 7. Of meats offered to idols, c. 8. Of his manner of conversing with them, and what their conversation ought to be, c. 9. and 10. Of the holy sacrament of the Eucharist, c. 11. Of the different gifts of the Holy Ghost, and how to employ them, c. 12 13 and 14. Of the faith of the resurrection, c. 15. Of charitable contributions, and of his design of coming again to them, c. 16. Wi.—S. Paul having planted the faith in Corinth, where he had preached a year and a half, and converted a great many, went to Ephesus. After being there three years, he wrote this first Epistle to the Corinthians, and sent it by the same persons, Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, who had brought their letter to him. It was written about twenty-four years after our Lord’s ascension, and contains several matters appertaining to faith and morals, and also to ecclesiastical discipline. Ch.

The apostle here shews the necessity of the great virtue of charity, that is, of the love of God, and of our neighbour. Wi.

S. Paul gives them further instructions how to make a right use of these gifts, of *prophesying*, of *interpreting*, and especially of *speaking tongues.* He is far from condemning the gift of speaking tongues, in proper circumstances, but only the indiscreet use, or the abuse of it. This is evident by the 5th verse, *I would have you all to speak with tongues, but rather to prophesy.* He blames those assemblies and meetings, (v. 23) when all present speak tongues together, by which means, the infidels that came thither, and ought to be instructed, understood nothing. He permits at their meetings *two* or *three* (v. 27) to *speak tongues*, provided some other *interpret* them. He also orders, that only *two* or *three prophets* speak at a meeting, and by *turns*, to avoid confusion, that those present may be edified, exhorted, and instructed. Wi.

This chapter is addressed to some among the Corinthians who denied the resurrection: S. Paul, therefore, in order to cure this philosophical opinion, gives them his counsel and advice in this chapter; and lest he might be thought to preach up a new doctrine, in the beginning of his admonitions he informs them that he is preaching no other gospel than what he has always taught, and wherein they believe. Estius.

**The** subject and design of this second Epistle to the Corinthians, is much the same as of the former. He comforts and congratulates with those who were now reformed by his admonitions. He blames the faulty with apostolical liberty; and being forced to justify himself and his proceedings against the upstart false teachers, he gives an ample account of his sufferings, and also of the favours and graces, which God had bestowed upon him. This Epistle was written not long after the first, (an. 57.) some months before that to the Romans, from some place in Macedonia, perhaps from Philippi, as marked at the end of divers Greek copies, though it is observed, that those subscriptions are not much to be relied upon. Wi.—In this Epistle S. Paul comforts those who are now reformed by his admonitions to them in the former, and absolves the incestuous man on doing penance, whom he had before excommunicated for his crime. Hence he treats of true penance, and of the dignity of the ministers of the New Testament. He cautions the faithful against false teachers, and the society of infidels. He gives an account of his sufferings, and also of the favours and graces which God hath bestowed on him. Ch.—S. Paul, not being able to come to the Corinthians as soon as he had promised, writes this Epistle to inform them, that it was not through inconstancy, but on account of several weighty reasons, which had hitherto hindered him. Several other reasons, likewise, compelled him to write. For during his absence, several false teachers of the Jews had come amongst them, teaching them that it was necessary to observe the law of Moses, in order to be saved. S. Paul, therefore, first excuses himself, by saying, that the afflictions and troubles he had met with, had hindered him from coming to them. He next orders the fornicator to be restored to favour; after which, he extols his apostleship, forming a comparison between the law of Christ, and of Moses, wherein he blames the false teachers. He then subjoins an exhortation to a pious and holy life, with liberality in their alms, after the example of the Macedonians. As the false teachers had been very industrious in establishing their own reputation, by detracting from that of S. Paul, he enumerates his own sufferings, and the favours he had received from God, shewing that he had much more reason to glory than they; and concludes by exhorting them to correct those faults with which they still remained infected. Estius.—This letter may be justly appreciated as a perfect masterpiece of that animated and solid eloquence, which all interpreters so much admire in S. Paul. V.

In these three following chapters, S. Paul, for the common good of those whom he had converted, and to obviate the prejudice raised by his adversaries against his person and preaching, is forced to set in a true light his apostolical authority, the favours he had received from God, his actions, his labours, and his sufferings, with an apology for mentioning them, giving all the glory to God. Wi.

The Galatians, soon after S. Paul had preached the gospel to them, were seduced by some false teachers, who had been Jews, and who were for obliging all Christians, even those who had been Gentiles, to observe circumcision, and the other ceremonies of the Mosaical law. In this epistle he refutes the pernicious doctrine of those teachers, and also their calumny against his mission and apostleship. The subject matter of this epistle is much the same as of that to the Romans. It was written at Ephesus, about twenty-three years after our Lord’s ascension. Ch.—The Galatians were originally Gauls, who under their leader, Baennus, spread themselves over Greece, and at length passed over into Asia Minor, where they settled between Cappadocia and Phrygia, in the province afterwards called from them Galatia. It seems that S. Peter preached first in those parts; but it was only to the Jews, as may be gathered from the inscription of his first epistle, which he addresses to the Jews of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. But S. Paul was the first that preached to the Gentile inhabitants of this province. When he first preached to them, he was received as an angel from heaven, or rather, as Christ himself: he visited them oftener than once, and the Church he there formed was very considerable. It was the Jewish converts of Galatia (who, as we have before mentioned, were the spiritual children of S. Peter) that caused those troubles which gave rise to this epistle. They strongly advocated the legal observances; and making a handle of the high pre-eminence of S. Peter, they decried S. Paul, even calling in question his apostleship. They taught the necessity of circumcision, and other Mosaic rites, which the apostles then in part retained. Thus divisions were raised in this infant Church. On these accounts the apostle warmly asserts his apostleship, as being called by Christ himself. He shews that his doctrine was that of the other apostles, who, in the council of Jerusalem, four years before, testified their exemption from the legal observances. He teaches, that it is not by the law, but by faith, that the blessings of salvation are imparted to them. After establishing these more important parts of the epistle, he gives them instruction on various heads. The Greek subscription to this epistle informs us, that it was written from Rome. S. Jerom says, he wrote it when in chains. Theodoret says, it was the first epistle that S. Paul wrote from Rome. This opinion has probably been adopted from a mistaken interpretation of the text: *I bear the mark* *s of the wounds of Christ in my body.* By these marks they understand chains, whilst the text equally applies to the mortifications and self-denials of a Christian. The contrary opinion is, that this epistle was written from Ephesus in the year of Christ 55. This is the more probable opinion, and is maintained by S. Greg. the Great, Ludovicus, Capellanus, Estius, Usher, Pearson, and many others. The authority of the Greek copies, in assigning the places whence the letters were written, has been long rejected by the learned. We find not such information in the more ancient Greek manuscripts of S. Germanus and Clermont, &c. Calmet.

## Chapter 1

**1** **. &c.** The apostle begins by asserting his apostleship which the false teachers had called in question. He was called to it by Christ himself, in his miraculous conversion, being changed “into a vessel of election to carry his name before kings and nations, and the children of Israel.” Thus chosen, we see him immediately after his conversion, preaching in Damascus and Arabia. Calmet.—Let us beware of self-appointed teachers, who are neither called by God nor rightly ordained by men, and yet are observed to intrude themselves into the ministry.—*Not from man, neither by man.* [1] The apostle here expressly says, all the brethren who are with me; to shew that he advanced nothing which was not conformable to the belief of all the faithful. S. Jerom.—And again he says, (v. 12) *ne* *ither did I receive it from man, nor did I learn it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.* That is, not from him, who was a man only, but from Jesus Christ, who was both God and man. S. Jerom, who has left us a commentary on this epistle, (tom. iv. p. 222. Ed. Ben. as also S. Chrys. tom. iii. p. 709. Ed. Sav.) takes notice, that Christ’s divinity is proved from these expressions, that S. Paul was not an apostle, nor had his mission from man only, but from Jesus Christ, who therefore was not a man only.—*By Jesus Christ and God the Father.* A second argument to shew the equality of the Son with the Father. And thirdly, it destroys another objection of the Arians, who used to pretend that the Father, being always first named, he only, and not the Son, was properly God. Fourthly, another of their arguments to prove only the Father truly God, was that he was called *the God*, with the Greek article; and here the Father is called God, without the said Greek article. Fifthly, they also pretended that the Son was not God, because the Father was said to deliver him to death: and here (v. 3) the Son is said *to give* and *deliver* himself. Wi.  
**6** **Ver.** **6–7** **.** This was about three or four years after their conversion. The apostle knowing very well how to suit his discourse to his auditors, in this epistle makes use of a more severe and harsh address than is observable in his other epistles. The reason is, the Galatians were a less civilized people, and had already shewn the little attachment they had to their spiritual father. Calmet.—*To another gospel: which is not* [2] *another.* That is, it is not properly another, because they pretended to be Christians, and teach the faith: and yet it was in some measure *another*, because *changed* by such teachers with a mixture of errors, particularly that all converted Gentiles were to observe the Jewish law: and in this sense, they are said *to subvert*, or destroy *the gospel of Christ:* so that the apostle hesitates not to pronounce and repeat *an anathema* *, a curse* upon all that preach any thing *besides*, that is, in point of religion, not agreeing with what he had taught. I cannot omit here a reflection, which S. Chrys. makes on the 7th verse. *Where ar* *e they*, saith he, *who condemn us* (Catholics) *for the differences* we have with heretics? and *who pretend there is no* such essential *difference betwixt us and them*, so as to judge them excluded from the communion of the Catholic Church, out of which there is no salvation, unless perhaps through ignorance.—*Let them hear what S. Paul says, that they destroyed the gospel who made any such innovations:* to wit, by introducing again as necessary some of the Jewish ceremonies, even at a time when the Christians, who had been Jews, might lawfully use them, and even they who had been Gentiles. S. Paul says, this is to *change* and *destroy* the gospel; he repeats *anathema* against them. Let them hear, and take notice of this, who pretend that the unity of the one Catholic faith is sufficiently maintained by all Christian societies, that agreeing, as they say, in fundamentals, their faith is a saving faith: that the council of Trent, without reason, pronounced such anathemas against them: that all Catholics are uncharitable for denying them to be in the way to salvation, when they make Scripture alone, as interpreted by their private judgment, the only rule of their faith. They may as well accuse not only S. Chrys. but also S. Paul, of *uncharitableness*, &c. Wi.  
**9** The terrible sentence awarded by S. Paul, bears equally strong against modern as against ancient innovators in religion.  
**10** **0** **.** *If I did yet please men, I should not be the servant of Christ.* I should not have embraced the Christian faith, I who was so zealous against it, and who by changing have exposed himself to persecutions, &c. Wi.  
**14** He here alludes to his being a Pharisee, as he himself mentions more openly in Acts 23:6. *A Pharisee, and son of Pharisees.* This sect always distinguished itself by its zeal for ancient traditions, which shews evidently that he was very far from being instructed in a religion of which he was the sworn enemy; nor since his conversion did he apply for instruction. What he delivered, he learned not of man, but of God. See below.  
**16** *I condescended not to flesh and blood.* Lit. *I did not acquiesce to flesh and blood.* I had no regard to temporal friends or advantages. Some expound it, I did not think it necessary to consult the other apostles, men who were my countrymen: and so it follows, *I came not to Jerusalem to the apostles*, to be instructed by them, having been instructed by Christ himself. Wi.  
**17** So far from receiving his apostleship from the other apostles, he saw none of them, till he had spent three years in announcing the word of God. Calmet.—In this epistle to the Galatians, S. Paul treats the same matter as in his epistle to the Romans; to the former he writes less exactly and more briefly, as very rude and uncivilized; to the latter, with more precision, and with greater copiousness, as *replenished with all knowledge:* repleti omni scientia. Rom. 15:14.  
**18** *Then three years after, I came to Jerusalem to see* (and as S. Chrys. says, out of respect to make a visit to) *Peter*, but staid only at Jerusalem fifteen days, and saw none of the apostles except him, and James, the brother, or cousin of our Lord; so that I was yet unknown by face to the Christian churches in Judea. Wi.

## Chapter 2

**1** *Then fourteen years after.* That is, after my former going to Jerusalem, which was seventeen years after my conversion, an. 51. See Tillemont. Wi. The cause of S. Paul’s second journey to Jerusalem was as follows. Some brethren coming from Judea to Antioch, there maintained the necessity of circumcision and the other Mosaic rites, asserting that without them salvation could not be obtained. S. Paul, upon his return to Antioch, strongly defended, in conjunction with Barnabas, the liberty of the gospel. As the contest grew warm, it was resolved to depute Paul and Barnabas to consult the other apostles and ancients of Jerusalem. By the approbation of the living and speaking tribunal, which all are commanded to hear, the Scriptures are not made true, altered or amended; they merely are declared to be the infallible word of God, a point only to be learned by authority; hence that memorable saying of S. Austin: “I would not believe the gospel unless the authority of the Church moved me.” Cont. ep. fund. c. v.  
**2** *According to revelation*, or an inspiration from the Spirit of God, and conferred with them, as an equal, says S. Jerom.—*But apart to them, who seemed to b* *e something* considerable. That is, with the other apostles, *lest I should run in vain*, not for fear of false doctrine, says S. Chrys. but that others might be convinced that I preached not any thing disapproved by the apostles, which would prejudice the progress of the gospel. Wi.—The particle *but*, which begins this verse, is quite useless: the Latin Vulgate and the Greek copies have it indeed, but in many copies it is not found; it is omitted also by S. Jerom and Theodoret; and this verse is united in sense with the preceding. Titus was not compelled to be circumcised on account of the false brethren, &c.  
**3** *Neither Titus … circumcised*, who had been a Gentile. A convincing proof, says S. Chrys. that even according to the other apostles, the Gentiles converted, were not subject to the Jewish laws. Wi.  
**5** *To whom we yielded not.* S. Jerom takes notice that in some Latin copies read, *to whom we yielded;* but that was not the true reading by the Greek and Syriac. Wi.  
**7** *As to* *Peter was that of the circumcision.* Calvin pretends to prove by this, that S. Peter and his successors are not head of the whole Church, because S. Peter was only the apostle of the Jews. But S. Paul speaks not here of the power and jurisdiction, but of the manner that S. Peter and he were to be employed. It was judged proper that S. Peter should preach chiefly to the Jews, who had been the elect people of God, and that S. Paul should be sent to the Gentiles; yet both of them preached both to Jews and Gentiles: and S. Peter, by receiving Cornelius, first opened the gate of salvation to the Gentiles, as he says of himself, (Acts 15:7) *that God made choice* of him, that *the Gentiles* by his *mouth should hear the gospel, and believe.* That S. Peter was head of the Church, see the notes on Matt. 16. and John 21. Wi.  
**9** *James, and Cephas, and John.* No proof of any greater authority can be drawn from the placing or numbering of James first, which perhaps S. Paul might do, because of the great respect he knew the Jewish converts had for S. James, bishop of Jerusalem, where the ceremonies of the law of Moses were still observed. Several Greek copies have *Peter, James, and John.* So we also read in S. Jerom’s Commentary, p. 240, and S. Chrys. in his Exposition, p. 729, has *Cephas, John, and James.* Wi.  
**11** *But when Cephas*, &c. [1] In most Greek copies, we read *Petrus*, both here and v. 13. Nor are there any sufficient, nor even probable grounds to judge, that *Cephas* here mentioned was different from *Peter*, the prince of the apostles, as one or two later authors would make us believe. Among those who fancied Cephas different from Peter, not one can be named in the first ages, except Clemens of Alexandria, whose works were rejected as apocryphal by Pope Gelasius. The next author is Dorotheus of Tyre, in his Catalogue of the seventy-two disciples, in the fourth or fifth age, and after him the like, or same catalogue, in the seventh age, in the Chronicle, called of Alexandria, neither of which are of any authority with the learned, so many evident faults and falsehoods being found in both. S. Jerom indeed on this place says, there were some (though he does not think fit to name them) who were of that opinion; but at the same time S. Jerom ridicules and rejects it as groundless. Now as to authors that make Cephas the same with S. Peter, the prince of the apostles, we have what may be called the unexceptionable and unanimous consent of the ancient fathers and doctors of the Catholic Church, as of Tertullian, who calls this management of S. Peter, *a fault of convers* *ation, not of preaching* or doctrine. Of S. Cyprian, of Origen, of the great doctors, S. Jerom, S. Aug. S. Chrys. S. Greg. the Great, of S. Cyril of Alex. of Theodoret, Pope Gelasius, Pelagius the second, S. Anselm, S. Thomas. In later ages, of Bellarm. Baronius, Binius, Spondan, of Salmeron, Estius, Gagneius, Tirinus, Menochius, Alex. Natalis, and a great many more: so that Cornelius a Lapide on this place says, *that the Church neither knows, nor celebrates any other Cephas but S. Peter.* Tertullian and most interpreters take notice, that S. Peter’s fault was only a lesser or venial sin in his conduct and *conversation.* Did not S. Paul on several occasions do the like, as what is here laid to S. Peter’s charge? that is, practise the Jewish ceremonies: did not he circumcise Timothy after this, an. 52? did he not *shave his* head in *Cenchrea*, an. 54? did he not by the advice of S. James (an. 58.) *purify himself* with the *Jews in the temple*, not to offend them? S. Jerom, and also S. Chrys. [2] give another exposition of this passage. They looked upon all this to have been done by a contrivance and a collusion betwixt these two apostles, who had agreed beforehand that S. Peter should let himself *be reprehended* by S. Paul, (for this they take to be signified by the Greek text) and not that S. Peter was *reprehensible;* [3] so that the Jews seeing S. Peter publicly blamed, and not justifying himself, might for the future eat with the Gentiles. But S. Aug. vigorously opposed this exposition of S. Jerom, as less consistent with a Christian and apostolical sincerity, and with the text in this chapter, where it is called a *dissimulation*, and that Cephas or Peter *walked not uprightly to the truth of the gospel.* After a long dispute betwixt these two doctors, S. Jerom seems to have retracted his opinion, and the opinion of S. Aug. is commonly followed, that S. Peter was guilty of a venial fault of imprudence. In the mean time, no Catholic denies but that the head of the Church may be guilty even of great sins. What we have to admire, is the humility of S. Peter on this occasion, as S. Cyprian observes, [4] who took the reprehension so mildly, without alleging *the primacy, which our L* *ord had given him.* Baronius held that S. Peter did not sin at all, which may be true, if we look upon his intention only, which was to give no offence to the Jewish converts; but if we examine the fact, he can scarce be excused from a *venial indiscretion.* Wi.—*I withstood*, &c. The fault that is here noted in the conduct of S. Peter, was only a certain imprudence, in withdrawing himself from the table of the Gentiles, for fear of giving offence to the Jewish converts: but this in such circumstances, when his so doing might be of ill consequence to the Gentiles, who might be induced thereby to think themselves obliged to conform to the Jewish way of living, to the prejudice of their Christian liberty. Neither was S. Paul’s reprehending him any argument against his supremacy; for is such cases an inferior may, and sometimes ought, with respect, to admonish his superior. Ch.  
**16** **. &c.** *Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law.* S. Paul, to the end of the chapter, seems to continue his discourse to S. Peter, but chiefly to the Jewish Galatians, to shew that both the Gentiles, whom the Jews called and looked upon *as sinners*, and also the Jews, when converted, could only hope to be *justified* and saved by the faith of Christ, and not *by the works of the law.*—*But if while we seek to be justified in Christ*, by faith in him, and by his grace, *we ourselves also are found* *sinners*, as the false doctors teach you, and not to be justified but by the ceremonies and works of the law of Moses, this blasphemous consequence must follow, *that Christ is the minister* and author *of sin*, by making us believe that by faith in him, and complying with his doctrine, we may be justified and saved. For thus we must be considered *transgressors*, unless we renew and *build again* what Christ and we have destroyed.—*For by the law I am dead to the law.* That is, says S. Jerom, by the evangelical law of Christ I am dead to the ancient law and its ceremonies. Others expound it, that by the law and its types and figures, and by the predictions contained in the law, I know the Mosaical law hath now ceased, in which sense he might say, *by the law I am dead to the law.*—*If justice.* That is, if justification and salvation be to be had, or could have been had *by the* works of *the law; therefore Christ died in vain*, and it was not necessary that he should become our Redeemer. Wi.  
**19** He here expresses the change which had been wrought in him. The law to which he had been attached, had passed away from him. Now he was so united to Christ and his cross, that he says: Not I, but Christ liveth in me. The strong expressions made use of by S. Paul with regard to the Jewish law in this chapter, may appear strange, and very capable of a wrong interpretation. But we must ever bear in mind that S. Paul speaks exclusively of the *ceremonial* part of the law, and not of the *moral*, contained in the decalogue: of this latter he says in ep. to the Romans, (2:13) the doers of the law shall be justified. But to effect this, was and is necessary the grace which Jesus Christ has merited and obtained for all, grace which God has shed on all, more or less, from the commencement of the world.

## Chapter 3

**1** *Before whose eyes Jesus Christ.… crucified among you.* [1] The common exposition is, that S. Paul had *before described* and set before them Christ crucified. Others, that it had been clearly foretold by the prophets that Christ was crucified for them. Wi.  
**2** *Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law?* As if he said, you esteem it a great favour to have received those spiritual gifts of working miracles, &c. When you were made Christians, had you these favours *by the works of the law*, or was it not *by the hearing of faith*, and by the faith of Christ, that you had such extraordinary graces? and when you *have begun* thus happily by the *spirit* of Christ and his spiritual gifts, are you for *finishing* and thinking to make yourselves more *perfect* by the exterior works of the law, the circumcision of the flesh, and such like ceremonies? Wi.  
**4** **Ver.** **4–5** **.** *If yet in vain:* i.e. I have still good hopes, that what you have already suffered by persecutions and self-denials, since your conversion, will not be in vain; as they would be, if you sought to be justified by the works and ceremonies of the law of Moses, and not by the faith and law of Christ, by which only you can be truly sanctified. Wi.—S. Jerom, S. Aug. and others, suppose that the power of working miracles still remained in the Galatians, notwithstanding what had passed; but S. Chrysostom and several others, explain it of a power they had formerly possessed. Calmet.  
**6** *As it is written: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.* See Rom. 4:3. They only who imitate the faith of Abraham shall *be blessed* with him, and are his spiritual *children*, whether Jews or Gentiles, whom God promised to bless by the seed of Abraham; i.e. by Christ, who descended from Abraham. Wi.—The apostle thus argues with the Galatians; Abraham, who was never under the law, still received the grace of justification in reward of his faith, even before he had received circumcision. Now, if a person can be justified without the law, the law can be no ways necessary to salvation. Calmet.  
**10** **Ver.** **10–14** **.** *Are under a curse.… cursed is every man*, &c. The sense of these is to be found Deut. 27:26 in the Sept. Some expound them thus: curses are pronounced against every one who keeps not all the precepts of the law, but there is not any one; i.e. scarce any one, who keepeth them all; therefore all under the law are under some curse. But as it cannot be said that no one kept all the precepts, especially the moral precepts of the law, mentioned in that place of Deuteronomy; (for Zacharias and *Elizabet* *h were both just in the sight of God*, Luke 1 and doubtless many others lived so as not to incur those curses, but were just and were saved, though not by virtue of the works of the law only, nor without faith in God, and in their Redeemer, who was to come) therefore others understand that all such persons fall under these curses, who think to comply with all these precepts by their own strength, or who confide in the works of the law only, without faith in Christ, the Messias, and without which they cannot be saved. This agrees with what follows, that *the just man liveth by faith.* Habac. 2:4. See Rom. 1:17.—*Now* the law is not of faith, i.e. the works done merely in compliance with the law, are not works of faith that can save a man: *but he that doth those things* of the law, *shall live in t* *hem;* i.e. says S. Jerom, shall have a long temporal life promised in the law; or, as others say, shall have life everlasting, if they are done with faith.—*Christ hath redeemed us* from these curses; but to do this, hath made *himself a curse* for *our* sake, by taking upon himself the similitude of a sinner, and by dying upon the cross, as if he had been guilty of the greatest sins, having only charged himself with our sins, inasmuch as it *is written:* (Deut. 21:23) *cursed is every one who hangeth on a tree;* which is to be understood, in case he deserve it for his own sins.—*That the blessing of Abra* *ham* (or promised to Abraham) *might be fulfilled;* i.e. Christ redeemed us, that these blessings might be fulfilled on all nations, and that all might receive the *promise of the Spirit*, or the promised spirit of grace believing in Christ, who is now come. Wi.  
**15** **, &c.** *I speak after the manner of man;* or, by a comparison, says S. Chrys. common among men. If a man make or execute his last will, or any deed or contract, it stands good; no one *contemns* it, or pretends to annul it, or add *any* thing to it: how much more shall the testament, the covenant, or solemn promise which God made to Abraham, to bless all nations, stand firm and have its effect? And he said to *his seed*, to *one*, i.e. in *Christ only*, not to *his seeds, as it were by many.* It is observed, that the word *seed* being a collective signification, may grammatically be taken for the plural as well as for the singular number; so that we are to have more regard to S. Paul’s authority, who expounds to us what is here signified by the word seed, than to the word itself.—*The law which was made after four hundred and thirty years* (consult the chronologists) does not make void the testament: nor the *promise* which God himself made to Abraham, that mankind should be blessed only by Christ. These blessings could not be by the law of Moses *ordained*, or delivered *by angels* in the *hand of a mediator*, to wit, of Moses, according to the common interpretation, who, in receiving and publishing the law, was as it were a mediator betwixt God and his people.—And *a mediator is not of one*, (but is called so, as mediating betwixt two parties) *but God is one.* This is to signify, that when he made the covenant or promise to Abraham, he made this promise himself, and did not make use of a mediator inferior to himself, as when he gave the law; and the law, in this respect, was inferior to the promise; but the chief difference was, that true justice and sanctification was not given by the law, for so it would have contradicted and have made void the promise made before to Moses, that the blessings of true sanctification should only be by his seed and by faith in Christ, the Son of Abraham and of David. According to the Scriptures all things (i.e. all men) were shut up together *under sin*, under the slavery of sin, from which they were not to be redeemed but by the accomplishment of the promise, and by the coming of Christ, by his grace, and faith in him. Wi.—*Because of transgressions.* To restrain them from sin, by fear and threats.—*Ordained by Angels.* The law was delivered by Angels, speaking in the name and person of God to Moses, who was the *mediator* on this occasion between God and the people. Ch.—The law was established not to occasion sin, but to *manifest* sin, and to *punish* sin. Ezechiel (20:11) shews the meaning of the apostle, when he says: that God, after bringing the Israelites out of Egypt, imposed laws upon them that gave life to such as observed them. This was the decalogue, published immediately after the passage of the Red Sea; but violating these commandments, they became guilty of idolatry. To *punish* them, God imposed upon them precepts *which are not good, and which give not life.* v. 24, 25. This is the ceremonial law, which was established and published by degrees during the forty years the Israelites sojourned in the desert. It is then evident that this law was given to punish transgressions in the Israelites, and to prevent relapses. This is the sense of S. Paul.  
**22** *Hath concluded all under sin;* i.e. hath declared all to be under sin, from which they could not be delivered but by faith in Jesus Christ, the promised seed. Ch.—The law was not given to all; but all its precepts and prohibitions were binding under sin, and all violators of the law were guilty of sin.  
**24** As for the *law*, it *was put* or given *because of transgressions*, to put a stop, by the punishments prescribed, to idolatry and other crimes, which the Jews had learnt from other nations, particularly in Egypt. The law was a *pedagogue*, or schoolmaster, to direct and correct and bring men to Christ, our chief Master, our great Mediator, who being now come, we are no longer under our former pedagogue. Christ hath by his grace made all, who believe in him and follow his doctrine, his *sons* and his adoptive children, whether they were before *Jews* or *Gentiles;* now they are all *one*, united in the same *faith*, and in the same spirit of charity. All the faithful are to be accounted of *the seed* of Abraham, and his spiritual children by the accomplishment of the promise. Wi.—*Pedagogue;* i.e. schoolmaster, conductor, or instructor. Ch.  
**27** The baptism of infants shews that the sacrament gives grace of itself, by divine appointment; or, as divines say, *ex opere operato* *.*  
**28** *Neither Jew*, &c. That is, no distinction of Jew, &c. Ch.

## Chapter 4

**1** By the child, in this place, the apostle understands all the Jewish people, who, as long as they were under the childhood of the law, were subject to numerous restrictions, although they were the favorite children of God. But when the fulness of time came, they received the adoption of children, and were in possession of the liberty of the law of grace. They were no longer obliged to observe the legal rites. Whence the apostle wishes the conclusion to be drawn, that if persons once subject to the law were now exempt from it, how much more will those be excused from its yoke, who were never under its control. Calmet.  
**3** *Under the elements of the world.* S. Chrys. understands the exterior ceremonies and precepts of the law of Moses, with an allusion to the first elements or rudiments which children are taught. Wi.  
**4** *The fulness of the time.* That is, the time decreed by Divine Providence.—*God sent his Son made of a woman*, who took a true human body of his virgin Mother.—*Under the law*, as he was man, because he was pleased to make himself so. Wi.  
**6** *Crying, Abba.* That is, *Father;* Christ taught us in prayer to call God *our Father*, he having made us his adoptive *sons* by his grace, and *heirs* of heaven. Wi.  
**8** **Ver.** **8–9** **.** *You served them, who by nature are no gods.* These words are to be understood of the converts, who had been Gentiles.—*Known of God.* That is, approved and loved by him. Wi.—The language of the apostle in this verse is not perhaps strictly precise. The Galatians, whom he addresses, had been converted from paganism, and of course were never subject to the law of Moses. But the apostle, by these words, entreats them not to begin now to serve these weak and useless elements, (as he calls the Jewish rites) or by this expression he may mean (as S. Chrys. and Theophyl. explain it) the tyranny of error and wickedness. Calmet.  
**10** **Ver.** **10–11** **.** *You observe* [1] *days*, &c. These false teachers were for obliging all Christians to observe all the Jewish feasts, fasts, ceremonies, &c. Some of the later reformers find here an occasion to blame the fasts and holydays kept by Catholics. S. Jerom, in his commentary on these words, tells us that some had made the like objection in his time: his answer might reasonably stop their rashness; to wit, that Christians keep indeed the sabbath on the Sunday, (not the Jewish sabbath on Saturdays) that they keep also divers holydays, and days on which great saints suffered martyrdom, (let our adversaries take notice of this) but that both the days are different, and the motives of keeping them. See S. Jer. tom. iv. p. 271. Wi.—This text cannot mean to condemn the feasts appointed to be kept holy in the Catholic Church. For on the festivals dedicated to our Lord, S. Austin writeth thus: “We dedicate and consecrate the memory of God’s benefits with solemnities on solemn appointed days, lest in process of time they might creep into ungrateful and unkind oblivion.” And of the martyrs thus: “Christian people celebrate the memories of martyrs with religious solemnity, both to move themselves to an imitation of their virtues, and that they may be partakers of their merits, and helped by their prayers.” Cont. Faust. l. xx. c. 21. And of other saints thus: “keep ye and celebrate with sobriety the nativity of saints, that we may imitate them that are gone before us, and that they may rejoice in us, who pray for us.” In Ps. 88. Conc. 2. in fine.  
**12** *Be ye as I, for I also am as you.* I add no word in the translation, because it is uncertain what is to be understood: some give this construction, be you as *I am*, because I also *was*, as you now *are;* and they expound them thus: lay aside your zeal for the Jewish ceremonies as I have done, who *was* once as zealous for them as you seem now to be. Others would have the construction and sense to be: be you as I *am*, because I *am* as you; that is, be affected to me, and love me, as I have still a true affection and love for you, which is agreeable to what follows, *you have not offended me at all.* Wi.  
**13** **Ver.** **13–16** **.** *Through infirmity of the flesh … and your temptation in my flesh.* S. Jerom thinks the apostle had some bodily infirmity upon him. S. Chrys. understands his poverty, and want, and persecutions, and that some were inclined to contemn him and his preaching on these accounts. Yet others among them did not esteem him less: they received him, respected him as an *Angel of God*, as *Christ Jesus;* they would have given him *their eyes*, as one may say, and all that was dear to them. He puts them in mind how *happy* then they thought themselves, and asketh why they are now so much *changed?* Wi.  
**17** **Ver.** **17–20** **.** He tells them this change comes from the false teachers among them, who with a false *zeal* would *exclude them* from a friendship and a submission to S. Paul, and deprive them again of that Christian liberty by which Christ, and the faith of Christ, had freed them from the yoke of the Mosaical law. On this account I must labor and *trav* *ail*, as it were to *bring you* forth a second time. How do *I now wish* to be *with you*, to *change my voice*, to exhort you, to reprehend you, to use all ways and means to regain you to Christ?—*I am in conf* *usion about you*, [2] I am perplexed, as the Greek signifies, as not knowing what to say or do. Wi.  
**22** *It is written* in the law, that is, in Genesis, (c. 16 and c. 21) that *Abraham had two sons*, &c. that his two sons, *Ismael*, born of his servant, *Agar*, and *Isaac* of his wife, *Sara*, in an *allegorical sense*, represent the two *testaments* or covenants, which God made with his people: that by *Ismael* was represented that covenant of the former law delivered to Moses on Mount Sina, by which the Jews were made his elect people, yet as it were his *servants*, to be kept to their duty by fear of punishments; but by *Isaac* is represented the new covenant or testament of *Christ*, given at Jerusalem, where he suffered, where the new law was first published; by which law, they who believe in Christ were made the spiritual children of Abraham, the *sons* of God, and heirs of the blessings promised to Abraham: that Sina, the *mountain in Arabia*, hath [3] *an affinity with Jerusalem*, and *with her children*, who remain under the *servitude* of the law of Moses: we cannot understand a *conjunction*, or an *affinity*, as to place and situation, Sina and Jerusalem being near twenty days’ journey distant from each other; therefore it can only be an affinity in a mystical signification, inasmuch as Jerusalem was the capital of the Jews, where the children of those who received the law on Mount Sina lived still under the servitude of the same law: but Christians, who believe in Christ, must look upon themselves as belonging to Jerusalem, and not to the city of Jerusalem upon earth, but to the celestial Jerusalem in heaven, which is our *mother*, now no longer servants and slaves to the former law, but *free*, being made the *sons* of God by the grace of Christ, and heirs of heaven. And these blessings were promised to all nations, not only to the Jews, of which the much greater part remained obstinate, and refused to believe in Christ, but also particularly to the Gentiles, according to the prophecy of Isaias, (c. 54) *rejoice thou* that hast been *barren*, like *Sara*, for a long time; i.e. rejoice, you Gentiles, hitherto left in idolatry, without the knowledge or worship of the true God, now you shall have more children among you than among the Jews, who were his chosen people. Wi.  
**29** S. Paul makes another observation upon this example of Ismael and Isaac: that as Ismael was troublesome to Isaac, for which he and his mother were turned out of the family, *so also now* the Jews insulted and persecuted the Christians, who had been Gentiles; but God will protect them as heirs of the blessings promised: they shall be accounted the spiritual children of Abraham, while the Jews, with their carnal ceremonies, shall be cast off. Wi.—This, says S. Austin, is a figure of heretics, (who are the children of the bond-woman) unjustly persecuting the Catholic Church. Ep. 48.

## Chapter 5

**1** *Be not held again under the yoke of bondage*, of the old law. Wi.—This verse must be understood in the same manner as the 9th verse of the preceding chapter. See the annotations upon it.  
**2** *If you* converted from heathenism *be circumcised*, it must be by believing and professing it necessary, which is false doctrine, and then *Christ will profit you nothing:* not that the practice of those ceremonies was at the time sinful, especially for those that had been Jews, but it was an error to judge them necessary for converted Gentiles. Besides, he that judges circumcision necessary, must also judge himself bound to keep all the other ceremonies and precepts of the law. Wi.  
**3** The false teachers had insisted on the observance of circumcision and a few other rites only, as necessary for salvation; but S. Paul assures them, that the receiving of circumcision is an open profession of Judaism, and that he that makes this profession, binds himself to the observance of every part of the law, since a curse is pronounced against those that do not keep it in all its parts. If then circumcision be necessary for salvation, the whole law is necessary also. Calmet.  
**4** If you think that justice cannot be obtained but under the law, you make a renunciation of the justice of Christ: his mediation becomes of no avail to you. Calmet.  
**5** **Ver.** **5–6** **.** *We in spirit* hope for true *j* *ustice* by *faith* in Christ; yet not by faith only, but by faith *working by charity.* Wi.—Here note with S. Austin, that faith is not to be idle, but working or doing good works in charity: wherefore not faith alone. De opere et fide. c. xiv.  
**8** **, &c.** *This persuasion* of yours *is not from him who calleth you;* is not from God: and *I hope* you will be shortly again of no *other mind* than what I taught you. Wi.—This was a Jewish proverb, and alluded to the time of the Pasch, when it was not permitted to eat of any but unleavened bread; during which time the least leaven made the whole mass unclean to a Jew.… Some Greek copies read, μικρα ζυμη ολον το φυραμα ζυμοι, when the sense will be, “a little leaven causes the whole mass to rise.” Calmet.—Hence the introduction of any, however small, share of the ceremonial and Jewish rites, will greatly disfigure the purity and simplicity of the Christian institute.—As *for me*, my adversaries misrepresent me, when they say I preach circumcision; which if I did, I should not be persecuted as I am by the Jews. I never preach it necessary for Gentiles converted, though I have not condemned the use of it in the Jewish converts, provided they do not oblige other converts to it.—*The scandal of the cross is therefore made void.* The sense is, according to S. Jerom, that the Jews’ greatest objection against S. Paul used to be, because he preached that circumcision and the law of Moses need not be observed: another objection against him was, that he preached Jesus, who was crucified on an infamous cross, to be their great Messias. He reasons then in this manner, that if the Jews think he again preacheth the necessity of circumcision and the precepts of the old law, they will no longer be offended that he preacheth Christ crucified, because they were not so much offended with the latter as with the first. Thus also S. Chrys. on this verse. Others expound it thus: If I preach circumcision and the ceremonies of the law, therefore according to my doctrine, the cross of Christ, and justification by the merits of Christ crucified, is abolished, because justification is still to be sought for by the works of the law.—*I would they were even cut of* *f:* separated from your communion by excommunication. This seems the true sense; so that I need not mention any other exposition. See Corn. a Lapide. Wi.  
**13** *An occasion to the flesh;* i.e. that you abuse not, by a vicious life, that Christian liberty which Christ hath purchased for you, but be united in the *spirit of charity.* Wi.  
**14** All the law, as far as it regards our duty to our neighbour, is contained in this text of the apostle; he says the same in his epistle to the Romans, C. 13. He that loves his neighbour has fulfilled the law.  
**17** *So that you* [1] *do not the things that* *you would.* He does not say, so that *you cannot do*, as others falsely translate; as if men were under an absolute necessity of sinning, or doing ill; which is also contradictory to the foregoing words, *walk by the spirit, and you will not accomplish the works of the flesh.* Wi.—Here some suppose, says S. Austin, that the apostle denieth that we have free liberty of will: not understanding that this is said to them, if they will not hold fast the grace of faith conceived, by which only they can walk in the spirit, and not accomplish the lusts of the flesh. S. Austin, in c. v. Gal.  
**22** *The fruit of the Spirit is charity*, &c. There are numbered twelve of these fruits in the Latin, though but nine in the Greek text, in S. Chrys. S. Jerom, S. Aug. tract. lxxxvii. in Joan. p. 756. The difference may again happen by the Latin interpreter using two words to express one Greek word. It is observed, that *longanimity* and *pat* *ience* are in a manner the same; so are *benignity* and *goodness;* and so may be here *continency* and *chastity.* Wi.

## Chapter 6

**2** *One another’s burdens.* This is not contrary to what is added v. 5, that *every one shall bear his own burden*, because in the first place the sense is, that we must bear patiently with one another’s faults and imperfections; in the second, that every one must answer for himself at God’s tribunal. Wi.—Every one has his failings and weaknesses, and stands in need of indulgence from his brethren; he must, therefore, grant to them what he so much desires to receive from them. Calmet.  
**6** *Communicate … in all good things:* by this *communication*, is understood an assisting of others in their wants. Wi.—Such as are blessed with the goods of this world, should gladly communicate a share of their efforts to the preachers and teachers of the true faith; and this not merely as a return for what they have received, but also that they may be made thereby partakers of their merit. S. Aug. l. 2. evang. quæst. q. 8.  
**7** This is addressed to the avaricious, who, under various pretexts, excused themselves from contributing to the support of their teachers. But they are here informed, that their excuses will not screen them from the anger of God. Calmet.  
**8** *He that sowet* *h in his flesh*, &c. The apostle represents the flesh and the spirit like two fields, on which men sow good or bad seed, according to which they shall reap. Wi.  
**9** Works of mercy are the seed of life everlasting, and the proper cause thereof, and not faith only.  
**10** *The household of the faith:* those who profess the same true faith. Wi.—We are more bound to assist Christians than Jews; Catholics than heretics. S. Jerom, q. 1. ad Hedibim.  
**11** *What a letter I have written … with my own hand.* S. Jerom understands this of what he is now beginning to write, the rest being written by the hand of another. Others understand the whole letter. Wi.—S. Chrys. Theophylact, and Theodoret, suppose that the apostle wrote the whole epistle with his own hand, and here excuses himself for writing so ill the Grecian letters, which were so very different from those of his native language. But S. Jerom understands, that he wrote only this latter part of the epistle, as a testimony that the whole came from him. Calmet.  
**12** **Ver.** **12–13** **.** He tells them the false teachers would have them circumcised first, to avoid *persecution* from the Jewish party; and secondly to glory in having made them their proselytes. Wi.  
**14** As for my part, I will *glory* in nothing *but in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ*, but in Christ crucified. Wi.  
**15** *But a new creature;* but to be born anew, to receive the spiritual life of grace. Wi.  
**17** *I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus in my body*, by the stripes and wounds I have received for preaching the gospel. Wi.—Formerly it was not unusual to stamp certain characters on the bodies of soldiers, fugitives, and of domestics, purposely to distinguish them. —— There are three principal parts in this epistle. The first is the history of the vocation of S. Paul, c. 1 and 2; the second is on justification and the abrogation of the law; the third is an exhortation to persevere in Christian liberty, to avoid its abuse, and to perform the various duties of a Christian.
