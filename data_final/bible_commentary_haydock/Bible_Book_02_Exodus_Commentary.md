# Exodus Commentary

The second Book of Moses is called**Exodus**from the Greek wordΕξοδος, which signifies*going out;*because it contains the history of the*going out*of the children of Israel out of Egypt. The Hebrews, from the words with which it begins, call it**Veelle Shemoth**: These are the names. Ch.—It contains the space of 143 years, till the beginning of the second year after the liberation of the Israelites. T.—Their slavery is described in the first chapters; and is supposed to have continued ninety years. D.—The laws prescribed by God to his people, the sacrifices, tabernacle, &c. were all intended to prefigure the Christian dispensation. S. Aug. de C. D. vii. 31.—Moses himself was a type of Jesus Christ, who was rejected by the synagogue, and received by the Gentiles, as the Jewish Legislator was abandoned by his mother, and educated by the Egyptian princess. She delivers him back to his mother; and thus the Jews will, at last, acknowledge our Saviour. D.—God deigns to address his people in the character of a powerful Eastern monarch, and requires the like attention. He appoints his ministers, like guards, to attend before his tabernacle, &c. The laws which he enacts, are such as suited the Jewish people: they were not to rise all at once to perfection; but these laws guide them, as it were, on the road. They are infinitely more perfect than those of the surrounding nations. C.

## Chapter 1

**3** *And Benjamin.*He is mentioned here because he was the son of Rachel, as the preceding were the children of Lia. The offspring of the handmaids follow. H.  
**5** *Seventy:*Sept. “75,” including the offspring of Joseph. See Gen. 46:26.  
**6** *Generation*, or race of mortals who had seen his wonderful works. The tyrant, who knew not Joseph, began his reign about 58 years after that patriarch’s death. C.—His name was Pharao Amenophis, (Perer.) or Ramesses Miamum. Usher.  
**9** *Numerous.*Calvisius observes, that from Ephraim alone might have sprung 4,112,323,729 people. See S. Aug. q. 43, &c. H.—In the space of 215 years, 70 people may produce an immense multitude, as Bonfrere shews by an accurate calculation. God also was pleased to bless the Hebrews with fecundity, so that they*sprung up*(*ebullierunt*) like frogs or fishes, v. 7. In Egypt, the women had sometimes seven at a birth (Plin. vii. 3,) and Aristotle (Anim. vii. 4,) mentions one woman who had 20 children at four births. T.—*Stronger.*This might easily be true, if this king had only Thebais under his command. But if he was king of all Egypt, it seems an exaggeration. C.—Indeed, human policy often gives birth to all kinds of wickedness. The king justifies his cruelty on this pretext of self-defence. He wishes to keep the Hebrews under; yet he is not willing to let them depart, as he knew they intended, according to Joseph’s prediction. H.—God permitted this disposition, in order to punish his people for their idolatry, (Ezec. 23:8,) to admonish them not to fix their abode in Egypt, and to manifest his power and glory in the destruction of the impious. M.  
**11** *Masters*. Cruel like himself, who not only made them build without proper materials, (v. 14 and C. 5:10. H.) but oppressed them with heavy burdens of brick and tile. Hence Aristophanes calls the Hebrews in derisionPlinthophoroi.This servitude is styled*the iron furnace of Egypt*, Deut. 4:20. Jer. 11:4.—*Of tabernacles*, or of storehouses. Ch.—To keep his treasures, Chal. or “fortresses,” Sept. It may also be the name of a city, Miscenoth. C. 12:37.*Phithom*, perhaps the same as the town of*Heroum*, where the Sept. say Joseph first met his father. Gen. 46:28.*Ramesses*was the capital, and situate in the Arabic nome. C.  
**14** *Service.*They were forced to till the land, reap, &c. M.  
**15** *Midwives.*Egyptian women, who assisted all of that district. Josephus xi. 5. There were others under them. Some think all these midwives were of Hebrew extraction, as their names are Hebrew, &c. C.  
**16** *The time*, &c. Heb. “and you shall see them upon the two stones.”*Abenaim.*Jeremias (18:3,) uses the same expression, speaking of a potter hard at work. C.—*A woman*, from whom nothing could be feared, to be reserved for service and for pleasure. M.—We must not obey princes in their unjust commands. Acts 4 and 5. Matt. 10:28. W.  
**19** *Skilful*, &c. Heb. Caioth means*midwives:*or they are full of*vigour*, or bring forth*alive*, like*br**utes.*By this allusion they not only excuse themselves, but seem also to enter into the king’s sentiments of hatred and scorn for the Hebrews. M.—Women in Egypt, and in the eastern regions, are easily delivered, and hardly stand in need of any assistance. Ludolf. 1 K. 4:19. Perhaps, therefore, the midwives spoke truth, with regard to the generality of the Hebrew women. But they gave way to a lie of excuse, with regard to some, (v. 17,) which S. Augustine would not allow, even to save all the Hebrew children. c. Mend. 15. It was not so easy to discover this delusion, as women in that country seldom appear in public; and hence Jochabed was enabled to hide Moses so long. C.  
**21** *Because the midwives feared God*, &c. The midwives were rewarded, not for their lie, which was a venial sin; but for their fear of God, and their humanity: but this reward was only temporal, in*building them houses*, that is, in establishing and enriching their families. Ch.—This alone the Scripture specifies, thought hey might also be filled with heavenly graces. W.—Some conclude from this verse, that the midwives embraced the true religion. The Hebrew refers*built them*to the Hebrews, as if they multiplied in consequence of the humanity of these women; ( C.) and the Vulgate may be explained in the same sense. H.—De Muis supposes, that Pharao ordered houses to be built for the midwives, where the Hebrew women were forced to appear when they were to be delivered, in the presence of commissaries.  
**22** *The river*Nile, where the persecuting successor of this king found his end. H.—It seems this inhuman decree was not published till after Aaron was born, and it was probably revoked soon after the birth of Moses; for if it had been rigorously put in execution, there would have been nothing but old men 80 years after, when Moses led the people out of Egypt. C.—But perhaps even the Egyptians abhorred and refused to execute this edict. M.

## Chapter 2

**1** *After this.*In process of time, without reference to what immediately precedes. The Heb. and Sept. omit these words. H.—The marriage of Amram, grandson of Levi, with his aunt or cousin, had taken place before the persecution. Tostat and others suppose, that people were not then forbidden to marry their aunts. But it is probable Jochabed was only the grand-daughter of Levi, and the daughter of one of Amram’s brothers, as the Sept. insinuate. Otherwise their ages would have been very disproportionate. See C. 6:20. C.  
**2** *Goodly.*Handsome,*elegant.*Heb. 11:23;*agreeable to Go**d.*Acts 7:20. Josephus says, Amram had been assured by God that the child should be the deliverer of his people. Yet he neglects not to use every prudent precaution. W.—*Months.*Heb.*moons;*whence some erroneously infer, that the Hebrew year was not solar. C.  
**3** *Bulrushes*, or paper plant, growing on the banks of the Nile. Such little vessels were used in Egypt in Lucan’s time.*Conseritur bibul**a Memphitis cymba papyro**.*M.—*Sedges*, to prevent it from being carried away by the stream. Cajetan thinks the Hebrews did not drown their children; but by thus exposing them, abandoned them to the king’s use. Acts 7:19.  
**4** *His sister*, Mary, who was born at the beginning of this persecution, and was therefore called*bitterness.*H.—She was about 12 years old. M.  
**5** *Daughter*, and sole heiress. H.—She is called Thermut by Josephus, and Meris by Artapanus. She was going to bathe, or to purify herself, according to the custom of the country; or perhaps she was going to wash linen, as Nausicrae, the daughter of Alcinous, was doing, when she met Ulysses. C.  
**6** *Hebrews*, against whom the persecution raged. She saw it had received circumcision. Theod. q. in Ex.  
**10** *Moses*, or*Moyses*, in the Egyptian tongue, signifies one*taken or saved out of the water.*Ch.—*Mo*, signifies water in the Egyptian tongue;*Mosse*, “he drew out,” in Hebrew. Philo believes that the princess feigned him to be her own child. Moses denied that he was, and would not take advantage of this adoption, Heb. 11:24. He was grown up, and had been well instructed by his parents, ver. 9. He afterwards became well versed in all the sciences, (Acts 7:22,) rejecting what was idle and superstitious. Josephus assures us he became a great conqueror. C.  
**12** *He slew the Egyptian.*This he did by a particular inspiration of God; as a prelude to his delivering the people from their oppression and bondage.*He thought*, says S. Stephen, (Acts 7:25,)*that his brethren understood that God by his hand would save them**.*But such particular and extraordinary examples are not to be imitated. Ch.—He was inspired, on this occasion, to stand up in defence of the innocent. M. S. Tho. ii. 2, q. 60.—The laws of Egypt required every person to protect the oppressed; or, if unable to do it, he was to call in the aid of the magistrate. Diod. i. C.—Moses*looked*round to see if there was any help near. He was 40 years old when he was forced to flee.  
**14** *Feared.*S. Paul, (Heb. 11:27,) is speaking of his leaving Egypt, at the head of the people, when he says,*not fearing the fierceness of the king.*Without being dismayed on this occasion, by the unexpected discovery of what he had done, (which was perhaps undesignedly made public by the Hebrew whom he had rescued,) he resolves not to tempt God. H.  
**15** Madian. A city and country of Arabia, which took its name from Madian the son of Abraham, by Cetura, and was peopled by his posterity. Ch.—There were, perhaps, some of the descendants of Cham, by his son Chus, intermixed with them; ( H.) and hence Aaron reproaches the wife of Moses for being a Chusite. Num. 12:1. Jethro was a Cinean, descended from the same stock.  
**16** *Priest.*Hebrew*cohen*, (or*cen*,) means also a prince, as the Chal. has it. When put in this manner, with the name of a place, it is generally taken in this sense. But formerly kings were also priests. Jethro served the true God, like Job, in the midst of a perverse generation, and offered sacrifice to him, when he joined the camp of the Israelites. Ex. 18:11. C.  
**18** *Raguel.*He had two names, being also called*Jethro*, as appears from the first verse of the following chapter. Ch.—He is also called Hobab and Ceni. Num. 10:2. Jud. 1:16. Perhaps Raguel was father of Jethro. Drusius.  
**21** *Swore.*Heb.Goelis rendered “was willing.”—Sym. has, “He conjured Moses;” and Theod. “Moses began to dwell.” The Sept. neglect the word entirely, “But Moses took up his abode.”  
**22** *Gersam*, or*Gershom.*This name signifies,*a stra**nger there:*as*Eliezer*signifies*the help of God.*Ch.—*And she*, &c. is wanting both in Heb. and Chal. but found in the Complut. edit. of the Sept. It occurs (C. 18:4,) and we might naturally expect to find it in this place. C.  
**23** *Died*in the year 2494. His successor, Amenophis, treading in his footsteps, was drowned 19 years afterwards. Usher.  
**25** *Knew them;*that is, he had respect to them, he cast a merciful eye upon them. Ch.—Heb. “he had regard*for them;*” and, as some Latin copies read,*delivered them.*C.
