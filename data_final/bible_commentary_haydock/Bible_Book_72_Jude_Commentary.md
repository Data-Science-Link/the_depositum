# Jude Commentary

**This** first Epistle of S. Peter, though brief, contains much doctrine concerning faith, hope, and charity, with divers instructions to all persons of every state and condition. The apostle commands submission to rulers and superiors, and exhorts all to the practice of a virtuous life, in imitation of Christ. This epistle was written with such apostolical dignity, as to manifest the supreme authority with which its writer, the prince of the apostles, had been invested by his Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. He wrote it at Rome, which figuratively he calls Babylon, about fifteen years after our Lord’s ascension. Ch.—S. Peter, otherwise called Simon, son of John or Jonas, was from Bethsaida, a city of Galilee. He was married, and lived at Capharnaum, and was employed with his brother Andrew, as fishermen, when our Lord called them. S. Peter on every occasion testified a more than usual zeal for his Master, and hence our Lord shewed him a very particular and very marked attention. He would have Peter present at his transfiguration; (Luke 9:28) and at another time declared that he was a rock, upon which he would build his Church, against which the gates of hell should never prevail. Mat. 16:18. Although S. Peter had the misfortune or weakness to deny Jesus Christ in his passion, our Lord, after his resurrection, gave him fresh proofs of his regard. Mat. 16:7. He continued him in his primacy over all, and appointed him in the most explicit manner visible head of his Church, when thrice asking Peter: “lovest thou me more than these?” and S. Peter as often answering, Christ said to him: “feed my lambs, feed my sheep.” John 21:15.—This epistle was always received in the Church as *canonical*, and as written by S. Peter, prince of the apostles. It is commonly agreed that it was written from Rome, which S. Peter calls Babylon, (C. 5:13) and directed to those in the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, &c. (v. 1) who were before Jews or Gentiles, and had been converted to the Christian faith. It is certain this letter was not written till after the true believers had the name of Christians. C. 4:16. Many think it was written before the year 49; but this is not certain. Others judge not till after the year 60, and some not till a short time before he wrote his second epistle. See Tillem. t. i. Art. 31. on S. Pet. and tom. ii. on S. Mark, p. 89. The main design is to confirm the new converts in the faith of Christ, with divers instructions to a virtuous life. Wi.—Grotius, Erasmus, and Estius, discover in this epistle, a strength and majesty worthy the prince of the apostles. Est autem epistola profecto digna Apostolorum Principe, plena authoritatis et majestatis Apostolicæ: verbis parca, sententiis referta.

**This** Epistle, though not at first received as canonical, was acknowledged as such about the end of the fourth age. See Euseb. l. iii. Hist. c. 3. S. Jer. de Vir. Illust. Tillem. art. 33. The design, as it appears, C. 1:13. and C. 3:1. was to give them admonitions and instructions against teachers of false doctrine, particularly against the *Simonites.* It seems to have been written a little before his martyrdom, about the year 66. Wi.—In this epistle S. Peter says, (C. 3) “Behold this is the second epistle I write unto you:” and before, (C. 1:14) “Being assured that the putting off of this my tabernacle is at hand.” This shews that it was written a very short time before his martyrdom, which was about thirty-five years after our Lord’s ascension. In this epistle he admonishes the faithful to be mindful of the great gifts they received from God, and to join all other virtues with their faith. He warns them against false teachers, by describing their practices and foretelling their punishments. He describes the dissolution of this world by fire, and the day of judgment. Ch.—This epistle may be considered as the spiritual testament or last will of the apostle, as it contains his last admonitions to the faithful. He first calls their attention to the care they should have of their sanctification and perfection, next to the perils that concern the Church on the part of heretics, those that menaced her in her infant state, and those that will assail her in the latter days, which includes an invincible proof of her perpetuity; for it is the same infallible and indefectible Church that is to encounter the latter as the former trials, but always with promised success. Hence the great S. John Chrysostom says: the same day that shall see the Church of God ended, shall see the end of the world; and to these continued struggles shall succeed perfect peace, to be enjoyed through a blissful eternity. If some are still found to object, that the present epistle was not written by S. Peter, on account of the marked difference of the style, S. Jerom removes this objection thus: S. Peter employed different interpreters, sometimes Glaucias, and sometimes S. Mark; hence the difference of the style, from the diversity of his scribes. S. Mark was with him when he penned the first, but was not with him when he dictated the present. The present epistle contains, as we said above, an account of the last dreadful trials that are to assail the faithful before the end of time; but all that faith teaches us on that subject is: first, That the world will have an end; secondly, that it will end by fire; and thirdly, that the world will not be destroyed, but changed and perfected. Hence all that is said with regard to the duration of the world; on the nature and quality of the fire that is to burn and purify the world; if it be to precede or follow the last judgment, all is problematical, all is doubtful. Hence the Christian knows a good deal, who knows how to entertain proper doubts.

**This** epistle was always acknowledged for canonical, and written by S. John, the apostle and evangelist. At what time and place, is uncertain. It is sometimes called the Epistle to the Parthians, or Persians. The chief design is to set forth the mystery of Christ’s incarnation against Cerinthus, who denied Christ’s divinity, and against Basilides, who denied that Christ had a true body; with zealous exhortations to love God and our neighbour. Wi.—The same vein of divine love and charity towards our neighbour which runs throughout the gospel, written by the beloved disciple and evangelist, S. John, is found also in his epistles. He confirms the two principal mysteries of our faith: the mystery of the Trinity, the mystery of the incarnation of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The sublimity and excellence of the evangelical doctrine he declares: “And this commandment we have from God, that he who loveth God love also his brother;” (C. 4:21) and again, “For this is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not heavy.” C. 5:3. He shews how to distinguish the children of God from those of the devil; marks out those who should be called antichrists; describes the turpitude and gravity of sin. Finally, he shews how the sinner may hope for pardon. It was written, according to Baronius’s account, sixty-six years after our Lord’s ascension. Ch.—The effect of all is to prove the certainty of the Catholic faith, and to renounce all heretics and schismatics, who entice persons from the true saving faith.

**This** Second and Third Epistles of S. John were not at first received as canonical by all Churches. See Euseb. and S. Jerom, in Catalogo, and Tillemont, art. 9, on S. John, p. 349. The style sufficiently shews they were written by S. John the evangelist. The time and place whence they were written is uncertain. The design in both is to exhort those he writes to, to stand firm in the faith of Christ against all seducing heretics, to love one another, &c. Wi.—But though these last two Epistles of the beloved apostle were frequently contested till the fourth or fifth century, from that period they have been regularly received; and even during the first ages, they were frequently cited by many of the holy Fathers as Catholic Scripture. This short Epistle may still be divided into two parts. The first, a congratulation to the lady he styles *Elect*, in which he felicitates her on account of the faith and virtue he had discovered in some of her children. He exhorts both them and their mother to be more and more confirmed in charity, as the essential and fundamental precept of Christianity, and of which the unequivocal mark is the observance of the other commandments. This part is from the beginning to v. 6, inclusive. The second, which begins with v. 7, and continues to the end, is to put them on their guard against the errors of Simon, of Cerinthus, of the Gnostics, and of Basilides, and prescribes the manner how they are to behave themselves towards these seducers. Though the time and place be uncertain, there is some appearance that it was written from Ephesus, when the apostle governed this Church and all the others of Asia.

**S. John** commends Gaius for his faith, charity, and hospitality towards strangers and the ministers of the gospel, to whom he would have every one to give a kind reception, and such charitable assistance as they can afford, and which others want. Wi.—Gaius, to whom this epistle is addressed, is apparently one of the two disciples of S. Paul, who bore this name. The best known is that of Corinth, with whom S. Paul lodged, and who had been converted and baptized by S. Paul. Others, with greater probability, suppose it was Gaius, of Derbe, mentioned in Acts 20:4. All that we know for certain of this Gaius is, that he was a great friend of S. John, that he exercised hospitality with great zeal and generosity, notwithstanding the harshness and severity of Diotrephes, who appears to have been his bishop, and who was not willing that hospitality should be shewn to the brethren converted from Judaism. S. John promises to visit Gaius, and to reprimand Diotrephes. There is great probability that this letter was carried by the converted Jews, who travelled to diffuse the gospel, and who made a religious point not to enter among the Gentiles, and not to receive any thing from them. It may then be considered as a recommendatory letter in favour of these apostolic men. It appears that great pains were taken to remove the antipathy that existed between these two parties, even after their conversion. The same seeds of division are discernible in S. Paul’s epistles between the Jews and the converted Gentiles: and one of the earliest concerns of this apostle was, to suppress in the Jews all sentiments of vanity and self-sufficiency, which made them prefer themselves to the Gentiles; and in Gentiles a different kind of pride, which caused them to despise the Jews. In the first part of this letter S. John congratulates Gaius on his good works, and recommends to him certain evangelical preachers, who were to deliver him this letter as they called upon him. v. 1, 8. In the second part he complains of Diotrephes, who affected independence, and proposes to Gaius the example of Demetrius, the faithful servant of Jesus Christ, v. 9. ad finem.

**This** Epistle, as we find by Euseb. (l. iii. Hist. c. xxv.) and S. Jerom, (in Catal.) was not everywhere received as canonical till about the end of the fourth age. It is cited by Origen, hom. vii. in Josue; by Tertul. l. de cultu fœminarum; by Clem. Alex. l. iii. Pædag.; by S. Athan. in Synopsi; by S. Greg. Naz. Carm. xxxiv.; by S. Cyr. of Jerusalem, Catech. 4ta.; by the councils of Laodicea and the third council of Carthage; by S. Aug. l. ii. de Doct. Christianâ, c. viii. See Tillemont, and Nat. Alex. in his preface to this epistle. The time when it was written is uncertain, only it is insinuated v. 17 that few of the apostles were then living, perhaps only S. John. The design was to give all Christians a horror of the detestable doctrine and infamous practices of the Simonites, Nicolaites, and such heretics, who having the name of Christians, were become a scandal to religion and to all mankind, as may be seen in S. Irenæus and S. Epiphanius. He copies in a manner what S. Peter had written in his third Epistle, C. ii. Wi.—S. Jude in the first part of his Epistle, (v. 1 to 16) writes against certain heretics of his day, known in history by the name of Gnostics, whose extravagant opinions and shameful and criminal disorders have been described by S. Epiphanius, S. Irenæus, and other Fathers. In the second part, he seems to have principally in view such as were to arise in the latter times; and he exhorts such of the faithful as should live to see those days, to remain firm in the faith which they had received, applying themselves to prayer, persevering in charity, and awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ and eternal life, which He has promised them. S. Jude in thus exerting himself, like S. Peter, against the first and last heresies, has invincibly established the perpetuity of the Catholic Church. With regard to the doubts of certain authors relative to the authenticity of this Epistle, we can oppose Origen, who says that S. Jude wrote a letter, which in the few lines it contains, includes discourses full of force and heavenly grace—Ιουδας εγραψεν επιστολην ολιγοστιχον μεν, πεπληρομενην δε των της ουρανιου χαριτος ερρωμενων λογων.—And S. Epiphanius says, that he believed the Holy Ghost inspired S. Jude with the design of writing against the Gnostics in the letter he has left us.… We find it inserted in the ancient catalogues of sacred Scripture, as in that of the council of Laodicea, can. lx; of Carthage, can. xlvii: nor can there be any reasonable doubt at present for admitting it into the canon of Scripture. It is received by the Catholic Church, and has been received ever since the fourth age. What gave doubts relative to the authenticity of this Epistle, was the author’s quoting a prophecy of Enoch, which seemed to have been taken from a spurious work published under the name of this patriarch, and a fact concerning the death of Moses, not found in the canonical books of the Old Testament; but the apostle might have cited the prophecy of Enoch, and the fact concerning Moses, on the faith of some ancient tradition, without a reference to any book. Eusebius (Hist. Eccles. l. iii. c. xxv.) bears testimony that this Epistle, though not frequently cited by the ancients, was publicly read in many Churches. Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, and the later Fathers, have admitted it as a part of canonical Scripture. Hence Luther, the Centuriators of Magdeburg, and the Anabaptists, have no just reason to look upon this Epistle as doubtful. Le Clerc, in his Hist. Eccles. (an. 90.) acts more candidly in admitting it without any scruple. As for the exception Grotius takes from S. Jude not assuming the quality of apostle, and from its not being universally received in the first ages, we can answer, that S. Peter, S. Paul, S. John, did not take the title of apostles at the head of all their letters, and that some Churches have doubted at first of the authenticity of other writings, which have afterwards been universally acknowledged as authentic and canonical.

**1** *And brother of James*, the apostle and bishop of Jerusalem; he might have added, the brother of Christ, as he and the same S. James are so styled; i.e. cousin germans.—*And called.* That is, to all converted to the faith of Christ, whether they were Jews or Gentiles. Wi.  
**3** Being very solicitous to discharge my duty of an apostle, in writing and instructing you in the common concern of your salvation, I judge it necessary at present to write this letter, to exhort you *to contend earnestly*, [1] and stand firm in the Christian faith. Wi.  
**4** *For there have crept in some men,* *impious* men, (who were of old [2] foretold that they should fall into condemnation, by their own obdurate malice) the disciples of Simon, and the Nicolaites, who endeavour to turn *the grace of our God*, and the Christian liberty into all manner of infamous [3] *lasciviousness;* who, by their ridiculous fables, deny *the only sovereign Ruler, and our Lord Jesus Christ.* Some by *the only sovereign*, or master of all things, understand God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to his divine Person, is the same God, Master, and Lord with him, and the Holy Ghost. But many interpreters think the true sense and construction is this, *denying* Jesus Christ, *our only sovereign master*, [4] *and Lord.* The reasons for this exposition are: 1. That this verse of S. Jude seems correspondent to that of S. Peter, (2 Ep. 2:1) where he says of the same heretics, that they deny *the Lord who bought them*, or deny him that bought them, to be Lord. 2. Because the disciples of Simon denied Jesus Christ to be truly Lord God, but denied not this of the Father. 3. Because the Greek text seems to denote one and the same to be sovereign master and the Lord. See Cornel. a Lapide. Wi.  
**5** *But I will admon* *ish you, that once* [5] (that is, some time ago, when you were converted and instructed) *knew all things* that were necessary as to the Christian faith, I will then put you in mind of the judgments and chastisements that such sinners may expect, *that Jesus*, [6] not as man, but as God, having *saved* the *people* of Israel from their slavery in *Egypt, did afterwards* on several occasions punish and *destroy* *those* among them, *who believed not;* who were rebellious and incredulous to his promises. Wi.—The Greek, and after it the Protestant version, have the *Lord saved;* the Vulgate has *Jesus*, which signifies Saviour, and may in this place be understood of the Word, who from his incarnation took the name of Jesus. V.—Menochius says it means Josue, who is thus styled by the seventy interpreters.  
**6** **Ver.** **6–7** **.** *Principality.* That is, the state in which they were first created, their original dignity. Ch.—*Having given themselves over to* [7] *fornication*, or to excessive uncleanness.—*Going after other flesh*, and seeking unnatural lusts, with those of the same sex. Wi.—Impurity punished by fire and sulphur. Fire is a punishment proportioned to the criminal passion of the voluptuous. That of Sodom was most dreadful, but then it was of short duration. There is another fire that will never be extinguished.  
**8** *In like manner these men* (heretics) *also defile the flesh* with their horrid abominations, *despi* *se* just *dominion*, all lawful authority, as well as ecclesiastical as civil; *blaspheme majesty*, speak ill, and rail both against the majesty of God, and those whom he hath invested with power derived from him. Wi.—*Blaspheme*, &c. Speak evil of them that are in dignity; and even utter blasphemies against the divine majesty. Ch.—The justice of God generally punishes the pride of heart, by abandoning the body to shameful and humiliating abominations, and this we observe in the chief heresiarchs. Their pride makes them rebel against authority; and when once they have got free of this yoke, every other restraint is laughed at.  
**9** *When Michael*, &c. We do not find this in any other canonical Scripture, so that S. Jude must either have had it from some tradition among the Jews, or from some writing which he, by the Spirit of God, knew to be true. It is not expressed on what account this *dispute* or strife was, betwixt S. Michael and the devil, about *the body of Moses.* The common interpretation is, that S. Michael conveyed the body of Moses out of the way, and from the knowledge of the Israelites, lest they should pay to it some idolatrous worship; whereas the devil, for that end, would have it buried, so that the people might know the place and adore it. See Deut. 34:6 where it is said, “and no man hath known of his sepulchre until this present day.” Wi.—*Contended about the body*, &c. This contention, which is no where else mentioned in holy writ, was originally known by revelation, and transmitted by tradition. It is thought the occasion of it was, that the devil would have had the body buried in such a place and manner, as to be worshipped by the Jews with divine honours.—*Command thee*, or, *rebuke thee.* Ch.  
**10** *These men blaspheme whatsoever things they know not*, as it is the custom of false and ignorant teachers: and as to things which they know by their senses, in *these they are corrupted*, following, like brute beasts, their natural lusts and appetites. Wi.  
**11** *They have* imitated, or *gone in the way of Cain*, who murdered his brother; and they have a mortal hatred against the faithful. They have imitated *Balaam* [8] and his covetousness, (see 2 Peter 2:15) *an* *d Core*, (Num. 16) who with others opposed Moses; and as these sinners perished, so will they. Wi.—*Way*, &c. Heretics follow the way of Cain, by murdering the souls of their brethren; the way of Balaam by putting a scandal before the people of God, for their own private ends; and the way of Core or Korah, by their opposition to the church governors of divine appointment. Ch.  
**12** **Ver.** **12–13** **.** *These are sp* *ots in their banquets;* (see 2 Pet. 2:13) in which they commit unheard of abominations, *twice dead*, which signifies no more than quite dead, *clouds without water*, &c. All these metaphors are to represent the corrupt manners of these heretics. Wi.  
**14** *Enoch*, &c. Though the ancient writers mention an apocryphal book of Enoch’s prophesies, yet S. Jude might know by tradition, or by the Spirit of God, what Enoch truly prophesied concerning God’s coming with *thousands of his saints*, to judge, condemn, and punish the wicked for their impieties and blasphemies. Wi.—*Prophesied.* This prophecy was either known by tradition, or from some book that is since lost. Ch.  
**15** Nothing more terrible than a God avenging in the majesty of his power his own cause. Then the impious libertine, in proportion as he has studied to extinguish in himself and to stifle in others the light of faith, the more shall be confounded and overwhelmed with the glory of God in the day of just retribution.  
**16** *S* *peaketh proud things, admiring persons for gain’s sake.* It is a part of the character of these heretics to seem to *admire* and flatter others when they can gain by it. Wi.  
**17** *Be mindful*, &c. He now exhorts the faithful to remain steadfast in the belief and practice of what they had heard from the apostles, who had also foretold that in after times (lit. in the *last time*,) [9] there should be false teachers, scoffing and ridiculing all revealed truths, abandoning themselves to their passions and lusts, who *separate themselves* from the Catholic communion by heresies and schisms; *sensual men*, [10] carried away, and enslaved by the pleasures of the senses. Wi.  
**20** **Ver.** **20–21** **.** *Building yourselves.* That is, raising by your actions a spiritual building, founded 1. upon *faith;* 2. on the *love of God* *;* 3. upon hope, whilst you are *awaiting* for the *mercies* of God, and the reward *of eternal life;* 4. joined with the great duty of *prayer.* Wi.  
**22** *And some indeed reprove, being judged.* He gives them another instruction to practise charity in endeavouring to convert their neighbour, where they will meet with three sorts of persons. 1. With persons obstinate in their errors and sins, these may be said to be already judged and condemned, they are to be sharply reprehended, reproved, and, if possible, convinced of their errors. 2. As to others, you must endeavour to save them, by snatching them as it were out of the fire, from the ruin they stand in great danger of. 3. You must have compassion on others in great *fear*, when you see them, through ignorance or frailty, in danger of being drawn into the snares of these heretics; with these you must deal more gently and mildly, with a charitable compassion, hating always, and teaching others to hate the carnal coat, which is defiled, their sensual and corrupt manners, that defile both the soul and body. Wi.  
**24** **Ver.** **24–25** **.** *Now to him*, &c. S. Jude concludes his epistle with this doxology of praising God, and praying to *the only God, our Savi* *our*, which may either signify God the Father, or God as equally agreeing to all the Three Persons, who are equally the cause of Christ’s incarnation and man’s salvation *through Jesus Christ, our Lord*, who being God from eternity, took upon him our human nature, that he might become our Redeemer. Wi.—To whom, O Lord, can we give the glory of our salvation, unless to thee, to whom all is due? To whom can we consecrate our hearts, but to him who has redeemed them with his blood, sanctified them by his Spirit, and who is to make them happy by his glory? Reign there, O Lord, as on thy throne, now by thy love; that you may reign there hereafter with glory, magnificence, and sovereignty in heaven.
