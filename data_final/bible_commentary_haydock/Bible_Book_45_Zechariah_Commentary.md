# Zechariah Commentary

**Zacharias** began to prophesy in the same year as Aggeus, and upon the same occasion. His prophecy is full of mysterious figures and promises of blessings, partly relating to the synagogue and partly to the Church of Christ. Ch.—He is the “most obscure and longest of the twelve;” (S. Jer.) though Osee wrote the same number of chapters. H.—Zacharias has been confounded with many others of the same name. Little is known concerning his life. Some have asserted that the ninth and two following chapters were written by *Jeremias*, in whose name C. 11:12 is quoted Mat. 27:9. But that is more probably a mistake of transcribers. Zacharias speaks more plainly of the Messias and of the last siege of Jerusalem than the rest, as he live nearer those times. C.—His name signifies, “the memory of the Lord.” S. Jer.—He appeared only two months after Aggeus, and shewed that the Church should flourish in the synagogue, and much more after the coming of Christ, who would select his first preachers from among the Jews. Yet few of them shall embrace the gospel, in comparison with the Gentiles, though they shall at last be converted. S. Jer. ad Paulin. W.

## Chapter 1

**1** Barachias adopted him, (1 Esd. 5:1) or rather Addo was his grandfather.  
**2** *Angry*, as he has severely chastised them. C.  
**3** *Turn ye.* Such expressions admonish us of our free-will, and when we answer, *convert us*, &c. (Lam. 5:11. C.) we confess that God’s grace preventeth us. Trid. Sess. vi. 5. W.—We may *resist* the Holy Spirit, ( H.) and reject his graces. The prophet exhorts the people to lay aside all former negligence, ( C.) and proceed with the temple. H.—It had been commenced about two months before. Agg. 2:1 16.  
**5** *Always.* He seems to hint, that after Malachias prophets would be sent no more till Christ should appear; or, that God’s word should be fulfilled (v. 6) though the prophets were dead. C.  
**6** *Fathers.* They felt their effects. H.—*Returned;* being converted by the sight of God’s judgments. Osee 4:1 and 2 Esd. 1:6.  
**7** *Sabath* *.* These names were brought from Chaldea. The month was lunar, and corresponded sometimes with parts of our December and January, at other times with January, or with that and the following month. C.  
**8** *A man.* An angel in the shape of a man. It was probably S. Michael, the guardian angel of the Church of God. Ch.—It is plain that he was an ange. v. 11. W.—He appears in obscurity, to shew the distress of the nation. C.—*Among.* Sept. “between two shady mountains.” H.  
**10** *These are they*, &c. The guardian angels of provinces and nations. Ch.—The Jews believed that each nation had such an angel, who had to give an account to one in higher authority. God proportions his revelation to their ideas.  
**11** **1** **.** *Rest.* All the country under Michael’s care enjoyed peace, ( C.) in the second year of Darius. H.—The *red horse* implies slaughter. Apoc. 6:4. It was now repressed. Tournemine.  
**12** *The seventieth* *year;* viz. from the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem, in the ninth year of king Sedecias, to the second year of king Darius. These seventy years of the desolation of Jerusalem and the cities of Juda, are different from the seventy years of captivity foretold by Jeremias; which began in the fourth year of Joakim, and ended in the first year of king Cyrus. Ch.—Of these Daniel (9) speaks. The temple had also been destroyed now seventy years, ( W.) and the angel prays, ( H.) while the prophet begs that the people may be inspired to rebuild it. W.—Michael takes occasion from the angels’ report, to beseech the Lord to perfect what had been so well begun. He speaks not expressly of the temple, as Aggeus had prevailed on the people to commence that edifice. They had excused themselves that *the t* *ime was not come*, as they probably dated from the burning of the temple; though its desolation began with the siege, thirty months before. See Jer. 25:11 and 29:10. C.  
**13** *Answered.* We have here a proof of the intercession of angel, and of its good effects. H.—*In me;* revealing God’s will. S. Jer.—Yet it seems to be S. Michael. C. iv. 1. Chal. Theod. C.  
**14** *Zeal.* I will again treat her as my spouse. H.  
**15** *Nations*, represented as four horns, v. 18, 19.—*Evil*, through malice, and thus deserved themselves to be punished. Osee 1:4.  
**16** *Line.* Soon after Nehemias came to rebuild the city. C.  
**18** **Ver.** **18–20** **.** *Four horns, … four smiths.* The four horns represent the empires, or kingdoms, that persecute and oppress the people of God: the *four smiths* or carpenters (for *faber* may signify either) represent those whom God makes his instruments in bringing to nothing the power of persecutors. Ch.—The Ammonites, &c. on the east, the Philistines on the west, the Idumeans and Egyptians on the south, and the Assyrians and Chaldees on the north, had much molested God’s people, and were therefore punished. W.—The princes of Assyria and of Babylon, the kings of Persia and of Egypt, had all treated them ill; and these four empires have or will be destroyed by four chariots, (C. 6:1.) Nabopolassar, Cyrus, Alexander, and Antiochus. Dan. 7:1. &c. S. Jerom, and many who usually follow him, understand the empires of the Chaldeans, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, to be designated by the horns, as the workmen mean the angels who have chastised those nations.  
**21** *Every.* Heb. “at pleasure; none shall lift,” &c. These kingdoms shall no longer prove formidable. C.—*Fray*, or “terrify.” Sept. “to sharpen them in their hands. The horns are nations,” &c. H.

## Chapter 2

**3** *Another.* The angel who measured spoke to Michael. C.  
**4** *Walls.* This must be understood of the spiritual Jerusalem, the Church of Christ. Ch.—According to S. Aug. (in Ps. lxxi.) when the literal sense cannot be verified, we must have recourse to the thing prefigured; and thus what is here written, must be explained of the Church rather than of Jerusalem. W.—A little before the fall of the latter, it was become so populous that the houses which had been built without the walls were enclosed. Jos. Bel. vi. 6.—this multitude was a sort of pledge or figure of the crowds which should embrace the gospel.  
**5** *Fire*, to enlighten and protect it. Arms will be unnecessary. Mic. 5:10. Is. 2:4. The Church shall enjoy peace.  
**6** *North.* Many Jews had not yet returned, Esther, &c.—*Winds.* Ezec. 5:2, 12. C.—Gentiles, and ye children of Sion, flee from Babylon and from sin into the true Church. W.  
**8** *Glory.* After restoring you to your own country, and rebuilding your cities, I will punish your enemies. C.—After they have enjoyed prosperity, they shall feel the reverse. Heb. Cabod, ( H.) means also “a burden.”  
**9** *Prey.* Two years after this ( C.) the Assyrians revolted, and seized Babylon. Justin i.—They slew the useless women: but Zopyrus betrayed the place to Darius, who hung 3,000 of the principal inhabitants, and demolished the walls. Herod. iii. 150. Usher, A. 3489.  
**11** *Nations.* We know of none who embrace the Jewish law. But both the old and the new world submits to Christ.—*Dwell.* S. Michael represents the Messias. The latter preached and wrought miracles among the Jews, which rendered them inexcusable. John 15:24. C.  
**13** *Silent:* obey with reverence. H. See Hab. 2:20 and 1 Mac. 1:3. C.—*Habitation*, becoming man. M.

## Chapter 3

**1** *Jesus*, or Josue, the son of Josedec, the high priest of that time. Ch.—To him this literally refers. W.—As high priest, he represented the nation, whom several calumniated to Darius. 1 Esd. 4. &c. God represses the adversary and adorns his people. It seems something has been done amiss. v. 4. C.—The high priest, (S. Jer.) or rather his sons, have married strangers. Chal. 1 Esd. 10:18. Many Fathers take Jesus for a figure of the Messias, covered with the sins of mankind. C.—But the *Orient* (v. 8) would not thus be promised unto him, (S. Jer.) unless we consider him also as high priest.—Satan*.* Sept. “the devil;” the accuser and calumniator. Apoc. 12:10.  
**2** *The Lord said.* This may refer to the angel, or to the Father and the Son. Ps. 109. Both are styled Jehovah.—*Bread*, alluding to the nation, or to Jesus. Have not the suffered enough? Amos 4:11. C.  
**3** *Garments.* Negligences and sins. Ch.—Jesus had neglected to urge the building of the temple, or to repress unlawful marriages. 1 Esd. 8. W.  
**4** *Change*, such as were worn on festivals. This shewed that the people should exchange adversity for joy.  
**5** *Mitre*, (cydarim) the pontiff’s tiara, of byssus. Ex. 28:4.  
**7** *Judge.* The high priests were at the head till the Machabees. Jos. Ant. xi. 4. and xx. 8.—Yet the nation was, ( C.) till Simon, ( H.) always dependent; and the judges were under foreign kings or governors. C.—*Give thee*, &c. Angels to attend and assist thee. Ch.—They are promised to help the pastors of the Church. W.—They shall give information. v. 9. Ex. 23:20. C.—*Of them.* Sept. “who shall converse in the midst of these who stand:” ( H.) thy children shall succeed in the pontificate. Theod.  
**8** *Portending men.* That is, men who by words and actions are to foreshew wonders that are to come; ( Ch.) or rather they require prodigies before they will take courage to build the temple; or they understand how to explain such things. C.—**Orient**; Christ, who according to his humanity is the servant of God, is called the Orient, from his rising like the sun in the east to enlighten the world. Ch.—S. Luke explains this of Christ, ( W.) recording the words of Zacharias. H.—Christ’s birth was most pure. He gave light to the world. Some would explain this of Zorobabel; but as he was already present, it would seem more applicable to Nehemias. Yet both were only figures of Christ, and could not efface the iniquity of Juda, &c. The Messias is styled the Bud, C. 6:12. Is. 4:2. &c. C.—Tsemach signifies either “the bud or the orient.” H.  
**9** *The stone.* Another emblem of Christ, the rock, foundation, and corner-stone of his Church.—*Eyes.* The manifold providence of Christ over his Church, or the seven gifts of the Spirit of God. Ch.—The Jews were lately returned from a country where seven chief officers were styled “the king’s eyes,” having to inform him of the conduct of governors, &c. Zorobabel shall build the temple, as a figure of Christ establishing his Church. C. 4:10.—*G* *rave.* Sept. “dig a pit.” The rest agree with us. Christ adorns and instructs his Church. C.—*Day.* The day of the passion of Christ, the source of all our good: when this precious stone shall be graved, that is cut and pierced with whips, thorns, nails, and spear. Ch.  
**10** *Tree.* All shall be peace and concord. H.—They shall communicate to each other spiritual goods, abounding in the Church. M.

## Chapter 4

**1** *Again.* He had been with Jesus. C. 3. C.  
**2** *A candlestick*, &c. The temple of God that was then in building; and in a more sublime sense, the Church of Christ. Ch.—Some, with the Jews, apply this to the synagogue: but most explain it of the Church, the lamp denoting Christ, and the seven lights all his pastors; the two olives, Enoch and Elias. Apoc. 11. W.—The angel explains the latter of Jesus and Zorobabel. v. 14. The lights are the same with the angels, (v. 10) and eyes, (C. 3:9) subservient to these great men. Perhaps no candlestick of this description ever existed, though it alludes to that of Moses in some respects. Ex. 37. C.—*Lamp.* Heb. gullah, ( H.) a round vessel for oil. M.—It was filled from the two olive-trees, and supplied the seven lights by tubes. H.  
**5** **Ve** **r.** **5** **.** *Are?* Thou art a prophet, and art thou ignorant? M.  
**6** *To Zorobabel.* This vision was in favour of Zorobabel, to assure him of success in the building of the temple, which he had begun, signified by the candlestick; the lamp of which, without any other industry, was supplied with oil dropping from the two olive-trees, and distributed by the seven funnels or pipes, to maintain the seven lights. Ch.—Zorobabel might thus be comforted with the assurance that God would protect his Church. W.—*Spirit*, represented by the eyes. The Messias would receive the fulness of this spirit. Is. 11:2.  
**7** *Great mountain.* So he calls the opposition made by the enemies of God’s people; which, nevertheless, without any army or might on their side, was quashed by divine Providence. Ch.—It may also mean Sion covered with ruins.—*Chief;* either the first or the last *stone.* C.—*Equal grace.* Shall add grace to grace, or beauty to beauty. Ch.—He shall greatly adorn it. Heb. “when they shall lift it (the stone) up, *they will exclaim:* Let it be agreeable and loved.” C.—Prot. “He shall bring forth the head-stone thereof with shouting, *crying:* Grace, grace unto it.” The people filled the air with their cries, when the temple was founded fourteen years before. H.—This second attempt shall be more successful. The temple was finished in four years. 1 Esd. 5:16. and 6:16. C.  
**10** *Little days.* That is, these small and feeble beginnings of the temple of God. Ch.—Ye of little faith shall rejoice when you shall behold Zorobabel surmounting all difficulties. C.—*Plummet.* Lit. “the stone of tin.” He means the builder’s plummet, which Zorobabel shall hold in his hand for the finishing the building. Ch.—The Hebrew style all weights *stones*, Deut. 25:13. C.—*Eyes.* The providence of God, that oversees and orders all things; ( Ch.) or the assistance of the seven chief angels. Tob. 12:15. Apoc. 1:4. C.  
**12** *Branches:* the divine and human nature in Christ. W.—They are the same with the two trees, v. 11. C.  
**14** *Two sons of oil.* That is, the two anointed ones of the Lord; viz. Jesus, the high priest, and Zorobabel, the prince. Ch.—The Hebrews have hot many adjectives. Thus they say, *the son* *of perdition*, for the lost son. Sept. “sons of fatness.” Aq. and Th. “of splendour;” two illustrious personages. H.—One was head in religious, the other in civil matters. C.—Both were appointed by God, and co-operated for the welfare of the people, as the church and state ought to act for the common good, and assist each other. H.—Jesus and Zorobabel were to repair the damage done by the Chaldeans. They were assisted by the seven *administering* spirits. Heb. 1:14. C.

## Chapter 5

**1** *Eyes* of the soul. M.—*Volume.* That is, a parchment, according to the form of the ancient books, which, from begin rolled up, were called *volumes.* Ch.—Such are still used in the synagogues. They were usually written only on one side. C.—Sept. have read *e* at the end of megilla, and render “a scythe,” ( H.) indicating chastisement. Aquila and Th. have *Diphtherea*, and Sym. Kephalis. S. Jer.—The latter denotes the roller H. to which the parchment was sewed. M.—The former signifies a book written on vellum, particularly that in which the poets say Jupiter marks the sins and punishments of mankind. The prophet saw a volume of this nature. C.—The sins of the people, and the punishment designed for them, were described. It appeared *flying*, to shew that the decree came from heaven. S. Chrys. Il. xxvii. ad pop. W.  
**2** *Cubits*, alluding to Judea, which was twice as long as it was broad. M.—Many explain this vision and that of the woman, (v. 7) of the Jews, ( C.) after S. Jerom. H.—But is seems rather to denote the Chaldeans, whose sentence had been long pronounced, and who were punished by the Persians, and by the Greeks, as by two women. If we understand the Jews, their iniquity was chastised by the Assyrians and Chaldeans. C.  
**3** *In like.* Prot. “shall cut off *as* on that side standing to it.” H.  
**4** *Thief.* Nabuchodonosor is often so styled. S. Jer. iv. 7. This title comprises all the injuries done to man, as he that *sweareth falsely* refers to those where God’s honour is concerned ( C.) more immediately. H.  
**6** *Vessel.* Heb. epha. C.—*Eye.* This is what they fix their *eye* upon, or this is a resemblance and figure of them, viz. of sinners. Ch.—Prot. “resemblance.” H.—This is their picture. C.—Sept. “wickedness;” *aunom* *.* H.—*U* is often mistaken for *i.* S. Jer. Yet here the Sept. seems equally intelligible, v. 8. H.  
**7** *Talent*, or weight, ( H.) called a stone, v. 8.—*Vessel*, like the idol Canopus.  
**8** *He cast.* Heb. ( C.) according to Theodot. (S. Jer.) “She cast herself into the epha,” &c. H.  
**9** *Women.* They often represent nations; and here the Jews understand the Medes and Greeks, who punished the Chaldees. S. Jerom rather thinks that the Assyrians and Chaldeans are meant, carrying away Israel and Juda. Yet the former supposition seems preferable, as the woman in the vessel signified the wickedness of Babylon.—*Kite.* Moderns have, “stork:” the true sense is uncertain. C.—The Jews became blind and hardened on account of their avarice and perjuries. W.  
**11** *the land of Sennaar*, where Babel or Babylon was built; (Gen. 9) where note that Babylon, in holy writ, is often taken for the city of the devil, (that is, for the whole congregation of the wicked) as Jerusalem is taken for the city and people of God. Ch.—Antichrist will begin his reign at Babylon. W.—Yet this is not clear. H.—The Chaldeans are driven from the countries which they had seized, and confined to their own territory, by the Persians and Greeks; or, if we explain it of the Jews, many of them remained at Babylon, and did not return to defile their own country. Only those whose hearts were *touched* by God returned. 1 Esd. 1:5. C.—*Sennaar* means “excussion.” The Jews have been driven by the Chaldees and Romans into all parts. M.

## Chapter 6

**1** *Four chariots.* The four great empires of the Chaldeans, Persians, Greeks, and Romans; or, perhaps, by the fourth chariot are represented the kings of Egypt and of Asia, the descendants of Ptolemeus and Seleucus. Ch. See Dan. 2. W.—The chariots seem to represent the same thing as the four horns, (C. 1:18) namely, the punishment of the four empires. The angel says nothing of the first chariot, as the Chaldeans, who overthrew the Assyrians, were now devoid of power.—*Brass*, or hard; signifying that the chariots were designed to bruise nations. C.—Empires depend on the decrees of God. M.—The two mountains may denote the passes of Cilicia, through which the conquerors must pass from Egypt and Syria to Babylon. Tournemine.  
**2** *Red.* The Chaldeans were bloody towards the Jews, and clothed in red. Nah. 2:3. M.  
**3** *Strong;* (Prot. marg.) the text has “bay.” H.—Some Greek copies read erroneously, red. S. Jer.—Others have, variegated, as v. 7. H.  
**5** *Winds.* These angels go throughout the world to punish. Dan. 10:13. We commonly suppose the tutelar angels to be for the defence of their kingdoms. C.—But they may often promote our real welfare by chastisements. H.—The four monarchies fight like the winds, and soon disappear. M.  
**6** *North.* So Babylon is called, because it lay to the north in respect of Jerusalem. The black horses, that is, the Medes and Persians, and after them Alexander and his Greeks, signified by the white horses, went thither because they conquered Babylon, executed upon it the judgments of God, which is signified v. 8 by the expression of *quieting his spirit.* Ch.—The Persians are *black*, afflicting the Jews under Assuerus, and hindering the temple. M.—Cambyses meditated their utter ruin. C. 2:2. H.—*White.* Alexander was of a beneficent temper when he was not intoxicated. He fought for glory, and was kind to the Jews. C.—*South:* Egypt, which lay to the south of Jerusalem, and was occupied first by Ptolemeus, and then by the Romans. Ch.—The Lagides were some good and some very bad princes, represented by the *grisly* colour. C.  
**7** *Strong.* Sept. “variegated;” ψαροι, ( H.) sturnini. S. Jer.—*Earth.* This well describes the ambition and power of the Seleucides, particularly of Antiochus the great, ( C.) or of the Roman generals down to Cæsar. M.  
**8** *Spirit.* Sept. “wrath or fury.” H.—Nabopolassar overcame the Assyrians, Cyrus the Chaldeans, as Alexander would shortly treat the Persians.  
**10** *Holdai*, &c. They had brought presents for the temple, which are to be used to make crowns for Jesus and Zorobabel. v. 13. C.—The names are interpreted by the Sept. “of the princes and of its useful things, and of those who have known it, (*captivity*) and thou,” &c. H.—Helem and Hem are afterwards mentioned instead of Holdai. v. 14. S. Jer.  
**11** *Crowns.* Chal. “a great crown.” Sept. v. 14. “a crown;” perhaps like the pope’s M.—*Jesus.* When the prophet set the crown on the high priest’s head, in order to shew that it did not belong to him, except as a figure of the Messias, he added, *behold a man*, who is also God, called *Orient*, or “raising up,” and establishing the kingdom, which was promised to David. S. Jer. W.  
**12** **. Orient.** Prot. “the **branch**, and he shall grow up out of his place.” H.—Heb. “under *or* from himself.” This alludes to the miraculous birth of Christ, (Is. 11:1) whom the prophet had principally in view; though his hearers might naturally understand ( C.) Zorobabel, who was to preserve the royal family and build the temple. Theod. S. Jer.—Yet he was only a shadow of the Messias. C. 3:8. C.  
**13** **3** **.** *Glory.* Sept. “virtue,” or “receive strength” and courage, αρετην; ( H.) or one of the crowns, as prince of Juda. v. 10. C.—*Both.* That is, he shall unite in himself the two offices or dignities of king and priest. Ch.—Zorobabel and Jesus shall act in concert. H.  
**14** Helem. Sept. “the crown shall be for those who expect him.” H.—*Hem.* Sept. “for grace.” Heb. chen. S. Jer.—Thus proper names are frequently interpreted. H.—The crowns were not to be worn, but to be deposited in the temple. 1 Mac. 1:23. C.—The names of those four who had contributed towards their making, were to be inscribed upon them. Helem and Hem are the same with Holdai and Josias. M.—The Jews say Hem or Daniel, and his three companions, brought gifts. S. Jer.  
**15** *Off.* Many Jews now assisted in the building, coming from all parts. The temple was thus finished in four years time; whereas Solomon, with all his riches and workmen, spent seven in building one. C.  

---

## Chapter 7

**1** *Casleu*, in our November or December. C.  
**2** *And.* Sept. *from;* (S. Jer.) or, “to Bethel sent Sarasar and Arbesesar, the king and his men, to render the face of the Lord propitious.” H.—These were Persian governors under Darius, (S. Jer.) or Cutheans, (Theod.) or Jews, at a distance from the temple, though in the country. M.—But they seem rather to be some who had not returned. C.  
**3** *The fifth month.* They fasted on the tenth day of the fifth month; because on that day the temple was burnt. Therefore they inquire whether they are to continue that fast after the temple is rebuilt. See this query answered v. 19 of the following chapter. Ch.—The third of the seventh month (v. 5) was also a fast, on account of the death of Godolias, ( C.) during the captivity. 4 K. 25:8. 25. W.—Sept. “Has the sanctification entered hither in the fifth month, as they (*or* I) have done?” &c. H.—Fasting and lamentation are styled sanctification, because they promote it; *curatos quoque s* *anctificat* *;* (S. Jer.) if the proper conditions be observed. H.  
**5** *Years*, from the ruin of the temple till the fourth of Darius.—*Unto me?* Did you grieve for the injury done to me; or was your sorrow caused by your own loss? The prophet gives not a direct answer; but sufficiently shews that exterior works of themselves are of little value. Whether the Jews entered into his sentiments or not, they still observe these fasts, though he said they should be changed into days of rejoicing. C. 8:19. C.—The fast was good, but imperfect, wanting works of charity. S. Greg. W.  
**6** *Yourselves*, to gratify the senses more than from necessity, and without doing it for God’s *glory.* H.  
**7** *Prophets.* He alludes to Is. 58:3. See also Jer. 14:12. Joel 2:12. The Jews were always too much attached to the letter, without minding the spirit of the law, being zealous for corporal rather than for spiritual works.—*South.* Several of these cities were occupied by the Idumeans.—*Plain*, or Sephala, which afterwards became flourishing and populous. C.  
**9** *Judgment.* Avoid sinning, when you fast. W.  
**10** *Devise.* Sept. “wickedly remember in your hearts each one the evil of his brother.” H.  
**11** *Depart*, so to leave the burden on their partner. Heb. C.—Lit. “giving way;” *recedentem* *.* Sixt. V. *recedentes* *.* Sept. “they gave a contemptuous back,” ( H.) like a slave, whom the whip cannot correct.  
**12** **Ve** **r.** **12** **.** *As*, &c. Heb. “of Samir;” a stone used to polish jewels. Sept. “disobedient.”  
**13** *So shall.* It seems the past time would be preferable; as Theodoret, S. Cyr. &c. understand it. C.—Yet the Jews, whom the prophet addressed, were also reprehensible; and they or their posterity felt the effects of God’s *indignation*, when he scattered them throughout the world, as we see at present. Sept. have the future; but Prot. the past tense, “they cried,” &c. H.

## Chapter 8

**2** *Jealous for her*, treating her as a spouse, ( C.) and not neglecting her as one incorrigible. H.  
**3** *Truth.* Idols and infidelity shall reign there no more. The Jews were more faithful after the captivity. But the Church of Christ is alone perfectly chaste. C.  
**6** *Days.* If no prospect of such happiness now appear, is any thing difficult to Omnipotence? H. Lu. 1:37.  
**7** *Sun*, from Chaldea and the islands. This chiefly regards the Christian Church. C.—Assyria and Chaldea lay to the north. The promises are too great for the synagogue. W.  
**8** *Justice.* I will fulfil my promises, if they adhere to virtue. C.  
**10** *Hire*, or “reward;” *merces* *.* H.—All their toils proved useless: ( C.) the land would not yield her fruit. H. See Agg. 2:16.—The temple had now been building two years, and then God sent his prophets and many blessings.—*Neighbour.* Civil broils and the enemy rendered all wretched. 1 Esd. 4.  
**13** *Blessing.* As the nations could wish no greater curse than what you have experienced, so you shall now be regarded as a most happy people.  
**16** *Of peace*, or perfect. Shew no partiality.  
**17** *Friend* means every neighbour, or all mankind. Lu. 10:27. 36. Even thoughts must be guarded. C.  
**19** *Fast.* They fasted on the ninth day of the *fourth* month, because on that day Nabuchodonosor took Jerusalem. Jer. 52:6. On the tenth day of the *fifth* month, because on that day the temple was burnt. Jer. 52:12. On the third day of the *seventh* month, for the murder of Godolias. Jer. 41:2. And on the tenth day of the *tenth* month, because on that day the Chaldeans began to besiege Jerusalem. 4 K. 25:1. All these fasts, if they will be obedient for the future, shall be changed (as is here promised) into joyful solemnities. Ch.—They had only inquired about the fasts of the fifth and seventh months but the two others were also to be omitted in times of joy. W.—The Jews still observe all four. Basnage v. 16.—They fast on the seventeenth of the fourth month, because the breach was then made in the walls, ( C.) and Moses broke the tables of the law, according to the Jews, in S. Jer. The ninth of the fifth month is also kept instead of the tenth, on which day the city was taken by the Chaldees; ( C.) and the Romans burnt the temple in the same month, as the Israelites had then formerly been sentenced to wander in the desert. S. Jer.—It would be difficult for the Jews to prove all these assertions.  
**22** *Lord.* Many were converted in the days of Esther, (8:17) and the Pharisees were eager to make proselytes in all parts, when Christ preached. Mat. 23:15. Acts 2:11. Yet we must go to the Church to see this fully accomplished. C.  
**23** *Ten men*, &c. Many of the Gentiles became proselytes to the Jewish religion before Christ; but many more were converted to Christ by the apostles and other preachers of the Jewish nation. Ch.—*Skirt*, or hem, by which the Jews were distinguished. Num. 15:38. Mat. 9:20. C.

## Chapter 9

**1** *Burden.* Preaching of the truth is disagreeable to infidels, and light to the faithful. W.—Hadrach; Syria, ( Ch.) or a city near Damascus, on which it rested. The victories of Alexander and of the Machabees are here described. The former defeated the Arabs near Damascus, (which was betrayed to Parmenio) and having gained the victory at Issus, became master of Celosyria, of which he made Parmenio governor. C.—*Rest.* Sept. “his sacrifice, for the Lord looks on men and on all the tribes of Israel.” H.—He wished for the conversion of all, and those who turn to him are not rejected. S. Jer.  
**2** Emath, or Emesa, not far from Damascus. C.—It shall also fall a prey to Alexander. H.—*Tyre* was become again very rich and strong, ( C.) and gloried in its wisdom; yet was taken after a long and obstinate resistance ( H.) of seven months, when the inhabitants were slain or sold, the city demolished, and the ships sunk. Curt. iv. Usher, A. 3672.—*Sidon* made no resistance, as it hated the Persians. Yet Strabo was forced to resign the throne to Abdolonymus, (Arian ii. Just. xi.) which indicates some opposition. C.  
**5** *Ascalon* was ruined. The other cities opened their gates, as Jerusalem did. Jos. Ant. xi. ult.—Batis alone resolved to defend Gaza. He was dragged round the city when it was taken, after a siege of two months; the inhabitants were slaughtered or sold, and others brought in their stead. Curt. iv. Diod. Oly. cxii.  
**6** *Divider.* Heb. mamzer; “bastard,” or rather “stranger.” It is reported that Alexander was the illegitimate son of Nestabanes, whom Olympius took for Jupiter. Plut. Just. xi.—But these might be popular reports. The sequel seems to shew that the Jews, &c. occupied the towns of the Philistines under the Machabees. Chal. Grot. C.—The *divider* may denote any conqueror. M.  
**7** *His blood.* It is spoken of the Philistines, and particularly of Azotus, (where the temple of Dagon was) and contains a prophecy of the conversion of that people from their bloody sacrifices and abominations to the worship of the true God. Ch.—Many pagans devoured the victims raw, and drank the blood of their enemies. These marks of cruelty and superstition shall cease when they adopt the law of Moses. Gen. 9:4. Lev. 7:26 and 17:11.—*Governor*, or city of a thousand: ( C.) Heb. alup. Mic. 5:2. H.—*Jebusite.* They probably embraced the faith with Areuna. 2 K. 24:16. The city was formerly styled Jebus. The towns of the Philistines shall not be distinguished from the rest, under the dominion of Juda. See 1 Mac. 5:66 and 10:78. C.  
**8** *War;* the Machabees. Ch.—They stood up like a wall for the people and the temple. C.—Heb. “my house, on account of those going,” &c. I will protect it better than an army. H.—After the Machabees, God preserved the temple from profanation till he abandoned it after the death of Christ. C.—Yet Pompey penetrated into the most holy place, and Crassus plundered the treasury. Both felt the effects of their impiety, and had no farther success.—*Oppressor;* tax-gatherer, ( H.) sent by foreign tyrants. M.—Till the Machabees, particularly Hircan, ( C.) or Simon, his father, ( H.) threw off the yoke, the Jews were always subject ( C.) either to the Persians, to Syria, or to Egypt. H.—Hircan’s son, Aristobulus, took the title king, and governed in peace. C.  
**9** **. King.** Christ often came to Jerusalem; but his last entrance, to die for man’s redemption, was most excellent. W.—If the Jews had not wilfully blinded themselves, they could not mistake Him, as he is here so minutely described, possessing the most humble and the noblest qualities. Not knowing how to reconcile them, they feign one Messias glorious and another poor and despised; while others admit only of one, and reject either the abject or the exalted things which the prophets have spoken of him. The Church alone can reconcile these apparent contradictions in our Saviour’s character. After predicting what would befall the Jews till about one hundred years before the birth of Christ, the prophet turns to Him who was the desire and comfort of the nation. C.—*Saviour.* Heb. Noshah, ( H.) or *Jesus.* S. Jer.—*Poor;* or *meek*, as S. Matthew quotes it, after the Sept. and Chal. M.—They have read *v* for *i*, as *hani* ( H.) means *poor.* C.—Prot. “lowly,” which may signify devoid of riches, or of pride.—*Ass.* Sept. “yoked animal, and upon a young foal.” H.—The former denotes the Jews.  
**10** *Chariot.* Arms shall be useless. Mic. 5:10.—*Earth.* This can be understood only of Christ’s kingdom, ( C.) though it alludes to the greatest limits of the promised land. H.  
**11** *Wat* *er;* from limbo, (S. Jer. &c. W. S. Tho. iii. p. q. 52. a. 1. C.) and purgatory. See S. Aug. de Gen. xii. 23. & ep. 99. M.—Christ delivered the ancient patriarchs by virtue of his covenant, just sealed with his blood. Heb. at present reads, “and as for thee, *Sion*, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners,” &c. delivering the Hebrews out of Egypt by the paschal lamb. Chal. But this text is suspected, as S. Jerom remarks no variation.  
**12** *Hold.* Return ye, who stay behind, to Jerusalem. God will make good all that you abandon; or come, Judas has procured liberty for the people. 1 Mac. 4:36. C.—Embrace the gospel, and enter the Church. M.  
**13** *Juda:* the Machabees. S. Jer.—*Filled*, or stretched the bow of Ephraim. C.—The people shall act with vigour and union. H.—*Sons* *;* viz. the apostles, who, in the spiritual way, conquered the Greeks, and subdued them to Christ. Ch.—The Machabees repressed the insolence of the Seleucides, who were of Greek extraction.  
**14** *Se* *en.* God miraculously interposed in favour of the Machabees, and his angels appeared at their head. 1 Mac. 2:22 and 5:2. and 10:29. and 11:8. and 15:15. A handful of men thus routed vast armies, and asserted their independence, avenging religion and the state, which they restored to greater splendour.—*South*, whence storms usually arise in that country. Job 37:9. The angels confounded the enemy. 1 Mac. 10:30.  
**15** *Sling.* At first the Machabees had no other weapon. 1 Mac. 4:6. The sling was much used. Judg. 20:16.—*Wine.* They will shed blood of the enemy so abundantly, and be all besmeared with it. They would never drink it, like the pagans. Lev. 17:10. C.  
**16** *Holy stones;* the apostles, who shall be as pillars and monuments in the Church. Ch.—The Machabees are like a wall. They restore the altar of holocausts, built of fresh stones. 1 Mac. 4. C.  
**17** *The corn*, &c. His most excellent gift is the blessed Eucharist, called here *the corn*, that is, the bread *of the elect*, and the *w* *ine springing forth virgins*, that is, *maketh virgins* to bud, or spring forth as it were like flowers among thorns, because it has a wonderful efficacy to give and preserve purity. Ch.—It enables the weak to despise all things for the sake of virtue, and makes them fruitful and eloquent, as the original implies. C.—Sept. “a fragrant wine for virgins.” H.—Christ is the grain of wheat, which dying, brings forth much fruit, (Jo. 12) and “of this wheat that bread is made which came from heaven.” Jo. 6. S. Jer. W.—“How shall not they have joy, who being inebriated with the cup of *our* Saviour, are made virgins?” This was partly verified in the days of the Machabees, to whom plenty was granted. S. Jer. H.—Those who partake worthily of the blessed Eucharist, become strong and pure. M.—Prot. “corn shall make the young men cheerful, (marginal note: grow, *or* speak) and new wine the maids.” H.

## Chapter 10

**1** *Snows.* Prot. “Bright clouds,” or “lightnings.” H.—God will presently grant your requests, after the persecution of Epiphanes. C.—The *latter season* is when fruit ripens, the acceptable time to sue for grace. W.  
**2** *Vanity.* Jason prevailed on many to imitate the Gentiles. 1 Mac. 1:12.  
**3** *Goats;* the leaders of the people. Jer. 50:8. C.—*Vir gregis ipse caper* *.* Virg. Ec. 7.—Jason died in exile, Lysimachus was slain in the temple, Alcimus perished miserably, and Menelaus was hurled among ashes. 2 Mac. 5:5 and 4:39. and 13:4. and 1 Mac. 9:54.—*Battle.* The apostates have suffered: God will not abandon his flock, but raises up Mathathias, &c.  
**4** *Corner*, to connect the building. The Machabees were not of the tribe of Juda; but it was the chief, and gave name to the rest. Judas was also a figure of Christ, the chief corner-stone, and he should be born of that tribe.—*Pin*, to fasten down the tent, or to hang things upon. These comparisons were not deemed mean, 1 Esd. 9:8. and Is. 22:23.—*Exactor.* The term may have a good as well as a bad sense. Taxes must be paid for the support of lawful governments. Judas forced other nations to pay tribute. C.—The same term in Ethiopia, means “a king.” De Dieu.  
**5** *Riders.* The Syrians, with ( H.) all their cavalry, were routed by a few ill-armed infantry. C.  
**6** *Joseph.* All the tribes shall embrace the gospel at last. W.—*Back*, from the caverns to which they had fled.  
**7** *Valiant.* Ephraim was a powerful and valiant tribe. Deut. 33:17. C.  
**8** *Whistle.* Christians are sweetly drawn by inspirations, without clamorous words. S. Cyr. W.—This expression shews the sovereign dominion of God. C.—Sept. “I will give them a sign.” H.  
**9** *Me.* The Jews were spread throughout the world, and adhered to their own customs. Philo. See Acts 2:8.—While they enjoyed the greatest prosperity, they kept together in a small territory. It is wonderful how they have since increased.  
**10** *For them.* They returned from the places to which they had been dispersed during former wars, when Judas had liberated his country. C.  
**11** *Sea.* The Jews pretend that the Bosphorus’ straits were dried up, to afford them a passage. S. Jer.—But they must produce some stronger text to prove such a miracle. No obstacles shall be able to retard God’s people. Is. 11:16.—*Assyria.* After Epiphanes, the kingdom subsisted only about seventy years.—*Egypt.* The Ptolemies excluded the natural princes, who have never regained the throne. They who had so often disturbed the Jews, were deprived of their power over them by the Syrians, and never could prevail there again after the Machabees. C.—When the faithful are confirmed in their religion, the enemy cannot hurt them. W.

## Chapter 11

**1** *Gates.* Josephus (Bel. vii. 12.) relates, that the heavy eastern gates flew open at midnight: and the priests officiating at Pentecost, heard a multitude crying, “Let us go hence.” See Tacit. Hist. v. Johanan then declared, “O temple, I know thou wilt so be destroyed,” as Zac. foretold, *Open*, &c. Kimchi, Lyr. &c. C.—*Libanus* *.* So Jerusalem, and more particularly the temple, is called by the prophets, from its height, and from its being built of the cedars of Libanus. Ch. Is. 10:34. Ezec. 17. S. Jer.—The destruction of both by Titus is predicted. W.—*Cedars.* Thy princes and chief men. Ch. W.  
**2** *Fir* and *oak* may signify the cities and towns of the Jews.—*Fenced.* Sept. “well planted;” ( C.) or “forest, planted all at once.” H.—“The temple was like a fortress.” Tacit.  
**3** *Pride*, or farther banks, covered with shrubs, among which lions dwelt. Jer. 50:44. C.  
**4** *Feed*, thou Zacharias; ( M.) or the prophet announces what God will do.—*Slaughter*, whom Herod and his successors, the Zealots, Eleazar, Simon, and John, so cruelly oppressed and brought to ruin. C.  
**6** *Hand.* This alludes to the last siege of Jerusalem, in which the different factions of the Jews destroyed one another, and they that remained fell into the hands of their king, (that is, of the Roman emperor) of whom they had said, (Jo. 14:15.) *We have no king but Cæsar.* Ch.—The besieged slew each other daily, so that Vespasian did not hurry. Jos. Bel. v. 2. and vi. 1.  
**7** *For this.* Christ came to feed his flock. C.—But the Jews would not receive him. H.—Sept. read ( C.) *locnani*, as v. 11, “of slaughter into Chanaan, and I,” &c. H.—*Two rods*, or shepherds’ staves, meaning the different ways of God’s dealing with his people; the one by sweet means, called the rod of *Beauty*, the other by bands and punishments, called the *Cord.* And where both these rods are made of no use or effect by the obstinacy of sinners, the rods are broken, and such sinners are given up to a reprobate sense, as the Jews were. Ch.—The first denotes God’s general providence, as it is most seemly that all should be under him; the second means his particular care of the Jews. W.—God uses both the crook and the whip, employing both severity and tenderness. Now all proves in vain.  
**8** *Month.* That is, in a very short time. By these *three shepherds* probably are meant the latter princes and high priests of the Jews, whose reign was short. Ch.—Ismael, Joseph, and Ananus, all obtained the dignity in one year; and as they and their predecessors were actuated by avarice, they could not fail being displeasing to God. Galba, Otho, and Vitellius were likewise cut off in little more than a year, when Vespasian succeeded, and his son took Jerusalem. C.—The Jews pretend that Moses, Aaron, and Mary are here meant. S. Jer.—But what reference can the prophet have to them?  
**9** *Not feed.* This is the final sentence. God allowed them thirty-seven years to repent, after the death of Christ.  
**10** *All people.* Hereupon all fell upon the Jews.  
**11** *Poor* converted to Christ, ( C.) who retired to Pella, (Eus. Hist. iv. 5.) as they had been warned of the impending storm. Mat. 24:1. Lu. 21:20.  
**12** *Pieces.* Sicles are usually understood. About fifty-one livres. The Jews bought the life of Christ for this sum; ( C.) thirty pieces. W.  
**13** *The statuary.* The Heb. word signifies also *a potter*, ( Ch.) and this seems to be the true meaning. Mat. 27:3. The prophet is ordered to *bring*, thus to indicate what should be done by the traitor. C.—Sept. “cast them into the crucible to see if it (*the metal*) be good, as I have been tried by them.” H.  
**14** *Israel.* The latter remained obstinate, ( C.) while Juda, the real “confessor,” ( H.) embraced the gospel. After the destruction of the temple, the Jewish ceremonies were no longer ( C.) observed or tolerated in the Church, as they had been, in order that the synagogue might be buried with honour. S. Aug. H.—The Jews are rejected. W.  
**15** *A foolish shep* *herd.* This was to represent the foolish, that is, the wicked princes and priests that should rule the people, before their utter destruction. Ch.—Caligula, Claudius, or Nero, monsters of stupidity, may also be meant. To such the Jews preferred to submit: but they soon found out their mistake, when it was too late. Caligula and Nero would be adored in the temple!  
**16** *Hoofs*, with excessive travelling. C.—They shew no pity, but are wholly intent on their own pleasures. H.  
**17** *Shepherd.* Sept. “ye who feed foolish things, forsaking,” &c. H.—Heb. “shepherd of nothing.”—*Darkened.* Caligula was slain, and had not sense to know what was for this real interest. His wife and only daughter were murdered. See Jos. Ant. xix. 1. Suet.—His maxim was, “Let them hate, provided they fear;” and he wished the Romans had “all but one neck,” that he might cut it off. C.—Antichrist, the destroyer, shall perish. W.  

---

## Chapter 12

**2** *A lintel of surfeiting.* That is, a door into which they shall seek to enter, to glut themselves with blood: but they shall stumble, and fall like men stupified with wine. It seems to allude to the times of Antiochus, and to the victories of the Machabees. Ch.—Yet it indirectly relates to the last siege of Jerusalem, and to Jesus Christ establishing his Church. Heb. “a cup of drowsiness,” or trembling. C.—Sept. “as courts (or thresholds; προθυρα) shaken.” H.—Jerusalem first drank the cup herself; and then under the Machabees, made others suffer.—*Juda.* Never before Epiphanes had the Jews fought against their brethren. Then the apostates became most terrible. 1 Mac. 1:55 and 2:7, 19. C.—Thus none persecute the Catholic faith more than those who have perfidiously abandoned it. H.—When the gospel began to be preached, the obstinate Jews opposed it. Acts 4. &c. W.  
**3** *Stone.* It was customary to have such huge stones for people to try their strength. S. Jer.—Ruptures and wounds were frequently the consequence. Eccli. 6:22. The nations which attacked God’s people, paid dear for their victory. C.—All fight against the Church; ( M.) yet she prevails. H.  
**4** *Blindn* *ess.* The cavalry of the Syrians proved useless against a few ( C.) champions under God’s protection. H.  
**5** *Let.* Sept. “We shall find for us the inhabitants of Jerusalem, in the Lord Almighty, their God.” H.—Judas always exhorted his men to trust in the Lord. 1 Mac. 3:18. C.—*Mocbai*, the initials of “who *is* like thee among the strong, (Alim) O Lord,” (Ex. 15:11. H.) is supposed to have been his motto, ( C.) written on his banners; and some assert, that it occasioned the appellation of Machabee. H.—“Strengthen for me.” Aquila.  
**6** *Furnace.* Sept. “firebrand among wood, and as a burning lamp amid straw.” H.—*Left.* The Samaritans shall fall as well as the Idumeans.—*Place.* The temple and city had been deserted, while the troops of Epiphanes occupied the citadel. 1 Mac. 3:45 and 4:38.  
**7** *David.* The Machabees were not of this family, but Levites, born at Modin, in Ephraim. C.  
**8** *Hath.* Sept. “is weak.”—*Offended.* Such shall repent and be pardoned, like David. H.—They shall imitate his valour. The posterity of David shall no more cause the people to go stray.—*Of God.* He seems to allude to Christ’s birth. David’s offspring shall not ascend the throne; but their virtue shall be conspicuous; they shall give birth to Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. C.  
**10** *Prayers.* Sept. and Chal. “pity.” H.—After the Machabees more synagogues were erected, and the people were more faithful; yet this chiefly regards the new law, in which the spirit prays with us ineffably. Rom. 8:26. C.—*Me.* So far the prophet speaks in Christ’s name. He afterwards relates how the people will grieve for *him*, beating their breasts. Lu. 23:48. This was clearly verified in Christ. John 19:31. M.—But in the gospel we read, *him whom they have pierced*, as the context seems here to require. H.—Some Hebrew copies read in like manner, ( C.) the Erfurth MS. 2. having aliu, “on him,” though Michaelis remarks not this important variation. The Jewish transcriber would not alter his text to make it conformable to the New Testament. Kennicott—Sept. “they shall look upon me for having insulted,” *or* skipped. C.—Yet “S. John did not much regard what the Greek contained, but interpreted word for word as he had read in Hebrew,” as the other sacred writers did when there was any material difference. S. Jerom, quoted by Kennicott. Dis. ii. p. 347, &c. H.—Adopting this reading, we may explain this of Judas, whom the people greatly bewailed. 1 Mac. 9:20. He was a figure of Christ, whom the prophet had chiefly in view. All the Jews who embraced the faith verify this prediction, ( C.) as those particularly did who had been instrumental to the death of our Saviour, and afterwards entered into themselves. Acts 2:37. Both Jews and Gentiles have all contributed by their sins to crucifying their Lord; and, at the last day, all shall look *on him* as their judge or as their deliverer.—*Pierced.* Heb. dakaru. H.—Sept. have transposed *d* and *r*, which are very similar, and read rokdu, “have danced,” or derided. S. Jer.—The original implies, have outraged or blasphemed, as well as pierced. They shall henceforward cease to despise God and his law. C.  
**11** *Adadremmon* *.* A place near Mageddon, where the good king Josias was slain, and much lamented by his people. Ch.—It was not far from Jezrahel. 2 Par. 35. The lamentation for Josias represents that of impenitent sinners at the day of judgment. S. Jer. W.—Sept. translate the proper names, “of the pomegranate which is cut down in the field.” H.—All from v. 8 may be explained of Judas.  
**12** *Apart.* Bands of men and of women mourning, went with musical instruments separately through the streets, and into the country; as they still do in the East. C.—On such occasions, as well as in times of prayer, continence is observed. S. Jer.  
**13** *Nathan.* Zorobabel was his descendant.—*Semei*, the son of Gershom. 1 Par. 6:16. C.—“From this tribe the doctors are chosen.” S. Jer.—The pious of all ranks bewail the death of Christ, and the share which they had in it. H.—He had done good to many; and therefore we may presume that many would grieve in every tribe. M.

## Chapter 13

**1** *Fountain.* In the New Testament Christ is made an open fountain by his incarnation. John 4:13. S. Greg. xx. in Ezec. i. 6. ep. 186. W.—His baptism and other sacraments have the most surprising effects, to which the prophet refers more than to those waters which were brought by pipes into the temple to cleanse the victims. Ezec. 47:1. C.—The *washing.* Sept. “change and sprinkling.” Grabe substitutes χωρισμον, “separation,” and marks the verse with an asterisk. The legal impurities shall be effaced. H.  
**2** *No more.* After the Machabees, the people were free from idolatry, and magical arts were repressed. Osee 2:16. Ezec. 37:22. C.—“Idolatry and heresy are punishable by death, in the law of Christ.” W.—To judge in these matters belongs only to the Church. H.  
**3** *Not* *live.* The law condemned those prophets to death, who attempted to lead the people into idolatry. Deut. 13:1. People shall be so zealous for God’s honour, that the parents of the seducer shall themselves ( C.) bring him to judgment. H.—*Through*, or make some mark upon him, as fugitive slaves, &c. were stigmatized. C.—Sept. “shall shackle.” H.—These before interpreted *dakar*, danced, or insulted. The others have in both places, “pierced.” S. Jer.—The person was not slain. v. 6.  
**4** *Vision.* They shall have no appearance of truth.—*Sackcloth.* Heb. “hairy skin;” adereth. Such were used by kings. Jon. 3:6. The people shall not be deceived by such appearances, so that these garments will not be used. The Jews have always been ready to receive impostors. Mat. 7:15. Yet they shall not be so frequent, or dangerous. The prophets used coarse hairy garments. 4 K. 1:8.  
**5** *Husbandman.* Worldly occupations were incompatible with the office of prophets. 3 K. 19:20. Amos 7:15. Mat. 4:20. The ( C.) false ( H.) prophets will become so odious, that people will excuse themselves from taking up the calling.—*Example.* I am condemned like him to labour. Gen. 3:17. Sept. “a man begot me.” Heb. “taught, *or* bought me, ( C.) *or* caused me to work.” De Dieu.  
**6** *Loved me.* My parents marked me thus. v. 3. C.—Some have understood this of Jesus Christ. Rupert. S. Tho.—But the context excludes this interpretation, which would be injurious to him. C.—The false prophet is reformed by his parents’ correction, so that he applies to agriculture, and owns that he had been justly punished. S. Jer. H.  
**7** *Sw* *ord.* This address rouses attention. C.—The sword implies all the torments which Christ endured. W.—He explains this of himself; only instead of *strike*, he says *I will strike*, (Mat. 26:31) as the sword was directed by God. H.—*Patris voluntate percussus est* *.* S. Jer.—*Cleaveth.* Heb. hamithi, “my amiable one;” ( H.) “of the same tribe with me;” (Aq.) “of my people.” Sym. S. Jerom observes, that Sept. and Th. have read *v* for the last *i*, and render “his neighbour,” or *citizen.* Yet some editions of the Sept. retain “my fellow-citizen.” H.—*Little ones.* Sept. Arab. &c. “shepherds,” ( C.) which “many ill apply to the Jewish princes.” S. Jer.—Tsoharim means also “the little.” Mic. 5:2. Christ takes care of his little flock, (Lu. 12:32. H.) and is always one with the Father. Jo. 8:29 and 10:30. C.—He recalled the flying apostles, and gave them courage. W.  
**8** *Third.* The greatest part of mankind will be lost. H.—The few Jews who embrace the faith will be absorbed in the Gentile converts, and suffered to live, though proved by persecutions, while the rest shall be exterminated. Both shall lose their name, and be styled Christians. C.—Those who adhere to Judaism, or to paganism, cannot be saved. This is the privilege only of Christian Catholics, who live piously, and are selected by God’s grace. W.  
**9** *Fire.* The Church was persecuted during the first centuries; but always became more pure, and the blood of martyrs increased her numbers. C.—She faithfully adhered to *God.* H.—The Jews say this will not take place at last: “but we assert that it is already accomplished.” S. Jer.

## Chapter 14

**1** *Midst.* The obstinate Jews shall be destroyed. They became their own enemies. C.—The Zealots committed the greatest excesses during the siege. Jos. Bel. v. 1.—Tacitus also refers to these transactions, having written thirty volumes on the Cæsars, from Augustus to Domitian’s death.” S. Jer.  
**2** *I will gather*, &c. This seems to be a prophecy of what was done by Antiochus, ( Ch.) or of the last siege, ( W.) by the Romans. S. Jer. Theod. Eus. Dem. vi. 18. C.—Vespasian collected numerous forces. Jos. Bel. iii. 1.—Titus had six legions and many auxiliaries, Arabs, &c. Tacit. Hist. v.—Various nations composed their army. W.—*Rifled*, or demolished. None was left standing. Jos. B. vii. 6. Heges. v. 49.—S. Jerom and others think that the city on Sion was spared, ( C.) and 40,000 were permitted to dwell where they had a mind. Jos. B. vii. 15.—But it is not said that they continued at Jerusalem. Half the Jews therefore perished, and those who maintained the siege found a grave in the city. Theod.—*Half* only denotes a considerable part, as v. 8. Those who followed our Saviour’s admonition, retired before, and were safe ( C.) at Pella. C. 10:11. Sept. “the rest of my people shall not be destroyed out of the city.”  
**3** *Shall.* Sept. “will stand in battle array among,” &c. (παραταξεται εν) though he will one day punish the victorious Romans. H.—Now he fought with them as Heb. may signify. C.—Various prodigies made this clear: (Jos. B. vii. 12. 16.) so that Titus would not receive the crown which was presented to him, as he looked upon himself only as the instrument employed by divine justice. Philost. vi. 14.—This sense is given by S. Cyr. &c. C.—In the days of Epiphanes, God defeated his projects. H.  
**4** *Olives.* Here the tenth legion was stationed, (Jos. B. vi. 3.) on the spot where Christ had denounced this judgment, and ascended into heaven. Lu. 19:41. Acts 1:12.—*South.* We cannot shew the literal accomplishment. If it regard the latter times, this must be hidden. But it suffices that some great earthquake should take place, according to most interpreters; or rather, ( C.) the Romans removed vast quantities of earth and stone. Jos. B. vi. 12. Grot.—Olivet has three tops; the southern one is the lowest. But whether this was caused by an earthquake we know not. The rocks are said to split, &c. when God displays his power and affords some miraculous assistance. Ps. 17:8. Is. 24:8. Hab. 3:10.  
**5** *Flee.* Whle the siege was forming many escaped, according to Josephus. Heb. Sept. &c. “The vale of my mountain shall be filled up, for,” &c. C.—Yet Prot. agree with us. H.—*Those* should be “my.” Ribera. M.—*The next.* Prot. and Sept. “reach unto Azal.” H.—*You shall.* Sept. &c. “and it shall be filled, as it was filled at the earthquake,” &c. C.—The Romans had to raise many works in the vale of Cedron, so that the trees all round were cut down, and the garden walls removed thither. Jos. B. vi. 4. 14.—*Ozias*, when he attempted to offer incense. Jos. Ant. ix. 11. Amos 1:1 and 4 K. 15:15.—Yet the earthquake is not specified in the sacred historical books. W.—On that occasion, the people retired into the vale formed by the separation of Olivet; or, if we follow the Sept. part of that mountain fell into the valley of Cedron, which we find nowhere else specified. C.—*With him.* Prot. “thee.” H.—God is attended by his angels; though the Romans may be called his *saints*, or people destined to execute his decrees in this war. Is. 13:3. Soph. 1:7. Deut. 33:3. Joel 3:1. C.  
**6** *No light;* viz. in that dismal time of the persecution of Antiochus, when it was *neither day nor night*, (v. 7) because they neither had the comfortable light of the day, nor the repose of the night. Ch.—Darkness denotes distress. The citizens shall be in despair. Mat. 24:29. Ezec. 22:8. Joel 2:2. Apoc. 11:2. Heb. seems to be corrupt: “no precious light, but thick,” or a cloud. C.  
**7** *In the time of the evening there shall be light.* An unexpected light shall arise by the means of the Machabees, when things shall seem to be at the worst. Ch.—At one period of the last siege, it was dubious what would be the event, particularly ( C.) when Titus was separated from almost all his attendants, and when the besieged burned the works of the enemy. Jos. B. vi. 2. and 12.  
**8** *Living waters;* viz. the gospel of Christ. Ch.—*Last:* Mediterranean. H.—The prophet now turns to the figurative Jerusalem. The earthly city was not well supplied with water. C.—It was in the most dry and barren part of the country. S. Jer. in Is. xlix.—As much as the Mediterranean excels the Dead Sea, so much do the Gentiles surpass the Jewish converts in numbers. See C. 13:1. C.—The true faith is Catholic in all places, and at all times. W.  
**9** *One Lord.* The apostles justly gave this title to Christ. Jo. 13:14. He is possessed of all power. Mat. 28:18. Phil. 2:10. Pastors are all subject to him. C.—The Pope styles himself, “servant of the servants of God,” since S. Gregory’s time. H.  
**10** *Return.* This in some measure was verified by means of the Machabees; but is rather to be taken in a spiritual sense, as relating to the propagation of the Church and kingdom of Christ, the true Jerusalem, which alone shall never fall under the anathema of destruction, or God’s curse. Ch.—The limits of Jerusalem were never so extensive.—*Hill*, or Gabaa to Remmon,” or the pomegranate. The situation is not ascertained.  
**11** *Anathema.* It shall not be sentenced to utter ruin. The Church may suffer losses, but cannot perish. C.  
**12** *Consume.* Such judgments as these have often fallen upon the persecutors of God’s Church, as appears by many instances in history. Ch.—This has partly been verified in persecuting emperors, (S. Jer.) and in others, and will befall the wicked when the day of judgment shall draw near. W.—Herod, who made war on Christ, and Agrippa, who attacked his Church, ( C.) were both devoured by worms. Jos. Ant. xvii. 9. and xix. 7. Acts 12:13.—Nero slew himself; Maximian was eaten to death by an inward ulcer; and his colleague’s (Maximinus) eyes fell from his head. Eus. in Constant. i. 57. and 59.—It would seem as if Zacharias beheld them. He may also speak of the attempts of God, and of Epiphanes. C. 2:8 and 12:9.  
**13** *Them.* The Church shall be alarmed at these wars, seeing enemies on all sides. But those days shall be shortened. Mat. 24:21.—*Hand* *.* Christians shall assist each other; or rather the nearest relations will persecute them. Mat. 10:21. 36. C.  
**14** *Even Juda*, &c. The carnal Jews, and other false brothers, shall join in persecuting the Church. Ch.—The Jews shewed themselves the most virulent. 2 Cor. 11:24. Acts 8. &c. They insisted on the death of S. Polycarp.—*Riches.* Converts shewed their generosity so much, ( C.) that Julian and Felix, apostates, complained of this profusion in sacred *vessels.* Theod. Hist. ii. 11. 12.  
**15** *Shall be like this destruction.* That is, the beasts shall be destroyed as well as the men; the common soldiers as well as their leaders. Ch.—History does not specify the death of cattle, ( C.) though in plagues this would inevitably follow; and the pagans complained that they were become more common since the propagation of the gospel. H.—The reverses which the troops of Dioclesian, &c. sustained, were to punish their enmity to religion. C.  
**16** *Left.* That is, many of them that persecuted the Church shall be converted to its faith and communion, ( Ch.) particularly after Constantine. C.—*Tabernacles.* This feast was kept by the Jews, in memory of their sojourning forty years in the desert, in their way to the land of promise. And in the spiritual sense, is duly kept by all such Christians as in their earthly pilgrimage are continually advancing towards their true home, the heavenly Jerusalem, by the help of the sacraments and sacrifice of the Church. And they that neglect this, must not look for the kind showers of divine grace to give fruitfulness to their souls. Ch.—Out of the Church there is no salvation. C.—Other things may be obtained. S. Cyp. H.—The converts shall celebrate the Christian festivals, and merit great rewards, while infidels shall remain barren and devoid of eternal happiness. W.—We have no solemnity of tabernacles; but Gentiles keep the Epiphany in thanksgiving for their vocation to God’s *admirable light.* 1 Pet 2:9. C.  
**17** *There.* Sept. “these shall also be added to them” who perish. H.  
**19** *Sin*, or punishment. Formerly various nations were excluded from the religion or assemblies of Israel. Lev. 22:25. Deut. 23:1. Now all are invited and compelled to enter the Church, so that they can have no excuse. Lu. 14:24. C.—Those rejected by the Jews might still have true faith. H.  
**20** *Bridle.* The golden ornaments of the bridle, &c. shall be turned into offerings in the house of God. And there shall be an abundance of cauldrons and phials for the sacrifices of the temple; by which is meant, under a figure, the great resort there shall be to the temple, that is, to the Church of Christ, and her sacrifice. Ch.—It is of a different nature, being the body and blood of Christ. But it shall not be confined to one place, nor the priesthood to one family. v. 21. Heb. “they shall inscribe on the stables, Holy,” &c. The most filthy places shall be purified and changed into temples; or, “what is upon the little bells for horses shall be sanctified;” or, on these “bells shall be inscribed, sacred to the Lord.” C.—Metsilloth may signify a bell or bridle, &c. H.—The bits were often of gold. Æn. vii. and viii. C.—S. Jerom’s master said the word should be motsiluth, “trappings” and armour. H.  
**21** *Merchant;* or, as some render it, *the Chanaanite shall be no more*, &c. that is, the profane and unbelievers shall have no title to be in the house of the Lord; or, there shall be no occasion for buyers or sellers of oxen, or sheep, or doves, in the house of God, such as Jesus Christ cast out of the temple. Ch. John 2:16.—All former distinction of Jew and Gentile shall cease in the Church. Past faults shall be forgotten. C.
