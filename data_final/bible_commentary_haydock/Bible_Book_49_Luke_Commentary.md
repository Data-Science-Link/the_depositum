# Luke Commentary

**S. Luke** was a physician, a native of Antioch, the metropolis of Syria, and well skilled in the Greek language, as his writings sufficiently evince. In some ancient MSS. he is called Lucius, and Lucanus. Some conjecture that he was at first a Gentile and a pagan, and was converted by the preaching of S. Paul, at Antioch; others, that he was originally a Jew, and one of the seventy-two disciples. SS. Hippolitus and Epiphanius say, that hearing from our Lord these words, *he that eateth not my flesh, and drinketh not my blood, is not worthy of me*, he withdrew, and quitted our Saviour, but returned to the faith at the preaching of S. Paul. But, to leave what is uncertain, S. Luke was the disciple, travelling companion, and fellow-labourer of S. Paul. Of him S. Paul is supposed to speak: (2 Cor. 8:18) *We have sent also with him* (Titus) *the brother, whose praise is in the gospel, through all churches:* and again, *Luke, the most dear physician, saluteth you:* (Coloss. 4) and, *only L* *uke is with me.* 2 Tim. 4. Some are of opinion that as often as S. Paul, in his Epistles, says *according to my gospel*, he speaks of the Gospel of S. Luke. This evangelist did not learn his gospel from S. Paul only, (who had never been with our Lord in the flesh) but from the other apostles also, as himself informs us in the beginning of his gospel, when he says, *according as they have delivered the* *m unto us; who, from the beginning, were eye-witnesses*, (αυτοπται) *and ministers of the word.* His *gospel*, therefore, he wrote as he heard it; but the *Acts of the Apostles*, from his own observations; and both, as some believe, about the same time in which his history of the Acts finishes, towards the year of Christ 63. But the received opinion now is, that S. Luke wrote his gospel in Achaia, in the year 53, ten years previously to his writing of the *Acts*, purposely to counteract the fabulous relations concerning Jesus Christ, which several persons had endeavoured to palm upon the world. It does not appear, as Calmet observes, that he had ever read the gospels of S. Matt. and S. Mark … He chiefly insists in his gospel, upon what relates to Christ’s priestly office; hence the ancients gave, of the four symbolical representations, mentioned in Ezechiel, that of the ox, or calf, to S. Luke, as an emblem of sacrifices. He lived 84 years in the state of celibacy, was crucified at Elœa, in Peloponnesus, near Achaia, and was buried in the church of the apostles, at Constantinople, to which city his remains were translated, together with those of S. Andrew and S. Timothy, in the year 357, by order of the emperor Constantius. When this church was repaired, by an order of Justinian, the masons found three wooden chests, in which the bodies of these saints were interred. Baronius mentions, that the head of S. Luke was brought by S. Gregory from Constantinople to Rome, in the year of Christ 586. S. Luke writes purer Greek than any of the other hagiographers; yet many Syriac words, and turns of expressions, occur in both his gospel and Acts of the Apostles; some also that imitate the genius of the Latin tongue. He cites Scripture according to the Septuagint, and not after the Hebrew text. S. Paul, in his Epistles, generally quotes the gospel in a manner the most conformable to S. Luke, as may be seen in the following instances; 1 Cor. 11:23 and 24 c. 15:5. The Marcionites would only receive the gospel of S. Luke, and from this they retrenched the first two chapters, with regard the birth of Jesus Christ, and only admitted ten of S. Paul’s Epistles, as Tertullian and S. Epiphanius have remarked. Marcion embraced the errors of Cerdon: to these he added others, the offspring of his own brain. He began to disseminate his novel opinions at Rome, about the year of Christ 144. He could not bring himself to believe how a spirit, such as the human soul, could be shut up in a body, be subject to ignorance, to weakness, to pain; nor in what manner, or for what end, the great and good Lord, the Creator of spirits, could have thus degraded them. Revelation, which teaches us the fall of the first man, did not appear to the Marcionites, to solve the difficulty, since the first man was composed of a spiritual soul and a terrestrial body; they, moreover, imagined that an all-good, an all-powerful God, ought to have prevented the fall of man. No wonder then, that they refused to adopt the first two chapters of S. Luke, which contain the miraculous births of Jesus and his precursor; as also sundry texts of the very scanty portions of holy Scriptures which their party chose to retain. But what does this shew? that *tradition*, in the first instance, must be admitted, to inform us what is authentic scripture; and, secondly, an *infallible Church-authority*, to inform us what is the genuine interpretation of the genuine text. Without the assistance of apostolical tradition and Church-authority, could any Seeker (even with the assistance of Brown’s *Self-interpreting Bible*, in 2 vols. 4to.) rest secure, that he properly understood the disputed points of holy writ; that his, and no other interpretation, was the genuine sense of these mysterious words, when he was informed that by far the greater part of learned societies, and learned individuals, gave a widely different interpretation to the same texts. This freedom of expounding Scripture, by unassisted reason and private spirit, was the first germ of the daily increasing spread of sects and heresies; this is the nucleus, which, after enveloping itself like the comet, in much nebulous obscurity, terminates in a fiery tail, of portentous magnitude, the ruinous effects of which can only be prevented by a speedy return to first principles, *apostolical tradition, and Church-authority.*

## Chapter 1

**1** *That have been accomplished.* [1] In the Prot. translation, *of things most surely believed.* They have followed Beza, and Erasmus: but other learned critics have shewn that the same Greek word often signifies to fulfil; and it is clearly proved by S. Chrysostom.  
**3** *Having diligently obtained.* Here we see, that although the Holy Ghost regulated the pen of the holy writers, that they might not err; they still employed human means to search and find out the truth of things they mentioned. Even so do general councils, and the president thereof, the holy pontiff, discuss and examine all causes by human means, although they have the promise from Jesus Christ of the aid, assistance, and direction of his holy Spirit; (S. John 16:13,) as is manifest from the very first council of the apostles, held at Jerusalem. Acts 15:7 and 28.—*Most excellent Theophilus.* This word, *Theophilus*, by its etymology, signifies a *lover of God:* but here we may rather understand some particular person, by the title given him of *most excellent*, or *best:* which, at that time, was given to persons in dignity; as to to Felix, Acts 23:26 and to Festus, Acts 26:25. Wi.—Κρατιστε, may signify most powerful from Κρατος, strength, or Κρατειν, to conquer; or, as most generally given, from Κρειττων.—Θεοφιλος, may be interpreted either a lover of God, or one beloved of God. Whoever, therefore, loves God, and desires to be beloved by Him, should consider this gospel as penned for himself, and should preserve it as a pledge deposited in his hands. Ven. Bede.  
**5** The Almighty appointed to Moses, that there should be but one high priest at a time, to whom, at his decease, a successor should be chosen. This rule obtained till the time of David, by whom, by the inspiration of God, many were appointed at once. 1 Paralip. c. 24. According to this regulation, Zachary is said to perform the office of priest, according to the order of his course. Ven. Bede.—Zachary seems here to be described as high priest, who once a year entered alone in the inward sanctuary with the blood of the victims, which he offered for himself and the sins of the people. S. Ambrose.—He was not chosen by a fresh lot to offer up incense, but by a previous lot, according to which the family of Abia succeeded to the office of high priest. The people waited without, according to Levit. 16:12.; whilst the high priest carried the incense into the holy of holies, on the 10th day of the 7th month. Ven. Bede.—*Of the course of Abia.* [2] What we read in the Greek for *course*, is commonly put for the employment of *one day*, but here for the functions of a *whole week.* For by appointment of David, (1 Paral. 24,) the descendants from Aaron were divided into 24 families; of which the eighth was Abia, from whom descended this Zachary, who at this time was in the week of his priestly functions. Wi.—It is worthy of remark, that there were three Herods. The first was the one here spoken of, (surnamed Ascalonite, from his palace in the city of Ascalon, in Palestine) the same who murdered the Innocents. The second was the son of the first, (surnamed Antipas) who derided Christ at the time of his passion, the same who beheaded the Baptist. The third was Herod Agrippa, who beheaded S. James, imprisoned S. Peter, and who was afterwards, for his great pride, stricken by an angel, and devoured by worms. Our Saviour was born in the reign of the first Herod, by whom the prophecy of Jacob, related in the book of Genesis (c. 49,) was fulfilled: *The septre shall not be taken*, &c. Herod was an Idumæan, and made king of the Jews by the Romans. The Jews, after they entered the land of promise, were first governed by judges, until Saul: then by kings, until the Babylonian captivity; after that by high priests, until the time of Hyrcanus, whom Herod having killed, succeeded. From that period to the present day, they have been governed by strangers. Ven. Bede, and D. Dion. Carth.—Elizabeth was of the race of Aaron, by her father; but her mother was probably of the race of David, from whom the blessed Virgin, cousin of Elizabeth, descended. See infra, v. 36.  
**6** *Both just, … walking … without blame.* [3] Not that in the sight of God they were exempt even from all lesser feelings, which are called *venial* faults; but only from such sins as might make them forfeit the grace and favour of God. Wi.—Three things are here to be noticed: 1. that good men do keep all God’s commandments, which some moderns declare to be impossible; 2. that men are justified not by imputation only of Christ’s justice, nor by faith alone, but by walking in the commandments; 3. that keeping and doing the commandments, is properly our justification through Jesus Christ. The Greek word δικαιωματα, is properly rendered by Catholics, *justificati* *ons* or commandments, because the keeping of them through Jesus Christ, is justification. But our separated brethren purposely avoid this word against the justification of the Catholics, as one of their leaders in innovation blushes not to advance. Hence Beza, in his annotations on the New Test. ann. 1556, uses the word constituta, which his scholars render into English by *ordinances.* B.  
**9** *It* *was his lot.* The priests drew lots for the different functions to be performed in the same week; and now it fell by lot to Zachary, to burn or offer up incense, morning and evening, in that part of the temple called the *holy*, where was the altar of incense: Zachary was in this part of the tabernacle. Wi.—See Exod. 30:6, 8.  
**10** *And all the … people were praying without:* i.e. in that part of the temple called the *court of the Israelites.* For the Jews themselves were not permitted to enter into the first part of the tabernacle, called the *holy*, much less into the second part of it, called the *holy of holies;* the people then prayed, and performed their private devotions, in that division of the temple called the court of the Israelites, and were there waiting for the coming out of the priest Zachary. Wi.—We here see that the priest’s functions profited the people, though they neither heard nor saw the priest, but only joined in intention with him; and so may the prayers of the priest in the Catholic Church, though offered up in an unknown tongue.  
**12** The cause of this fear, was the general sentiment that obtained with the Jews, that they would die immediately on seeing an angel. V.  
**13** *Thy prayer is heard.* We cannot suppose, as S. Aug. observes, (l. ii. QQ. Evang. c i, tom. 3, part 2, p. 249. Ed. Ben.) that he was praying to have children, when his wife was so advanced in years; *that* he did not think possible; but he was praying for the people, and for the coming of the Messias. See S. Chrys. hom. ii. de incomprehensibili, tom. 1, p. 454. Nov. Ed. Ben. Wi.—Zachary so far despaired of having any offspring, that he did not believe the angel, when he made him the promise. When therefore the angel says, *thy prayer is heard*, we must understand it of the prayer he offered in behalf of the people, to whom salvation and remission of sins were to be brought by Christ. The angel, moreover, told him of the birth of his son, who was to be the precursor of Christ. S. Austin.—The son that is to be born of thee, will shew that thy prayer is heard, when he cries out, *behold the Lamb of God.* S. Chrysos.—It is always a mark of singular merit, whenever the Almighty either appoints or changes the name of a man. Ven. Bede.—The name of *John* is derived from the Hebrew word, Jochanan, which frequently occurs in the Old Testament, as 1 Par. 3:15 and 6:9. and 12:12. &c. and signifies, *blessed with grace or divine favour;* see also in Isai. 30:18, 19.  
**14** This was fulfilled not only at his birth, but ever after by the Catholic Church, celebrating his nativity. A.  
**15** **V** **er.** **15** **.** After the angel had assured him of the joy this son should bring to many, he acquaints him of the excellency of his virtue. *He shall be great before the Lord.* He did not extend the boundaries of empire; he did not obtain the triumphs of war, and force captive and degraded kings to pay him homage: but, what is much greater, preaching in a desert, he renounced the pleasures of the world, and with the greatest fortitude repressed and subdued the concupiscence of the flesh. Therefore it is said, he *shall drink no wine, nor strong drink.* S. Ambrose.—*And shall drink no wine, nor strong drink* *:* [4] lit. *sicera*, by which is signified any liquor that is apt to make a man drunk, according to S. Jerom. Wi.—This prohibition of the angel was a part of the consecration of the Nazarites. See Numb. 6:3. The word *sicera* properly signifies wine of the palm-tree; and next to wine of the grape, there was no more common liquor, none more intoxicating. V.—*And he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, ev* *en from his mother’s womb;* from which words some conjecture, that S. John the Baptist, though conceived in original sin, yet might have been freed from the guilt of it before he came into the world. Of this see S. Aug. Ep. lvii. now Ep. clxxxvii. ad Dardanum. t. ii, p. 685. Ed. Ben. Wi.  
**17** *Turn the hearts of the fathers*, &c. The angel applies these words (Malach. 4:6) to S. John the Baptist; telling his father, that he shall convert *many of the children of Israel*, &c. by bringing them to the knowledge of Christ. Secondly, that *he shall go before him*, or be his precursor and forerunner.—*I* *n the spirit and power of Elias;* i.e. S. John shall be the forerunner of Christ’s first coming to redeem mankind, as Elias shall be the forerunner of Christ’s second coming to judge the world. Thirdly, that S. John, by converting the Jews, shall also *turn the hearts of the fathers to the children*, &c. The meaning of which obscure words seems to be, that whereas Moses, Abraham, and the prophets, (whose souls were in a place of rest) knew by a revelation from God, that their children, the Jews, lived in sin and disobedience to the laws of God; and on this account were offended and displeased at them: now when they shall know that they have been converted by the preaching of S. John, they shall rejoice, and be reconciled to their children, the Jews: for as our Saviour tells us, (Luke 15:7) *th* *ere is joy in heaven upon any one sinner that doth penance.* The angel, to explain the foregoing words, adds, *and the incredulous to the wisdom and prudence of the just;* i.e. S. John’s preaching shall make them truly wise and just. Wi.—With reason is he said to precede Christ, who was his forerunner both in his birth and in his death. In the spirit of prophecy, and in the power of abstinence, and patience, and zeal, they resembled each other; Elias was in the desert, S. John was in the desert also. The one sought not the favour of king Achab, the other despised the favour of Herod. The one divided the Jordan, the other changed it into a laver of salvation. The one is to be the forerunner of Jesus Christ’s second coming, as the other was of his first. S. Ambrose.  
**18** *Whereby shall I kno* *w this?* Zachary could not question the Divine Power, but he doubted of what the angel told him. Wi.—It was customary with the Jews, when they heard that any wonderful event was to take place, to inquire whether the Almighty had manifested his will by any supernatural sign. Zachary puts this question to the angel, not through any doubt concerning the omnipotence of God, but because what was promised could not be compassed in the natural order of things: for, *I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.* D. Diony.  
**19** The name *Gabriel* signifies, the strength of God; or, God is my strength. The angels are sometimes styled by proper names, in order to shew their respective duties; thus, no angel could better be appointed to declare the precursor, as also the Messias himself, than he who was styled *the power of God:* since he came to declare the coming of one who was to destroy the power of the devil, and overthrow his kingdom. Nic. de Lyra. See Tob. 12:15. Apoc. 1:4 and 8:2.  
**20** **0** **.** On account of the many signs the angel had given, that what he said was true, the unbelief of Zachary seemed inexcusable; for the angel appeared in a holy place, in the temple, and during divine service: he, moreover, foretold what related to the redemption of all the people, and to the glory of God; from all which circumstances, Zachary ought to have concluded, that it was a good angel, and that what he said would eventually come to pass. Nic. de Lyra.—*Shalt be dumb*, &c. He seems to have been both dumb and deaf by the Greek text, and by what we may learn from v. 62; where we find, that those who were present did not speak, but rather made *signs to him.* Wi.  
**23** *After the days of his office were accomplished;* i.e. the weekly ministry; for during that time, the priests lodged in buildings joining to the temple, separated from their wives. Wi.—When it fell to the lot of any of the priests to offer incense, they not only separated from their wives, but left their houses; wherefore it is said, *as soon as the day*, &c. As it was ordained that the priesthood should continue in the family of Aaron, it was necessary they should have wives. But, as we do not now so much seek after priests of the same family, as those who are virtuous, it has been decreed, that priests should observe perpetual continency, that they may be able to assist at all times at the altar. Ven. Bede.—For the law of perpetual celibacy of the clergy, See S. Jerom, l. i. c. ix. 19. advers Jovin. et. ep. 50; also S. Ambrose, in 1 Tim. iii.  
**27** The word Miriam, or Mary, is expounded by S. Jerom from different etymologies, to signify in Hebrew, *star of the sea*, and in Chaldaic, *lady.* Both interpretations admirably well agree with her, who is the glorious Queen of heaven, our patroness and star, to direct us in the stormy ocean of this world.—“O you,” cries out S. Bernard, “who find yourselves tossed to and fro in this tempestuous life, turn not your eyes away from the brightness of this star, if you would not be overwhelmed in these storms. If the winds of temptations arise; if you fall among the rocks of tribulation; look up to the star, call upon Mary. If you are agitated, and hard driven with the surges of pride, ambition, detraction, jealousy, or envy; look up to the star, call upon Mary. If anger, covetousness, or lust, beat furiously on the vessel of your soul; look up to the star, call upon Mary. If you are beginning to founder, and are just sinking into the gulph of melancholy and despair; think on Mary. In dangers, in distresses, in perplexities, think on Mary, call on Mary. Let her name be never absent from your mouth; from your mouth let it constantly descend into your heart; and, that you may obtain the suffrage of her prayers; both in life and death, never depart from the example of her pious conversation.” S. Bernard, hom. ii. super Missus est.  
**28** *Hail, full of grace:* [5] by the greatest share of divine graces granted to any creature. This translation, approved by the ancient Fathers, agrees with the ancient Syriac and Arabic versions. There was no need therefore to change it into *gracious*, with Erasmus; into *freely beloved*, with Beza; into *highly favoure* *d*, with the Prot. translators. For if seven deacons (Acts 6:3) are said to be *full of the Holy Ghost*, as it is again said of S. Stephen, (Acts 7:55) and also of the same S. Stephen, (Acts 6 v. 8) that he *was full of grace*, (as the learned Dr. Wells translates it in his amendments made to the Prot. translation) why should any one be offended at this salutation given to the blessed mother of God; who would not have been raised to this highest dignity, had not her soul been first prepared for it by the greatest share of divine graces?—*The Lord is with thee*, by his interior graces; and now, at this moment, is about to confer upon thee the highest of all dignities, by making thee truly the mother of God. Wi.—The Catholic Church makes frequent use of these words which were brought by the archangel from heaven, as well to honour Jesus Christ and his virgin Mother, as because they were the first glad tidings of Christ’s incarnation, and man’s salvation; and are the very abridgment and sum of the whole gospel. In the Greek Church, they are used daily in the Mass. See the Liturgy of S. James, and that of S. Chrysos.  
**29** *When she had heard.* In the Greek text, when she had *seen;* as if she also saw the angel, as S. Ambrose observed. Wi.  
**31** It may perhaps in the first instance of reflection, appear shocking to our ideas, that a God should dwell in a human body; but does not the sun emit its rays into all kinds of places, without any detriment to its purity? How much more would the Sun of justice, assuming a most pure body, formed of the purest blood of the spotless Virgin, not only remain free from every the least stain himself, but even impart additional sanctity to his virgin Mother. S. Thos. Aquinas.  
**32** *He … shall be called;* i.e. according to the style of the Scriptures, he shall truly be the Son of God. Wi.  
**33** Those are here called of the house of Jacob, who out of the multitude of the Jews believed in Christ. This is conformable to that text of S. Paul: *All are not Israelites that are of Israel, but the children of the promise are accounted for the seed.* Rom. 9:6, 8. S. Chrysos. hom. vii. on S. Matt.—*And of his kingdom there shall be no end:* which clearly shews it was not to be a temporal, but a spiritual and an eternal kingdom. Wi.  
**34** *How shall this be done?* She only asks about the manner.—*Because I know not man.* [6] This answer, as S. Aug. takes notice, would have been to no purpose, had she not made a vow to God to live always a virgin. Wi.—Listen to the words of this pure Virgin. The angel tells her she shall conceive; but she insists upon her virginity, holding her purity in higher estimation than the promised dignity. S. Greg. of Nyssa.—She did not doubt the truth of what the angel said, (as Calvin impiously maintained) but she wished it might not happen to the prejudice of her vowed virginity. Ambrose, Austin, Bede, Theophylactus, &c. &c.  
**35** *The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee*, &c. By the divine power thou shalt bring forth, and yet remain always a pure virgin.—*And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee, shall be called* (shall be) *the Son of God.* The second person of the ever blessed Trinity, being united to our human nature, remaining unchangeably the same God, and being born of the Virgin Mary; it must needs be true to say that God was born, that God suffered and died for us; and consequently that the blessed Virgin Mary was truly the mother of God, or of him that is truly God; though not the mother of the Godhead: as the Catholic Church declared in the council of Ephesus, (431) against the heretic Nestorius. Wi.—Seek not for natural order in things that transcend nature. You ask, *how shall this be done, since you know not man?* This, your ignorance of man, is the very reason why this will take place within you. For had you not been pure, you never would have been deemed worthy of so great a mystery. Not because marriage is bad, but because virginity is far more excellent. The common Lord of all ought in his birth to have something common with all mankind, and still something different. He was conceived and born in the womb like the rest of mankind, but he differed from them in being born of a virgin. S. Chry. xlix. in Genes.  
**36** We find that Aaron, who was of the tribe of Levi, took a wife of the tribe of Juda, viz. Elizabeth, the sister of Naasson. In the successors of David we find that Joiada, the chief priest, took a wife of the family of David, viz. the daughter of Joram; from which it appears that both the royal and sacerdotal tribes were united, and that Mary and Elizabeth were relatives. It was certainly proper that Christ should be born of both these tribes, because he was in himself both king and priest. Ven. Bede.  
**38** *Behold the handmaid.* With all modesty and humility of heart and mind, the blessed Virgin consented to the divine will: and from that moment in her was conceived the Saviour and Redeemer of the world. Wi.—Thus ought the virgin, who brought forth meekness and humility itself, to shew forth an example of the most profound humility. S. Amb.  
**39** This city is generally supposed to be Hebron, a sacerdotal town, (Jos. 21:11) situated in the mountains, to the south of Juda, and about 120 miles from Nazareth. V.  
**41** *The infant leaped in her womb.* [7] According to the general opinion of the interpreters, this motion of the child at the time was not natural: and some think that God gave to S. John, even in his mother’s womb, a passing knowledge of the presence of his Redeemer. See S. Aug. in the above cited letter to Dardanus. Wi.  
**42** In the same words she is pronounced blessed by Elizabeth, and by the angel Gabriel, both inspired by the Holy Ghost, and this not only to the praise of Jesus, but for his sake, to the praise of Mary, calling her blessed, and her fruit blessed; and thus, as Ven. Bede asserts, holding her up to the veneration of both men and angels.  
**43** *The mother of my Lord.* A proof that Christ was truly God, and the blessed Virgin Mary truly the mother of God. Wi.—Elizabeth was a just and blessed woman; yet the excellency of the mother of God does so far surpass that of Elizabeth, and of every other woman, as the great luminary outshines the smaller stars. S. Jerom præf. in Sophon.  
**47** *In God my Saviour*, as appears by the Greek text, [8] though literally in Latin, *in God my* *salvation.* Wi.  
**48** *The humility of his handmaid*, [9] i.e. the humble, low, and abject condition; as perhaps might be translated both in this and in v. 52. For the blessed Virgin does not here commend and praise her own virtue of humility; as divers interpreters observe. See S. Francis of Sales, in his introduction to a devout life, part 3, c. vi. Wi.—As death entered into the world by the pride of our first parents, so was it proper that the path to life should be opened by the humility of Mary. Ven. Bede.—Not Elizabeth only, but all nations of believers are to call her blessed. Theophy.  
**51** **V** **er.** **51** **.** The wise men of the Gentiles, the Pharisees and Scribes, were powerful; but these the Almighty cast down, and exalted those, *who humbled themselves under his powerful hand.* 1 Peter 5. The Jews were proud in their strength, but their incredulity brought on them their humiliation; whilst the low and mean among the Gentiles, have by faith ascended to the summit of perfection. S. Cyril Alex. in S. Thom. catenâ aureâ. Wi.  
**53** The Jews were rich in the possession of the law, and the doctrines of the prophets; but, as they would not humbly unite themselves to the incarnate word, they were sent away empty, without faith, without knowledge, deprived of all hopes of temporal goods, excluded from the terrestrial Jerusalem, and also from that which is in heaven. But the Gentiles, oppressed with hunger and thirst, by adhering to their Lord, were filled with all spiritual gifts. S. Basil in Ps. xxxiii.  
**63** As then in circumcision, so now in baptism, names are given. And as we see here, and is all the Old Testament, great respect was had of names, so must we be aware of profane and secular names, and rather, according to the *catechism of the council of Trent*, take names of saints and holy persons, which may put us in mind of their virtues. De Bap. in fine.  
**69** As Christ was born of the race of David, he is here called the horn of salvation in the house of David. As Isaias says, *a vineyard is planted in the horn*, c. 5.—*A powerful salvation.* [10] According to the letter both of the Latin and Greek text, *a horn of salvation.* But as it is generally agreed, that by *horn*, in the phraseology of the Scriptures, is understood strength and *power*, and that *horn* sounds awkwardly in English, and other languages, I hope it may be literally enough translated, *a powerful salvati* *on.* Wi.  
**71** *That he would save us*, &c. Lit. *salvation from our enemies.* The construction and sense is, that God, as he had declared by his prophets, would grant us salvation, or would save us. Wi.—This is not to be understood of temporal, but of spiritual enemies. For the Lord Jesus, strong in battle, came to destroy all our enemies, and thus to deliver us from their snares and temptations. Origen, hom. xvi.—*He is that King of Glory, the Lord strong and powerful, the Lord powerful in battle.* Ps. 23.  
**72** *To remember his holy covenant*, i.e. of his promise, or of the covenant made with Abraham, that he would bless all nations in his seed. Wi.—At the coming of Christ, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were made partakers of his mercy. For, we cannot suppose that they who saw his day, and were glad, should not participate in the fruit of his coming; since S. Paul says: *he maketh peace through the blood of the cross, both to the things that are on earth, and the things that are in heaven.* Col. 1:20. Origen, hom. x.  
**73** **Ver.** **73–4** **.** According to *the oath which he swore.* [11] The words *according to*, are no addition to the letter of the text: they only barely express what is here signified; to wit, that God swore to Abraham, that he would *grant us*, or make it come to pass, that *being delivered from our enemies*, sin and the devil, *we should* be in a condition *to serve him without fear, in holin* *ess*, &c. Wi.  
**75** It is possible, we here see, to have true justice, not only in the sight of man, or by the imputation of God, but in his sight; and the coming of Christ was to give men such justice.  
**77** Jesus is our salvation, and S. John was sent to give to the people the knowledge of this salvation: he bore testimony of Christ; (Theophy.) by whom alone remission of sins can be obtained.  
**78** The *rising* light, [12] or the rising sun, *hath visited us* from on high. The Rheims translation hath the *Orient*, the Prot. the *day-spring.* Both seem more obscure than they need be. The Latin, as well as the Greek, hath a noun substantive, by which Christ himself is signified. Yet the same word, in both languages, is sometimes taken for *a rising light*, and sometimes for a *bud*, or branch; in which latter sense it is expounded by S. Jerom. Comment in Zachar. p. 1737, tom. 3, Ed. Ben. But in this place it is rather taken for a light that riseth, by the following words, *to enlighten them* *that sit in darkness*, &c. Wi.—*The Orient.* It is one of the titles of the Messias, the true light of the world, and the sun of justice. Ch.—By this he shews that God has forgiven us our sins, not through our merits, but through his own most tender mercy; (Theophy.) and that we are to solicit this forgiveness through the bowels of his most tender mercy.  
**79** The Gentiles were in darkness, and given to the adoration of idols, till the light arose and dispelled the darkness, spreading on all sides the splendour of truth. S. Basil on Isai.—With reason it is said in this place, *who sit in darkne* *ss;* for we did not walk in darkness, but sat down, as if destitute of all hopes of being delivered. S. Chrys. hom. xiv. on S. Matt.… Then our steps are directed in the paths of peace, when in our every action we act conformably to the grace of the Almighty. S. Greg. hom. xxxii.  
**80** S. John remained in the desert till the 30th year of his age. The reason why he concealed himself so long was because he feared the cruelty of Herod; for, though he was not under his jurisdiction, not being on the confines of Bethlehem, yet on account of the remarkable events that took place at his birth, by which he was declared the precursor of the Messias, he had reason to dread the cruelty of the jealous and suspicious Herod. Peter of Alexandria, Nicephorus, Baronius, and others, say, that when he was yet in his mother’s arms, he was conveyed into the desert, and there concealed in the caves and fissures of the rocks, where people concealed themselves on the approach of their enemies. Cedrinus adds, that 40 days after their flight, the mother of S. John died; after which, an angel is said to have undertaken the care of the Baptist; but most probably this office was performed by some attendant on S. Elizabeth. Tirinus.—The Baptist remained in the desert till he began his public ministry, which by a law of the Jews could not be much before he had attained his 30th years. He is styled by antiquity the first hermit. See S. Jerom in Vita Pauli.

## Chapter 2

**1** By the *whole world*, is understood the Roman empire. Wi.—This decree was promulgated in the 752d year of Rome, in the 3970th year of the world, and the 42d year of the reign of Augustus, when there was universal peace, and the temple of Janus remained shut for 12 years. Jans. concord. Evan.—It was the custom among the Jews to be numbered according to their tribes and families. Hence arose the necessity of the journey of the Holy Family to Nazareth. This enrolment probably included the number, as well as the property of each family, that the taxes might be proportioned. Idem. ibid.  
**2** *By Cyrinus*, or Publius Sulp. Quirinus. Wi.—This was the first census made by Quirinus, governor of Syria: nine years after the birth of Christ, this same Quirinus was charged to make a second, when Judea was reduced to a Roman province, by the deposition and exile of Archelaus.  
**3** *Into his own city*, i.e. the city of every one’s family. Now Joseph and Mary, being both of the *family o* *f David*, were obliged to go to Bethlehem, the city of David, where by Providence, according to the predictions of the prophets, the Messias was to be born. Wi.—This decree took place by a special providence of the Almighty, that every one might be compelled to go to his own country; and that thereby the Saviour of Israel might more easily escape the snares of the treacherous Herod. Ven. Bede.—This circumstance, moreover, was a public testimony, to be kept in the archives of the country, of the birth and descent of the Messias. Augustus only meant to enumerate his subjects, but among them was numbered his God.  
**4** The evangelist here mentions the city of David, to remind us how exactly that was fulfilled, which God promised to David, that an everlasting king should be born of him: and the reason why the inspired writer was content to mention the relationship between Joseph and David, omitting that of the Blessed Virgin and the royal prophet, was, because in the law it was commanded that persons of the same family should intermarry; hence it is added in the subsequent verse, *with Mary, his espoused wife.* S. Irenæus hær. l. iii. c. 11.  
**7** *In a manger* within a stable, or place where beasts were sheltered. And it is the common opinion that an ox and an ass were there at that time. See Baronius, Tillemont, &c. Wi.—O wonderful mystery! O astonishing condescension of a God-man! From his birth he takes upon himself poverty. Had such been his pleasure, Christ might, at his birth, have shaken the heavens by his power, and terrified all nature by his majesty. But these were not the attendants of his coming; for he came not to destroy, but to save; not to display riches, but to teach us a contempt of human grandeur. He therefore condescended not only to become man, but even *the vilest of men.* Metaphrastes.  
**11** Because the light of life is risen to us, dwelling in the region of the shadow of death. Ven. Bede.  
**12** On the eastern side of the town of Bethlehem, say S. Justin, S. Jerom, &c. there was a cave cut in the side of a rock, in which was a manger used by the people of those environs; so that these shepherds easily understood the angel, who told them they should find him laid in a manger. SS. Jer. Greg. Naz. Cyril, say that they found the child between an ox and an ass, according to the version of the Septuagint. Habac. 3:2.: *You shall find him laid* *between two beasts.* In the place where this crib was, S. Helen built a magnificent church in honour of the blessed Virgin Mary. Ven. Bede says that she built another in honour of the tree shepherds; whence S. Bernard concludes, that there were only three shepherds that came to adore the divine infant in the manger. Tirinus.—It might be necessary to give them notice of this humble appearance of the Messias, to encourage them to go and pay him their homage. Barradius.  
**14** *And on earth, peace to men of good will.* [1] I had translated, *peace to men of his good will*, looking upon the sense to be, that a peace and reconciliation were offered, and given to men from the good will and mercy of God. The ordinary Greek copies altogether favour this exposition. And Bellarmine (l. ii, de Verb. D. c. 11.) is so convinced of this sense, that he brings it for an instance of one of those places, in which the true sense of the Latin is to be found by the Greek text; which is many times true: but Bellarmine might not take notice, that several of the best Greek MSS. are conformable to the Latin Vulgate, and have *peace to men of good will;* as it is also expounded by divers of the ancient Fathers, that peace is offered to men of good will, to those who by the grace of God are disposed to believe and obey the Gospel-doctrine. And upon this, having advised with others, I did not think fit to change the former Rheimish translation. Wi.—The reason why the will is designated in preference to any other power of the soul, is, because the will moves the rest; consequently the goodness or badness of an action depends chiefly on the will. By this also the angels wished to shew, that the peace which Christ came to bring into the world, was the internal peace of our souls, of which the external peace that subsisted under Augustus, was a figure. Nic. de Lyra.—Peace is made on earth, since human nature, before an enemy of God, is now reconciled and united to him by his incarnation. Theophy.—In this hymn of the angels there is a remarkable difference observable in some of the Greek and Latin copies. The latter have it according to this text, *men of good will;* the former, *good will among men, o* *r to men.* Ευδοκια, signifies the gratuitous benevolence of God towards man. So that this sentence seems divided into three parts: glory to God, peace on earth, and good will to men. Jans. conc. Evang.—The birth of Christ giveth not peace of mind, or salvation, but to such as are of good will, because he worketh not our good against our wills, but with the concurrence of our will. S. Aug. quæst. ad Simplic. l. 1. q. 2. t. 4.  
**15** The word which always was, let us see how it is made for us; that which we could not see, when it was the word, let us see because it is made flesh. V. Bede.—See how particularly the Scripture weighs the meaning of every word. The shepherds hastened to see the word, for when the flesh of the Lord is seen, the word is seen, which is the Son. S. Amb.  
**17** They saw this with the eyes of their body, but with their internal eyes they discovered other wonders, viz. that he, who lay there in such great poverty, was their Messias, their great King, and the Son of God. Barradius.  
**19** Mary kept all these things, and compared what was accomplished in her, concerning the Lord, with what had been written of him by the prophets. V. Bede.—She considered in her heart the arguments of faith. S. Ambrose.  
**21** *Should be circumcised;* which might be done not only in the temple, or in a synagogue, but in any house. Wi.—Many reasons may be alleged why our Saviour submitted to the painful and humbling knife of circumcision: 1. to manifest to the whole world the reality of his human nature, and the difference between his divinity and humanity; 2. to shew he approved of circumcision, which he had instituted; 3. to prove that he was of the seed of Abraham; 4. to teach us humility and obedience, by observing a law to which he was not bound; 5. that by receiving the burthen of the law, he might free those that were under the law, (Gal. 3); and lastly, that the Jews might have no excuse for rejecting him, because he was uncircumcised. S. Epiph. and Nic. de Lyra.  
**22** *Of her purification.* The blessed Virgin mother stood not in need of this ceremony, to which she submitted herself, as her Son did to that of *circumcision.* Wi.—Whence S. Laur. Justin. in his sermon on the purification, very well observes: grace raised the Virgin above the law; humility subjected her to it. Jesus Christ, in subjecting himself to the law of Moses, has left an example to princes and magistrates, to obey their own laws; for then they may expect them to be observed by others, when themselves shew respect to them. Barradius.  
**23** *Every male opening the womb.* [2] This translation is more conformable to the doctrine of the Fathers, that Christ was born without opening the womb; which Bede calls the doctrine of the Catholic Church. Wi.—See Exod. 13:2 and Num. 8:16.  
**24** This was the offering of the poorer classes.  
**25** *A man … named Simeon*, whom some conjecture to have been one of the Jewish priests.—*Waiting for the consolation of Israel*, for the happy coming of the Messias.—*And the Holy Ghost was in him*, by the spirit of grace and of prophecy. Wi.—The consolation here expected by Holy Simeon, was the coming of the Messias, and the consequent redemption of mankind from sin and the devil; not a redemption only, as some carnal Jews thought, from the power of temporal enemies. These supposed the Messias was to come in order to raise them in power above all nations, to whom before his coming they had been subject. S. Greg. of Nyssa in Diony.—Many have pretended that Simeon was a priest; the best and oldest interpreters say he was a laic. V.  
**26** **V** **er.** **26** **.** *And he had received an answer, … that he should not see death;* i.e. die. Wi.  
**27** *And he came by the spirit*, or moved by the holy Spirit. Wi.  
**30** *Thy salvation;* i.e. the Saviour, whom thou hast sent. Wi.  
**31** *Before the face of all people;* not of Israel only, but also as a *light* to be revealed to the Gentiles, the spiritual children of Abraham: to whom also the promises were made. Wi.  
**33** In the Greek, *Joseph and the mother of Jesus.* V.  
**34** *Is set for the ruin.* Christ came for the redemption and salvation of all men: but Simeon prophesies what would happen in consequence of the wilful blindness and obstinacy of *many.* Wi.—Not that God sent his Son for the fall of any man; but that many, by their own perverseness, in wilfully refusing to receive and obey him, would take occasion of falling. Ch.—*And for a sign which shall be contradicted*, to signify that Christ, and his doctrine, should be as it were *a mark*, or *butt*, against whom the Jews should discharge the arrows and darts of their malice. Wi.—Hence S. Paul, (2 Cor. 2:16) *We are to one the odour of death unto death, but to the other the odour of life unto life.*  
**35** *And thy own soul a sword shall* *pierce.* These words, which figuratively express the grief of the blessed Virgin mother, when present at the death of her Son, are to be taken by way of a parenthesis.—*That out of many hearts thoughts* *may be revealed*, and these are to be joined with what went before; to wit, that child shall be a *sign of contradiction, set unto the fall and resurrection of many, that the thoughts of many hearts* may be revealed and disclosed; when some shall believe, and others remain in their obstinacy. Wi.—Bede, and many others, understand this of the sharp sorrow, which wounded the soul of the blessed Virgin Mary, at the time of Christ’s passion. Barradius.—Carthusianus and Jansenius explain this passage as follows: Behold, this child is placed for a sign that shall be contradicted, which as a sword of most poignant grief will pierce thy soul, O Virgin! But Christ shall be contradicted, that the thoughts of the Jews may be revealed from many hearts, and it may appear who among them are good, and who are wicked and hypocrites. Barradius.  
**36** *Anna, a prophetess.* She was another witness that Jesus was the Messias, venerable for age, and more for her piety.—*And had lived with her husband seven ye* *ars from her virginity;* i.e. had been seven years a wife: and from the death of her husband, had remained always a widow: now 84 years of age: who *departed not from the temple*, but was constantly there at the times of prayer, with *fastings and prayers, serving God day and night.* Wi.  
**40** *The child grew, and waxed strong, full of wisdom*, and (52) *increased in wisdom and age.* The Arians from this, pretend to prove that Christ was not truly God, who cannot advance or increase in wisdom. The true meaning is, that Jesus, as he advanced in age as man, gave greater marks of his divine wisdom, and discovered himself full of knowledge, wisdom, &c. Wi.  
**41** How can we account for what is related in this verse, that his parents went up every year to Jerusalem, during the childhood of Jesus, when, as we are taught in other parts, his parents did not dare to fix their abode in Jerusalem, for fear of Archelaus: but this, says S. Austin, will not be very difficult to answer; for, it might be easier for them to ascend up to Jerusalem on these particular occasions, without being noticed in so numerous a crowd, and privately return; though it might not be prudent for them to fix their habitation there, lest they might be too much noticed: and, as no one has yet informed us how long Archelaus continued to reign, what S. Luke relates might have taken place after the death of that prince. S. Austin.  
**44** It may be asked how the blessed Virgin and S. Joseph could possibly have come so far without missing him; but we must take notice, that when the people went up to the temple from remote parts of Judea, the men went in one company, and the women in a separate company, whilst the children went in either company indifferently: so that S. Joseph imagined that he was with Mary, his mother, whilst she imagined he was with S. Joseph. Nic. de Lyra.  
**49** *I must be about the things that are my Father’s?* By these words he shewed, that not S. Joseph, but only God, was his father. Wi.  
**50** *They understood not*, &c. That is, knew not when, or by what means, Christ designed to make himself known to the world. Wi.  
**51** *Was subject to them.* Astonishing humility! which the Son of God was pleased to teach by his example, as also obedience to parents. Wi.—The evangelist relates nothing of our Saviour from the age of twelve till the age of thirty, except that he was subject to S. Joseph and the blessed Virgin. The divine Spirit shewing by this, that nothing is so great and amiable in Christians, as ready obedience to the directions of their superiors. Barradius.—All children are hereby taught what subjection and obedience is due from them to their parents.  
**52** Not that he was wiser at any future period of his life, than he was at the moment of his conception, but this is said, because he chose to manifest increasing signs of wisdom as he increased in years.—In the same manner also he increased in grace, by displaying, as he advanced in age, the gifts of grace with which he was endowed; and by this excited men to the praise of God, from the consideration of favours God had bestowed upon him; and thus he conduced to the honour of God, and the salvation of men. S. Greg.—The sun, always equally brilliant in itself, is said to increase in splendour, till it has reached its meridian brilliancy.

## Chapter 3

**1** *Pilate being governor of Judea*, lit. *procurator* *;* i.e. with a subordination to the president of Syria. Wi.—This was Herod Antipas, son of Herod the great, mentioned in C. 1, v. 5.  
**2** *Under the high priests, Annas and Caiphas.* There was properly but one high priest at a time; and Caiphas had this office and title all the ten years that Pilate governed Judea. See Joseph. l. xviii. Antiq. c. iii.—In these short notes I shall not pretend to examine the chronological difficulties, as to Christ’s birth, death, &c. Wi.  
**3** To all who read, it is plain, that S. John not only preached baptism, but likewise conferred it upon many; yet, he could not give baptism to the remission of sins. S. Greg. hom. xx.—When the victim was not yet immolated, how could they obtain remission of sins? How could S. Luke say, *preaching the baptism of penance, for the remission of sins?* The ignorant Jews not considering the greatness of their transgressions, S. John came exhorting them to acknowledge their sins, and do penance for them; that being converted, and truly contrite, they might seek after their Redeemer, and thus obtain remission of their offences. S. Chrys. hom. x. in Matt.—From these words originated an opinion, that the baptism of John remitted sins. Thus Prudentius, in his hymn on S. John:  
**5** *Every valley*, &c. If these words, in one sense, were a prediction of the deliverance of the Israelites from their captivity, (Isai. 40:3) and an admonition to level the roads for those that were to return, they also signified the redemption of mankind from the slavery of sin; and that all obstacles, which retarded this benefit, should be removed, and also that the proud should be depressed, and the humble receive graces. Wi.  
**6** This text is given according to the Sept.  
**7** This saint of the desert, seeing all the inhabitants of Palestine surrounding and admiring him, was not elated with the honour, but openly and severely rebuked them. S. Chrys. hom. xi on S. Matt.—According to S. Matt. the Baptist addressed these words principally to the Pharisees and Sadducees, there and then present.  
**8** It is one thing to bring forth fruits of penance, and another to bring forth *worthy fruits.* We should know that the man who has committed nothing unlawful, may have a right to use the lawful things of the world, and can perform works of piety, without forsaking innocent enjoyments, unless he pleases. But, if he has fallen into great crimes, let him abstain from what is lawful, as much as he has transgressed, by yielding to guilt. Nor is equal penance required of him who has sinned little, and of him who has fallen into many crimes. And let those, whose consciences convict them, labour to lay up a treasure of good works, proportioned to the injury they have done themselves by their sins. S. Greg. hom. xx. in Evang.—It is not sufficient for penitents to forsake their sins, they must also bring forth worthy fruits, according to that of the psalmist, *decline from evil, and do good.* Ps. 36. As it is not enough to extract the dart; and external application is also necessary. He says not *fruit*, but *fruits*, to shew the abundance of good works we ought to perform. S. Chrys. hom. x. on S. Matt.—He does not mean to say that they did not descend from Abraham, but that their descending from Abraham would avail them nothing, unless they kept up the succession of his virtues. S. Chrys. hom. xi. and xii on S. Matt.—What can those be thought but stones, who have given themselves to the adoration of stones; to which, says the psalmist, they are assimilated, who place their trust in them? By this the Baptist prophesies, that faith shall be infused into the stony hearts of the Gentiles, who by faith shall become the children of Abraham. S. Amb.—Consider, says S. Chrys. how S. John draws them from boasting of their pedigree, and trusting to their descent from Abraham, to place their hope of salvation in the practice of penance and a holy life. hom. xi. ibid.—A lesson this for Catholics, not to expect to find mercy at the last day, for being members of the true religion, unless they live up to the maxims which it prescribes. *If I should have all faith, so that I could move mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.* 1 Cor. 13:2.  
**9** By this example is meant that anger of God, which the Jews raised against themselves by their impiety towards their Messias. The axe is laid to the root of the tree, for the branches are already lopt off; but the tree was not rooted up, *for a remnant of Israel shall be saved.* S. Cyril. l. 3. on Isai. xl.  
**11** *He that hath two coats*, &c. S. John exhorts them to works of charity towards the poor, by giving what is superfluous. Wi.—Here we are taught that whatever we have more than our own wants require, must be bestowed on those who are in need; for the love of that God, of whom we have received all. S. Basil, in Avar.—Charity to the poor is frequently recommended in Scripture, as a powerful method of redeeming sin, and reconciling us to divine mercy. This was Daniel’s advice to king Nabuchodonosor: “May my counsel please thee, O king, and do thou redeem thy sins with alms and mercy to the poor.” Dan. 4. Hence S. Chrys. says: “The poor are physicians, and their hands are an ointment for your wounds.” hom. xiv. in ep. 1. ad Tim.—See the unbounded love of God; he offers us his mercy, provided we will relieve our indigent brethren! A.  
**12** The Baptist exhorts worldlings to abstain from every species of fraud, that by first restraining all desires of the goods of others, they may at length come to communicate some of their own to their neighbours. Ven. Bede.  
**13** *Do no* *thing more.* You who are military men, exact no more of the people than what is allowed and appointed you. Wi.  
**14** The Baptist knew that such as engage in war, are not murderers, but ministers of the law; not avengers of injuries, but defenders of the public weal. Had he thought otherwise, he would have said: “cast away your arms, abandon the service, never strike, maim, or destroy any one:” these are not the things which are blameable in the military, but their cruelty, their revenge, their implacable dispositions, and lust of power. S. Austin, l. 22. cont. Faust.  
**15** Many reasons might have induced the people to think that John was the Christ: 1. The wonders that took place at his birth and conception, his mother being very old, and without any prospect of offspring: 2. the excellence of his preaching, his mortified life, and the novelty of his baptism; and thirdly, the report which then generally prevailed among the Jews, that the Messias was already come; on account of the coming of the magi, and the murder of the infants by Herod: both which circumstances were probably fresh in their memory; and several perhaps, who witnessed them, were still living. Dion. Carth.  
**16** See Matt. 3:11. That baptism cannot be valid, in which the name of the Holy Ghost *only* is invoked. For, the tradition concerning life-giving grace, must be preserved entire. To add or to omit any thing, may exclude from life everlasting. For, as we believe, so also are we baptized, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. S. Basil, l. de Spirit. Sanc. c. xxii.—*Fire.* This is a metaphor, to signify the Holy Ghost and his gifts, particularly the fire of divine love to the expiation of sins, and is very common in Scripture. Sometimes also he is represented by water, as in S. John 4:10, et dein. and 7:38–9. Isai. 44 &c. &c. Hence, in the hymn to the Holy Ghost, the Church uses both figures.  
**17** By the barn-floor is here prefigured the Church of Christ, in which many are called, but few are chosen. This *perfect* cleansing of the floor, as it is in the Greek, is performed both here when the wicked, on account of their open crimes, are excluded from the communion of the faithful by the Church; or, on account of their hidden sins, are after death by infinite justice chastised; but most especially at the end of the world, when the Son of man shall send his angels to gather from his kingdom all scandals. Ven. Bede.  
**19** See in S. Mark 6:17. *The wife of his brother* (Philip.) The Greek adds the name, and he is also named in S. Mark; but he is a different person from the tetrarch, mentioned in c. 3 v. 1. V.—It was not at this time that John was cast into prison; but, as S. John relates, after our Saviour had begun to work miracles, and after his baptism. S. Luke anticipates this event, in order to describe more strongly the malice of Herod; who, whilst he saw multitudes flocking to hear the words of John, his own soldiers believing, and all the people receiving baptism, still could despise the Baptist, could imprison him, and put him to death. Ven. Bede.  
**21** The motive of his baptism, as he himself informs us, was, that he himself might fulfil all justice. What is here meant by justice, but that obligation of doing first ourselves what we wish others to do?—Let no one then refuse the laver of grace, since Christ did not refuse the laver of penance. S. Amb.—Although all our sins are forgiven in baptism, still the frailty of the flesh is not yet perfectly strengthened. For, after passing this red sea, we rejoice at the destruction of the Egyptians, but still we must fight with assurance of the grace of Christ, against the enemies we shall undoubtedly meet with in the desert of this world, till at length we arrive at our true country. Ven. Bede.—It is said *the heavens were opened*, because they had been hitherto shut. The sheepfolds of heaven and earth are now united under the one Shepherd of the sheep: heaven is opened, and man, though formed of the earth, is admitted to the company of angels. S. Chrys.  
**22** The reason why the Holy Ghost shewed himself in the shape of a dove, was because he could not be seen in the substance of his divinity. But why a dove? To express that simplicity acquired in the sacrament of baptism. *Be ye simple as doves;* to signify that peace bestowed by baptism, and prefigured by the olive branch which the dove carried back to the ark, a true figure of the Church, and which was the only security from the destructive deluge. S. Amb.—You will object: Christ, though he was God, would not be baptized till the age of 30, and do you order baptism to be received sooner? When you say, *though he was God*, you solve the difficulty. For, he stood not in need of being purified at all; of course, there could be no danger in deferring his baptism. But you will have much to answer for, if, being born in corruption, you pass out of this world without the garment of incorruption. S. Greg. Nazian. orat. 40.  
**36** *Who was of Cainan.* Notwithstanding the veneration due to the Latin Vulgate, which is to be esteemed authentic, Corn. a Lapide calls it a chronological problem, whether the word Cainan be the true reading, or whether it hath slipt into the text. It is true Cainan is found in the Sept. Gen. 10:24. Gen. 11:14. and 1 Paral. 1:18; though, in this last place, a Lapide says, it is wanting in one edition of the Sept. by Sixtus V.; at least it is not read in all those places, neither in the Hebrew, nor Latin Vulgate. Some say that here in S. Luke’s text, is found Cainan, because his citations are conformable to the Sept. Others conjecture that Cainan and Sale were only different names of one and the same person, so that the sense may be, *who was of Sale*, who is also Cainan. *Qui fuit Sale, qui & Cainan* *.* Wi.  
**38** What could be more beautiful, than that this holy race should begin from the Son of God, and be continued up to the Son of God; that the creature might go before in figure, and the Son of God might follow after in reality; that he who was made after the image of God, might first appear, that the true image of his eternal Father may descend from his glory. Thus did S. Luke mean to refer the origin of Christ to God, of whom he was the true and eternal Son. To shew this still more evidently, the evangelist had before introduced the Almighty speaking from heaven: *This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.* S. Amb.

## Chapter 4

**2** In collating the present narrative with that of S. Mat. it appears that Jesus Christ was not tempted till the expiration of forty days. V.—Many reasons may be assigned why Christ permitted himself to be tempted. 1st. To merit for man the grace of overcoming temptations. 2d. To encourage us under temptations. 3d. To teach us not to be cast down with temptations, however grievous they may be, since even Jesus Christ submitted to them. 4thly. To point out to us the manner in which we ought to behave in time of temptation. D. Dion.  
**3** The tempter here appears to endeavour to discover by stratagem whether Christ was the Son of God. He does not say, *if thou be the Son of God*, “pray” that these stones be made bread, which he might have said to any man; but “command,” effect by thine own authority, that this come to pass. If Christ had done this, the tempter would have instantly concluded, that Jesus Christ was the Son of God, since only God could effect such a miracle. D. Dion.  
**10** We have the devil here again citing Scripture, (Ps. 90 v. 11) [Read what is given on this subject in note on v. 6, c. 4. of S. Matthew’s gospel] which shews how very dangerous a thing it is to put the Scripture, in the first instance, indiscriminately into every, even the most illiterate person’s hands, without any previous disposition of the mind and heart, by study and prayer. How much more satisfactory must it be to be guided by the Church of God, which Christ has promised to secure against all error, and which he commands all to obey! How much more rational to begin with distributing elementary catechisms, approved by the Catholic Church as conformable to the word of God, and then only opening to them the sacred mystic book, when their minds and hearts are better prepared to avail themselves of the inestimable treasure, and of justly appreciating and exploring the golden lore. If humility be a virtue that renders us most pleasing to God, it is a virtue particularly necessary for the proper understanding of Holy Writ. This will teach us to submit (whenever the Scripture is either silent or obscure in points of faith) our own private and unassisted judgment to the judgment and comments of the Church. This was the sentiment of a great philosopher of this nation, who, when charged with scepticism and a love of novelty by his contemporaries, replied: “However fanciful I may be esteemed in matters of philosophy, in religious concerns I like to go the beaten road. Where the Scripture is silent, the Church is my text. Where that speaks, it is but the comment; and I never refer any thing to the arbitration of my own judgment, but in the silence of them both.”  
**13** *For a time*, viz. until his Passion, in which he again most grievously tempted him, by the hands of impious persecutors, whom he could not overcome with sensuality, covetousness, or vanity. The devil now deals with men in the same manner. He tempts them, and, being overcome, leaves them for a time, to prompt them to rest in a fatal security; that indulging indolence, they may at some future period be attacked, with greater certainty of success, when unprepared. Knowing, therefore, the trick and design of our infernal enemy, how much does it behove us to be on our guard; and having overcome in one temptation, prepare ourselves for another; never resting in the presumptuous thought, that we are sufficiently strong in virtue to resist the enemy, without fresh preparation. D. Dion.—This history of the various temptations to which our Saviour subjects himself, as related by S. Luke, is exactly the same as that given by S. Matt. with this only difference, that the order in which the temptations took place is not the same in both evangelists: but it does not matter what order is observed, where all the circumstances are related. S. Austin.  
**17** *As he unfolded the book:* and again, (v. 20) *when he had folded the book.* Books at that time where not like our now-a-days, but were skins or parchments, rolled or folded up. Wi.—Some are of opinion that the Jews of Nazareth, having heard of the miracles and fame of Jesus, and that he was accustomed to teach in the synagogues, though he had never been instructed in any learning, when he rose to speak, purposely gave him the book of Isaias, which was esteemed the most difficult to be explained, in order to try his learning; though it is probable that it was done by the all-directing interposition of Divine Providence. Maldonatus.  
**18** By the poor are to be understood the Gentiles; who might truly be called poor, since they possessed neither the knowledge of the true God, nor of the law, nor of the prophets. Origen.—Isaias in this place speaks of himself, as a figure of the Messias. The captivity of Babylon, which is the literal object of this prophecy, was a figure of the then state of mankind; the return from this captivity announced by the prophet, and effected by Cyrus, represented the redemption of man, effected by Jesus Christ. V.  
**19** *To set at liberty them that are bruised*, or oppressed. These words are not in the prophet; but are added by S. Luke, to explain the others.—*To preach the acceptable year*, as it were the jubilee year, when slaves used to be set at liberty. Wi.  
**20** To observe and admire a person that had never learned letters, and who stood up amongst them an experienced teacher. Menochius. See John 7:15 and Maldonatus.  
**21** By this Christ wished to shew that he was the Messias foretold by the prophet Isaias, whom they so anxiously expected: he declares himself to be the person pointed out by the prophet. There seems also to be a secret reprehension in these words of Christ; as if he were to say: Why are you so desirous to behold the Messias, whom, when he is before your eyes, you will not receive? Why do you seek him in the prophets, when you neither understand the prophets, nor perceive the truth of their predictions, when they are fulfilled before you eyes? Maldonatus.  
**23** I see you will object to me this similitude, (παραβολην) or trite saying, applied to such as attended to the concerns of others, and neglected their own. Menochius.  
**30** *Passing t* *hrough the midst of them, went his way.* Perhaps by making himself on a sudden invisible, or by striking them with blindness, or by changing their minds, and hearts, as he pleased. Wi.—All commentators observe on these words, that the evangelist wished to shew that Christ worked a miracle on this occasion, and by it proved his divinity. This is the opinion of SS. Euthymius, Ambrose, and Thomas. S. Ambrose says, we must observe that Christ did not suffer from necessity, but because he wished it. He was not taken by the Jews, but delivered up himself; at his own pleasure he is seized, and at his own pleasure he escapes; when he wills it, he is condemned; and when he wills it, he is freed. The most common opinion is, that he rendered himself invisible on this occasion; though others imagine that he changed their wills, or withheld their hands. Maldon.—When we observe the outrageous treatment Jesus Christ met with from the people of Nazareth, we are not surprised that he should shut up the fountain of his beneficence against them for their incredulity, and return to Capharnaum. A.  
**31** Although Christ was well acquainted with the obduracy of the Jews, nevertheless, like a good physician, he condescends to pay them another visit, and try what a fresh medicine might effect in this their last stage, as it were, of existence. He publicly preaches therefore in the synagogue, according as Isaias had declared of him, and struck amazement into every heart. The Jews themselves considered him as something very extraordinary; as one of the prophets, or ancient saints. But Christ, that they might conceive a higher opinion of his person, does not make use of the expressions they did, but speaks as Lord and Master of the law. S. Cyril.  
**38** It is evident that S. Peter was married; but after his call to the apostleship, he left his wife, as S. Jerom writes, in ep. xliii. C. ii. ad Julianum, and l. i. adv. Jovin. See Matt. 19:29.  
**40** The evangelist mentions this circumstance, because these distressed people did not dare to bring their sick before that time, either through fear of the Pharisees, or of violating the sabbath. Origen.  
**41** It appears, that when the devil expresses himself thus, it is less through conviction than artifice. He suspected the fact; and to certify the same, he said to him in the desert, *if you be the Son of God*, change these stones into bread. In the same manner by saying here, *you are the Son of God*, he wished to give him an occasion of explaining himself on the subject. V.—But Jesus Christ would not accept of the testimony of evil spirits, lest he might be suspected of some intelligence with them, to cause himself to be acknowledged the Son of God. Ibid.  
**43** From the apparent good dispositions of these people, we might be induced to think, that if Christ had yielded to their solicitations, and remained with them, he could have drawn all to himself; yet he did not choose to do this, but has left us an example worthy of our imitation, in seeking out the perishing and strayed sheep; for by the salvation of one soul, our many sins will be remitted. S. Chrys. in cat. Græc. Pat. hom. in Matt.  
**44** Our divine Redeemer frequented the Jewish synagogue, to shew he was no seducer. If he had inhabited wilds and deserts, it might have been objected to him, that he concealed himself, like an impostor, from the sight of men. S. Chrys. Ibid.

## Chapter 5

**1** What S. Luke here gives till v. 10, is mentioned purposely to shew on what occasion, and by what miracle, Peter, Andrew, James, and John, were called. Maldon.  
**2** *Washing their nets* *.* See S. Matt. 4:18. and S. Mark 1:16, where it is said, that Christ saw them when they were *casting their nets;* i.e. some of them were *casting*, others *washing*, or *mending*, their nets. A.  
**20** Great is the Lord, who pardons men on account of the merits of others. If you are diffident of the pardon of your grievous sins, have recourse to the Church. She will pray for you; and the Almighty, at her intercession, will grant you that pardon he might have denied to your prayers. S. Ambrose, l. v. in Luc.  
**21** How great is the madness of this unbelieving people, who confessing that God alone can forgive sins, will not believe God when he grants pardon. S. Ambrose.—They indeed spoke the truth, for none can forgive sins but God only, who forgives our offences by the ministry of others, to whom he has committed this power, both in baptism and penance. But Christ, by forgiving sins as God, i.e. with his own power, clearly proves to all his divinity. Ven. Bede.  
**24** *The Son of man … on earth.* By which act, says S. Cyril, it is clear that the Son of man hath power on earth to remit sins; which he said both for himself and us. For he, as God-man, the Lord of the law, forgiveth sins; and we also have obtained by him that wonderful grace when he said to his disciples: *Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them.* John 20:23. And how should he not be able to remit sins, who gave others the power to do the same? B.  
**26** At the sight of the exertion of divine power, the Jews would rather fear than believe; for had they believed they would never have feared, but rather loved; for perfect love excludes fear. S. Ambrose.  
**28** The profane Julian charged S. Matthew with levity, in leaving all and following a stranger at one word. But hereby is seen the marvellous efficacy of Christ’s word and internal working, which in a moment can alter the heart of man, and cause him to despise what before was most near and dear to him. And this was done not only whilst Christ was living on earth, but daily in his Church. Thus S. Anthony, S. Francis, and others, hearing this word in the Church, forsook all and followed Jesus. S. Jer. in Matt. ix. S. Athan. in vita. S. Anton. August. Confess. l. viii. c. 11. Bonav. in vit. S. Francisci.  
**29** *And Levi made him a great feast*, to testify his gratitude to Jesus for the favour he had done him. It appears that both S. Mark and S. Luke affect, through consideration for S. Matthew, to designate him here by his less known name of *Levi;* whereas he designates himself, through humility, in this same circumstance, by his more known appellation of *Matthew.* See Matt. 9:9. V.  
**31** Jesus Christ gives them here to understand, that they were of the number of those who languished under a severe indisposition, and that he was come to act as their Physician. S. Chrysos. hom. xxxi in Matt.  
**33** S. Matt. says, it was S. John’s disciples themselves that objected this to Christ. Most probably both they and the Pharisees endeavoured all they could to press this objection. S. Austin de cons. Evang. l. ii. c. 27.—Why do you not fast, as is customary with all that wish to regulate their lives according to the law? The reason why the saints fasted was, that they might, by afflicting their bodies, subdue their passions. Jesus Christ, therefore, had no need of fasting, being God, and of course free from every, the least, disorderly motion of concupiscence. Neither did his attendants stand in need of fasting, for being enriched with his grace, they were strengthened in virtue, without the help of fasting. When, therefore, Christ fasted forty days, he fasted to set an example to carnal men. S. Cyril.—As long as the Spouse is with us, we are in joy, we cannot fast, we cannot mourn. But when he has been driven away by sin, then we must both fast and weep. Ven. Bede.

## Chapter 6

**1** As this chapter is almost verbally like to the 5th, 7th, and 12th of S. Matthew, and the 3d of S. Mark, the reader is referred to these for further explanation.—*On the second-first sabb* *ath.* An obscure passage, on which S. Jerom says to Nepotianus, [1] that he consulted his master, S. Greg. Nazianzen, but in vain. S. Chrys. Hom. xl. in Matt. takes it for a *double feast*, or *a double re* *st:* by which we may either understand a sabbath, and another feast concurring on the same day; or a sabbath and a feast immediately succeeding to each other. Theophylactus says the same; and that then the latter day, on which they were to rest, was called the *second-first.* Others say, that when the Jews kept their solemn paschal feast for seven days, the *last day* was called the *second-first*, because it was kept with equal solemnity as the first day had been. See Maldonatus. Later interpreters have found out other expositions, of which the most plausible seems to be, that by *the second-first sa* *bbath* may be understood the *feast of Pentecost* (which also happened when corn was ripe in Palestine). To understand this we must take notice, that the Jews had three great and solemn feasts: 1. That of the *Pasch*, or the great paschal feast, with the seven days of *unleavened bread;* the 2d. was the great *feast of Pentecost;* and the 3d. was the *feast*, called of *tabernacles.* It is supposed then that the *paschal feast* was called the *first-first sabbath*, that *Pentecost* was called the *second-first sabbath*, and that of *tabernacles* the *third-first*, or great *sabbath.* Wi.  
**2** The Scribes and Pharisees boasted much, as do many modern teachers, of their great knowledge of Scriptures, but our Saviour often sheweth their profound ignorance. B.  
**13** These twelve Christ chose as individual companions and domestics. To these he committed the charge of founding and governing his Church. He sent them as legates, or ambassadors, (for this is the import of the word *apostle*) to all the world. Hence their power was more universal than that of bishops, which is confined to their own dioceses or districts. The jurisdiction of the apostles was not limited to place. Tirinus.—This power which Jesus Christ delegated to his apostles, and which was for the benefit and regulation of the universal Church in all future ages, the apostles, in their turn, delegated to their successors in the ministry, with such regulations and limitations as have been judged in the Holy Ghost necessary for the proper government of the spiritual kingdom of God upon earth. And it is the height of presumption to question any ordinations that come to us with the authority of the Catholic Church: for, “whatever the Church says, is true; whatever she permits is lawful; whatever she forbids, is evil; whatever she ordains, is holy; whatever she institutes, is good.” S. Augustine.—How futile then is the objection of Calvin, who pretends, that an apostle, being nothing but a legate, can make no laws, nor prescribe or teach any thing not expressed in his *mandatum!* Calv. Inst. l. iv. c. 8.  
**16** *Judas*, surnamed Thaddeus in S. Matt. x. 3. and in S. Mark 3:18. At the head of his epistle he styles himself Judas, brother of James. V.  
**17** To a more extended and even part of the mountain, as we learn from comparing this text with S. Matt. 5:1. as it was from the mountain that Jesus Christ addressed to the people the following discourse. V.  
**20** S. Matt. (5:3. 10) mentions eight beatitudes, S. Luke only four; but S. Luke only gives an abridgment in this place of the discourse, which S. Matt. gives more at length. We are also to remark, that in these four the whole eight are comprised, and that both evangelists place poverty in the first place, because it is the first in rank, and, as it were, the parent of the other virtues; for he who hath forsaken earthly possessions, deserves heavenly ones. Neither can any man reasonably expect eternal life, who is not willing to forsake all in affection, and in effect also, if called upon for the love of Jesus Christ. S. Ambrose.—Not that every one under great poverty is happy, but that the man who prefers the poverty of Christ to the riches of the world, ought certainly to be esteemed such. Many indeed are poor in worldly substance, but are avaricious in affection; to such as these poverty is no advantage. Nothing that is against the will, merits reward; therefore all virtue is known by the will. Blessed, therefore, are the poor, who bear poverty for the sake of Christ: he himself hath already trodden the path before us, and taught us by his example that it leads to honour and enjoyment. S. Cyril, ap. T. Aquin.  
**24** Jesus Christ having declared how meritorious poverty of spirit was to eternal life, proceeds to denounce heavy chastisements upon the rich and proud. Idem Ibidem.—Although in great riches there are great inducements to sin, yet there are not wanting even in that state great incitements to virtue; neither is this wo aimed against those who abound in affluence; but against “those who abuse that affluence which Providence has bestowed upon them: Non enim census, sed affectus, in crimine est.” S. Ambrose.  
**25** As before he promised blessings to those that hunger, that weep, that are outcasts for Christ’s sake; so here, and in the next verse, he denounces curses to such as are filled, that laugh, and are praised; i.e. to such, as so far seek their beatitude in present enjoyment, as to become indifferent with regard to the good things of the next world. A.  
**26** *Wo to you, when men shall bless you.* The ministers of the gospel must not value themselves, when they are applauded by men; for so did the *fore-fathers* of the Jews, formerly commend the false prophets, when they flattered the people, and spoke things that were pleasing to them. Wi.  
**30** Jesus Christ does not order us never to refuse a petition: but the meaning of his words is, that we are to give what is just and reasonable, what will be neither injurious to yourself nor your family; for what is unjustly asked, may be justly denied. S. Austin, l. x. c. 40. de serm. Dom. in Monte.—But in this, the sin we commit is often far from trivial; particularly, when to the refusal of a just request, we add also reprehensions and complaints. For why, say we, does he not labour? why has he reduced himself to penury, through his own indolence?—But, tell me, do you live upon the fruits of your own industry? On the supposition that you do, is it not that you may have some plea to reprehend another for the morsel of bread he begs at your hands? You give him no charitable relief, give him then no contumelious words: if you have no compassion for him yourself, do not prevent others from shewing him commiseration. Abraham, in the number of guests he received, had the honour of receiving under his roof even angels. Let us not, therefore, be strict and unfavourable judges in regard of our suffering and distressed neighbours, lest perhaps we ourselves come to be more severely judged. S. Chrys. collected from hom. xxi. in ep. ad. Rom.—Hom. xi. in ep. ad. Heb. and hom. ii. de Lazaro.  
**35** *Hoping for nothing*, but merely impelled by a desire of doing good. They who only give when sure of having a greater return, do not give, but traffic with their generosity; in which there is no charity. A.  
**37** What can be imagined more kind, what more merciful, than this conduct of our Sovereign Lord, that the sentence of the judge should be left in the hands of the person to be judged? Jans. Comment. in sanct. Evang.  
**38** Here all solicitude of diffidence, all delay of avarice, is cut off; for what truth promises to repay, humility may safe expend. S. Leo. Serm. vi.  
**48** That man buildeth safely who hath both faith and good works; whereas the man that trusteth to his faith alone, to his reading or knowledge of Scripture, and doth not work and live accordingly, buildeth on sand. B.

## Chapter 7

**1** It was not immediately after he had spoken the preceding words that Christ entered Capharnaum, for in the interim he healed the man afflicted with the leprosy, according as S. Matthew related it in its proper place. S. Austin.  
**2** This history, though different in some circumstances from that related by S. Matt. c. 8 is most likely a relation of the same event, and the apparent discrepancies may be easily reconciled. S. Matt. says it was the centurion’s boy; S. Luke calls him his servant: but in these terms there is no necessary contradiction. And whereas the former says the centurion went himself to Christ, S. Luke mentions that he sent the ancients, or senators, of the Jews. Here, as in other places, we may suppose, that the former evangelist, for the sake of brevity, attributes to the centurion what was done in his name and with his authority; and through the whole narrative he represents our Saviour answering the centurion as if personally present. Jans. concord. Evan.  
**3** When S. Luke says that the centurion begs of our Lord to come to him, he must not be supposed to contradict S. Matt. who says, that the centurion objected he was not worthy to receive him under his roof. S. Luke seems here to relate the words of the Jews, who most probably would stop the centurion as he was going to Christ, and promise to intercede with our Lord for him. S. Chrysos. hom. xxvii in Matt.—Some pretend that the centurion, after having sent to Jesus, went himself; but there is no necessity for such a supposition. We see in another case, that the petition of the sons of Zebedee, made by them to Jesus Christ, according to S. Mark (10:35) was made to him by the mouth of their mother, according to S. Matt. 20:20. And this the old adage also teaches: *qui facit per ali* *um, facit per se* *;* what a man does by another, he does by himself.  
**6** Jesus Christ went with them, not because he could not cure him, when absent, but that he might set forth the centurion’s humility for our imitation. He would not go to the child of the ruler of the synagogue, lest he might appear to be induced by the consideration of his consequence and riches; but he went to the centurion’s servant, that he might appear to despise his humble condition. S. Amb.  
**9** Our Lord does not speak of the patriarchs, but of the Israelites of his own time, with whose faith he compares and prefers that of the centurion, because they had the assistance of the law and of the prophets; but this man, without any such instruction, willingly believed. V. Bede.  
**11** *Naim* is a city of Galilee, about two miles from Mount Thabor. It was by divine dispensation, that so very great a multitude was present on this occasion, in order to witness this stupendous miracle. Ven. Bede.—The burying-places of the Jews were out of the precincts of the city, as well for the preservation of health as decency. Thus Joseph of Arimathea, had his sepulchre in the rock of Mount Calvary, which was out of the city. Tirinus.  
**12** The evangelist seems to relate this miracle, as if it had happened by mere accident; though, beyond a doubt, divine Providence disposed all things to increase the splendour of the miracle. Jesus Christ would not raise this young man to life before he was carried out to be buried, that he might meet him near the gates of the city, where the assembly of the people took place. Besides this, there were present both the multitude that followed Jesus, and the multitude that followed the corpse, to the end that all these might be eye-witnesses to the miracle, and many might praise God, as Ven. Bede remarks. It was very proper that Christ should work this miracle just as he was entering the city, that he might preach the gospel with better success, from the opinion they must form of him, after beholding so great a miracle, and so great a favour bestowed upon them. Maldonatus.—In a few words, the evangelist paints to life the affliction of this distressed widowed parent: a mother and a widow, without the least hopes of children, deprived of him who was her only support, the life of her habitation, the source of all her maternal tenderness and satisfaction, now in the prime of health, the only branch of her succession, and the staff of her old age. S. Greg. of Nyssa, de hominis opificio.  
**14** Here Christ shews that he raised the dead by his own power, and at his own command: *I say to thee, arise.* This shews that it is the voice of God that speaks; for the dead can hear the voice of him alone, according to S. John. *Amen, I say to you, the hour cometh, and now* *is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they who hear shall live.* S. John 5:25. Maldon.—Our Saviour is not like Elias, weeping for the son of the widow of Sarepta; nor Eliseus, who applied his own body to the body of the dead child; nor Peter, who prayed for Tabitha: but he it is that calls the things that are not, as those that are; who speaks to the dead as to the living. Titus Bostrensis.  
**16** *And there came a fear on them all;* i.e. a certain reverential awe and trepidation seized them, and an uncommon degree of astonishment at the divinity which appeared to them. Menoch.—*And they glorified God:* (εδοξαπαν) they gave praise and glory to God for thus visiting his people, by sending them the Saviour he had promised them. Polus synop. crit.  
**20** *The men;* (οι ανδρες) viz. the two disciples sent by John, who delivered their master’s message; but, before Jesus Christ undertook to reply to their question, he performed on the spot various kinds of miracles.  
**22** **Ver** **.** **22** **.** Then addressing himself to these disciples of John, he ordered them to go and relate to their master all they had seen and heard; and to tell him, that he declared all those to be happy, who, strong in faith, should not take occasion to doubt of his divine power, (the proofs of which they had so recently seen) from the weakness of his flesh, which he had taken upon himself for the love of man.—Jesus Christ alludes to the known and full testimonies that had been given of him by the prophets. *The Lord giveth food to the hungry, the Lord looseth them that are in fetters, the Lord enlightene* *th the blind, he lifteth up them that are cast down, … and he who does these things, shall reign for ever thy God, O Sion, from generation to generation.* Ps. 145 S. Ambrose.—The words of the prophet Isaias are not less descriptive of the promised Messias: *God himself will come, and will save you. Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped. The lame man shall lea* *p as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall be free.* Isai. 35:4, 5, 6. Theophylactus.  
**26** Because the Scripture styles him an angel; or, because he is the immediate precursor of him whom all the prophets announced at a distance.  
**29** *Justified God;* i.e. feared and worshipped God, as just, merciful, &c. Wi.—There are only two different sets of men, who glorified God for the baptism of John, and these seemed the most remote from works of piety; viz. the ignorant multitude, who scarcely knew the law; and the publicans, who were in general the most avaricious of mortals, and were looked upon as public sinners. If the preaching of the Baptist had such an effect upon these men; what kind of hearts must not the Scribes have had, who, with all the advantage of the knowledge of the law, still refused to believe? This verifies the saying of our Lord, in S. Matt. c. 21:31: *Amen, I say unto you, that the publicans and harlots shall go into the kingdom of heaven before you.* Maldon.—God has hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and has revealed them to little ones; (S. Luke, 10:21) for so it hath seemed good in his sight. Ibid.  
**32** *Speaking one to another:* (προσφωνουσιν αλληλοις) they seem to have been alternate choirs of youths, answering each other in the above words. Menochius.  
**36** *And one of the Pharisees*, by name *Simon*, as we learn in v. 40.  
**37** *A woma* *n in the city, who was a sinner.* Some say she had only been of a vain airy carriage; one that loved to be admired for her beauty and wit; but the common exposition and more conformable to the text, is, that she had been of a lewd, debauched life and conversation. Wi.—Mary Magdalene.  
**38** Jesus Christ was then at table, after the manner of the Orientals, reclined at length on a couch, a little raised from the ground, having his face turned towards the table, and his feet extended. He had quitted his sandals, according to the custom of the country, before he had laid himself on the couch.  
**39** The Pharisee was egregiously deceived. 1. In thinking that Christ was ignorant of the character of the woman, when he not only clearly saw the past bad conduct of the woman, but the present unjust thoughts of the Pharisee; 2. in his erroneous inference that Christ could not be a prophet; for all things are not necessarily revealed by God to his prophets; 3. by judging of Christ, after his own and the other Pharisees’ treatment of sinners; who, elated with pride, and thinking themselves just, kept all public sinners at a respectful distance; whereas not those who are well, but such as are sick, need the physician. Menochius.  
**42** Which will love him most? as we read in the Protestant version, and in the Greek, αγαπησει. But Christ, seeming to require love as a previous disposition to the remission of sins, as appears from v. 47 infra, the Catholic Church has adopted the version of S. Austin, hom. xxiii. in the present tense: quis ergo plus eum diligit? Jans. Comment. in Evang.  
**43** In proportion to our sins, should be our grief, says S. Cyprian: ut pœnitentia non sit minor crimine. l. de lapsis.  
**47** *Many sins are forgiven her, because she hath loved much.* In the Scripture, an effect sometimes seems attributed to one only cause, when there are divers other concurring dispositions; the sins of this woman, in this verse, are said to be forgiven, because *she l* *oved much;* but (v. 50,) Christ tells her, *thy faith hath saved thee.* In a true conversion are joined faith, hope, love, sorrow, and other pious dispositions. Wi.  
**50** This is one of those places upon which modern sectaries lay so much stress, in order to prove that faith alone can save us. But if they will attentively consider the different parts of this history, they will easily discover the fallacy of their argument. Because, before Christ spoke these words: *thy faith*, &c. he had said to Magdalene: *many sins are forgiven her, because she hath loved much.* Therefore she was justified not so much through her faith, as her charity: still she had faith, or she would not have come to Jesus, to be delivered from her sins. It was therefore her faith, working by charity, that justified her: and this is the doctrine of the Catholic Church. Nevertheless, she had not that faith, which modern sectaries affirm to be necessary for their justification, viz. a belief that they are already justified, and that their sins are forgiven: this faith the woman here mentioned had not before Christ spoke those words to her; for it was to obtain the remission of her sins, that she performed so many offices of charity, washing his feet with her tears, &c. But is may be asked, why then does Christ attribute her salvation to her faith? The answer is easy, and has often been given, viz. that faith is the beginning of salvation; for it was her faith that brought her to Christ: for had not the woman believed in him, she never would have come to him to obtain the remission of her sins. Maldonatus.

## Chapter 8

**2** Mention is made in the gospels, of a woman who was a sinner, (Luke 7) of Mary of Bethania, the sister of Lazarus, (John 11 and 12 Mark 14 Matt. 26) and of Mary Magdalene, who followed Jesus from Galilee, and ministered to him. Many think all this to belong to one and the same person: others think these were three distinct persons. See the arguments on both sides in Alban Butler’s Lives of Saints, July 22d; and also more at large in the dissertations upon the three Marys, at the conclusion of the harmony in the Bible de Vence.  
**3** *The wife of Chusa, Herod’s steward.* Lit. his *procurator*, as in the Rheims translation. The Greek signifies one that provides for another, or manages his concerns. The same word is used, Matt. 20:8 and Gal. 4:2. Wi.—The Greek word is επιτροπου. It was the custom of the Jews, says S. Jerom, that pious women should minister of their substance, meat, drink, and clothing, to their teachers going about with them. But as this might have given cause of scandal among the Gentiles, S. Paul mentions that he allowed it not. 1 Cor. 9:5. 12. They thus ministered to our Lord and his apostles of their worldly substance, from whom they received spiritual riches.  
**8** *Ears to hear, let him hear*, &c. i.e. he that is willing to hear the word of God, and diligently comply with what is therein commanded, let him be attentive to the words of Christ. For the sight, hearing, and other senses, were not given to man to be used only as beasts use them, but likewise that they might profit his soul to eternal life. Tirinus.  
**9** After the multitude had left our divine Saviour, his disciples wishing thoroughly to understand the meaning of his instructions, came to him, and desired he would give them an explanation of the parable. Tirinus.  
**14** The sense of the Greek text is: they produce no fruit that arrives at maturity. V.  
**16** Our Lord calls himself the lighted candle, placed in the middle of the world. Christ was by nature God, and by dispensation man: and thus, not unlike a torch placed in the middle of a house, does our Lord, seated in the soul of man, illumine all around him. But by the candlestick, is understood the Church, which he illuminates by the refulgent rays of his divine word. S. Maximus.—By these expressions, Jesus induces his audience to be very diligent, and quite alive in the momentous affair of salvation; informing them that they are placed in the public view of the whole world. S. Chry. hom. xv. in Matt.  
**18** He here exhorts his audience to attend to what he was about to deliver, and to apply themselves with all their attention to the divine word; for he who has a desire of hearing the word, shall also receive the grace and power of understanding it. But the man who has no desire of hearing it, though from his learning he might expect to understand it, shall not understand it, because he does not willingly attend to the divine admonitions; hence it is said, *Whosoever hath, to him also shall b* *e given.* Ven. Bede.  
**20** These brethren were not the sons of the blessed Virgin Mary, mother of God, as Helvidius wickedly taught; nor yet the sons of Joseph, by another wife; for, as S. Jerom writeth, not only Mary, but Joseph also, observed virginity. Contra Helvidium, c. ix. et ibidem, c. viii.—In the scriptural idiom, cousins are called brethren. B.  
**21** There is no tie of affinity and friendship so proper, and so becoming man, as that made by faith in Christ, and strengthened by charity. Tirinus.  
**22** *And they launched forth:* lit. *they went up.* The sense is, being gone abroad, they set forward, or launched forth, as in the Prot. translation. Wi.  
**23** *And they were filled;* i.e. the little ship was filled with water. Wi.  
**24** In this Christ evidently shews two distinct natures; his human nature, denoted by his sleep; and his divine nature by stilling the tempest at sea. Ven. Bede.  
**25** After Christ had appeased the storm at sea, the disciples, all astonishment at the miracle, began to whisper to each other, saying, *Who is this?* not that the disciples were ignorant of whom they were speaking, but they wondered at his mighty works, and at the glory of his divine power. S. Amb.  
**26** Here S. Matt. relates the history of the two demoniacs, whilst S. Mark and S. Luke speak only of one; but the man mentioned in these two evangelists, was a man of some consideration and consequence, for whose cure the country was deeply interested. S. Austin de concord. evang.  
**28** This is not a voluntary confession, which merits a reward, but a forced acknowledgment, extorted against their wills. Like fugitive servants, who, when they meet their masters, think of nothing but of deprecating punishment. The devils think our Lord is come down upon earth to judge them. S. Jerom.—The torment from which this devil desires to be freed, is the pain and affliction he would suffer by being forced to yield to the power of Christ, in leaving the man; not the general torment of hell, to which he knew he was unchangeably and irrevocably condemned. He was also tormented with the fear, lest he should be now consigned to those eternal pains before his time, as it is expressed in S. Matt. For, though the evil spirits are unavoidably condemned, and already suffer the chief torments of hell, yet the rigorous fulfilment of all is deferred to the day of judgment. Jans. conc. Evang.  
**30** He did not put the question through ignorance of his name, but that his answer might shew forth the divine power in a more glorious manner; as also for our instruction, that knowing the great number of our invisible enemies, we might work out our salvation with fear and trembling, placing all our confidence in God. Dion. Carth.  
**32** If, says S. Athanasius, the infernal spirits have no power over such impure beasts as swine, with much greater reason then are they deprived of power over man, who is made after God’s own image, and redeemed by the blood of his son, Christ Jesus. We should therefore fear only God, and despise the devil. In vit. S. Ant.  
**33** This event shews what was before asserted, that many devils had possession of the man. The obstinacy of the Sadducees, who denied the existence of evil spirits, was thus likewise refuted; as well as the cavils of certain moderns, who pretend that these effects which appeared in the demoniacs, were not produced by the power of the devil, but were the consequences of some violent natural malady. Jans. conc. Evang.  
**41** See this explained in Matt. 9 and Mark 5.  
**43** *All her substance;* (ολον τον βιον) i.e. all that she had to live upon.  
**45** All denied that they had *designedly* touched him, though, on account of the pressure of the crowd, many *unwillingly* touched him. Menochii Commentaria.  
**48** **Ve** **r.** **48** **.** Παρα του αρχισυναγωγου, which some interpret, from the house of the ruler. M.—In vain do you trouble him. Idem. Ibid.  
**55** This returning of the souls again, to reanimate the bodies of those whom Christ and his apostles raised from death, (and especially Lazarus, who had been dead four days) doth evidently prove the immortality of the soul. From this place we may also conclusively infer against our adversaries, who say, that every one goeth straight to heaven or hell, that it is not probable that they were called from the one or the other; and therefore from some third place.

## Chapter 9

**1** *Over all devils;* so that none should be able to resist them. For all were not equally easy to be expelled, as we shall see in this same chapter, in the person of a possessed child, whom the apostles could not heal, because they did not use prayer and fasting against it; and because their faith was not sufficiently strong and ardent. Calmet.  
**4** *And depart* [1] *not from thence.* In the ordinary Greek copies we find, and *depart from thence.* The sense appears, by the other evangelists, (Matt. 10:11 and Mark 6:10) that Christ gave this admonition to his disciples, not to change their lodging from house to house; but while they staid in a town, to remain in the same house. And though the negative be here omitted in the Greek, interpreters bring it to the same, by telling us that the sense is, *stay here*, and *depart from thence;* i.e. stay in that house, so that leaving the town, you may depart from the same house. Wi.  
**8** *Risen from the dead.* Herod was perplexed and in suspense about the report, that it was John that was risen from the dead.… From this it appears, that some of the Jews, and Herod himself, believed in some kind of metempsychosis, or transmigration of souls. Josephus says, (Antiq. lib. xviii, c. 2) that the Pharisees believed the soul to be immortal; and after death, to depart to some subterraneous places, where they received the recompense of good, or evil, according to their actions. There the souls of the wicked remain for ever, without the power of departing thence. The souls of the good sometimes returned, and entered other bodies. Herod probably thought that the soul of John Baptist was united to that of Christ, in the same body, and was thence enabled to perform new and more extraordinary functions. Such were the reveries of some of the Rabbins; who, as S. Jerom remarks, abused the passages of the gospel we are now explaining, in support of this Pythagorean doctrine. Most of the Jews believed the true doctrine of the resurrection, viz. that of the body; which must one day be renewed to life by the same soul which now animates it: and this is the doctrine of faith and of the Church, which she teaches you from both the Old and New Testament, instead of that transmigration of souls, which has no foundation or appearance of truth. It is probable that this error was widely diffused among the Jews, in our Saviour’s time. It was a doctrine suited to the taste of the Orientals. Some think they can see traces of it in the history of Elias. That prophet being taken away, and the Jews seeing Eliseus perform the same miracles, said, that the spirit of Elias had rested on him. Calmet.  
**18** *As he was alone praying:* i.e. remote from the people, though his disciples are said to *have been with him.* Wi.  
**27** *Kingdom of God.* This is generally understood of the transfiguration, in which Christ shewed to the three disciples an essay of his glory. Calmet.  
**28** *Mountain*, &c.—Since Christ has ascended the mountain, both to pray and to be transfigured, all of us who hope for the fruit of his resurrection, and long to see the king in his glory, must dwell in heaven by our thoughts, and apply our minds to continual prayer. Ven. Bede.  
**30** *And behold two men.* Moses and Elias, by ministering to our Lord in his glory, shewed him to be the Lord of both the Old and New Testament. The disciples also, upon seeing the glory of their fellow-creatures, would be filled with admiration at the condescension of their divine Master; and considering the delights of future happiness, be stirred up to a holy emulation of those who had laboured before them, and be fortified in their ensuing conflicts; for nothing so much lightens the present labour, as the consideration of the future recompense. S. Cyril.  
**31** *They spoke* *of his decease*, [2] or his *departure out of this world.* S. Peter useth the same Greek word for his death. 2 Pet. 1:15. Wi.  
**33** *It is good for us.* It is not good, O Peter, for Christ to remain always. Should he have remained there, the promise he had made thee would never have been fulfilled. Thou wouldst never have obtained the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and the reign of death would not have been destroyed. Seek not for joys before the time, as Adam sought to be made like God. The time will come, when thou shalt for eternity behold him, and reign with him who is life and light. Damasus Orat. de Transfigurat. Domini.—*Three tabernacles.* The Lord does appoint thee the builder, not of tabernacles, but of his whole Church. Thy disciples, thy sheep, have fulfilled thy desire, by erecting tabernacles for Christ and his faithful servants. These words of S. Peter, *let us make*, &c. were not spoken of himself, but by the prophetic inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Therefore it is added, he knew not what he said. Damasus, ut supra.—S. Peter knew not what he said, because by proposing to make three tabernacles for these three personages, he improperly ranked together, the servants and their Lord, the creature and the Creator. Titus Bostrensis.  
**35** *And a voice*, &c. This is the voice of the Father from the cloud, as if he should say, “I call him not one of my sons, but my true and natural Son, to the resemblance of whom all others are adopted. S. Cyril.—Not Elias, not Moses, but he whom you see alone, is my beloved Son. S. Ambrose.—Therefore, it is added: and when the voice was heard, Jesus was alone, lest any one should imagine these words, *This is my beloved Son*, were addressed to Moses or Elias.” Theophylact.  
**45** *They understood not this word.* They understood well enough what was meant by being delivered into the hands of his enemies, and being put to death; but they could not comprehend how Jesus Christ, whom they knew to be the Messias, and the Son of God, and whom they believed to be immortal, and eternal, could suffer death, or affronts and outrages from men. These ideas seemed incompatible; they perceived in them some mystery, which they could not penetrate. Calmet.  
**46** *And there entered a thought*, &c. It is improbable that all the disciples had fallen into this fault: but the evangelist, that he might not point out any in particular as guilty of it, says indiscriminately, that this thought had entered among them. S. Cyril. ex D. Thom.  
**49** *We forbade him.* S. John having the most love for his Lord, and being particularly beloved by him, thought all were to be excluded from these gifts, who were not obedient to his divine Master. S. Aug.—But we must remember, that not the minister is the author of these miracles, but the grace which is in him, who performs these wonders by virtue of the power of Christ. S. Cyril.—How wonderful is the power of Christ, who by his grace works miracles in the persons of the unworthy, and those that are not disciples; as men are sanctified by the priest, though the priest should not be in the state of grace! Theophylact.  
**50** *Forbid him not.* Our Lord is not moved by this event, to teach us that perfect virtue entertains no thoughts of revenge, and that anger cannot be found where the fulness of charity reigns. The weak must not be driven away, but assisted. Let the breast of the religious man be ever unmoved by passion, and the mind of the generous undisturbed by desires of revenge. S. Ambrose.  
**51** *The days of his assumption*, i.e. of his ascension into heaven. See the same Greek word. Mar. 16:19 and Acts 1:11.—*He steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem*, or literally, *he fixed* [3] *his countenance to go up to Jerusalem.*—And (v. 53) *because his face was of one going to Jerusale* *m.* These expressions come from the style of the Hebrews. See 4 Kings 12:17. Jerem. 42:15. Ezech. 4:3. The sense is, that the Samaritans perceived that he and his company were going up to adore in Jerusalem, at which they were displeased, having an antipathy against the Jews and their temple. Wi.—It is not here said, as some interpreters have believed, that his journey to Jerusalem was the last of his life, in which he was crucified. It appears from the context, that there were still many months before the death of Christ, and that this journey was probably for the feast of Pentecost. But that year was the last of the life of Jesus Christ and he already knew the dispositions of the Jews, and what was to befall him shortly. These words, *he set his face*, are often used in Scripture for obstinacy and hardness in evil. Prov. 7:13. 21:29. Jeremy 42:15. &c. But we may likewise take them to signify a strong resolution, and intrepid and inflexible firmness, to perform what you have resolved. Jesus Christ shewed by his air, by his conduct and discourse, that notwithstanding the malice of his enemies, he was determined to go to Jerusalem. Calmet.  
**52** *Messengers*, &c. S. Jerom believes that Christ sent true angels before him to announce his coming. The Greek word αγγελος, generally signifies an angel; but it likewise means a messenger. Most interpreters believe he sent James and John, to prepare what was necessary for provisions and lodging. This precaution was necessary, as he was always followed by great crowds. The history, from verse 51 to the end of the chapter, is mentioned by none of the evangelists, except S. Luke. Calmet.  
**54** *Wilt thou that we command fire*, &c. In the Greek is added as Elias *did.* These words might be first in the margin, and thence by transcribers taken into the text. The two apostles, called the *sons of thunder*, knew their Master was greater than Elias; and therefore they are for calling for fire from heaven, as he had done. Wi.—It was probably this trait in the life of James and John, which gained them the name of *boanerges*, the sons of thunder. Their too great zeal for the glory of Jesus Christ, and the spirit of revenge, of which they were not yet healed, caused them to make this petition; which seemed in some manner justified by the example of Elias, 4th book of Kings, chap. 1:10. Many editions have the addition of these words, *as* *Elias did.* Calmet.  
**55** *You know not of what spirit you are*, i.e. that my Spirit, which you ought to follow, is the Spirit of mercy, mildness, and patience. Wi.  
**56** *But to save* souls. It might be translated, to save *men’s lives;* [4] but is seems better here to stick to the letter, especially since in most Greek copies we read, the *souls of men.* Wi.  
**57** *Follow thee*, &c. Although the Sovereign Lord of all is most munificent, yet he does not lavish his gifts on all without distinction, but bestows them on the worthy only. When, therefore, this man offered to follow Christ, he answers him by telling him, that all who follow him, must daily take up their cross, and renounce the conveniences of this life. Thus he mentions what was reprehensible in his person. There appears likewise great presumption in his conduct, as he did not petition to be admitted, as other Jews did, but seems to claim the honour of the apostleship; an honour which none must assume, but such as are called by God. Heb. 5. S. Cyril in Divo Thoma.  
**60** *Bury their dead*, &c. Though this was an act of religion, yet it was not permitted him; that we may learn to prefer always the concerns of God to all human considerations. S. Ambrose.—However necessary this might appear, however easy, however short the time which it would take up, might be, it is not permitted him. Not the least delay can be allowed, although a thousand impediments stand in the way; for spiritual things must be preferred to things even the most necessary. Chrys. hom. xxviii on S. Matt.  
**62** *Putting his hand to the plough.* A proverb and metaphor, to signify that nothing must hinder a man from God’s service. Wi.—Christ seems here to allude to the call of Eliseus by Elias. The former was at the plough, and the latter called him. Immediately Eliseus quits his plough, runs with Elias’s permission to bid adieu to his father and mother, sacrifices two of his oxen, roasts them with the wood of the plough, and joins the company of the prophets. Jesus Christ wishes that all who follow him, should in like manner think of nothing else. Calmet.

## Chapter 10

**1** *Other seventy-two.* Most Greek copies, and the Syriac version, have seventy, as in the Prot. translation. Yet there seems no doubt but the true number was seventy-two. For seventy-two may be called seventy; but had they been only seventy, they could never have been called seventy-two. This was also the exact number of the judges chosen to assist Moses; (Exod. 24:1) though called seventy, (Numb. 11:16) as it is evident, because there were six chosen out of every one of the twelve tribes. In like manner the exact number of the interpreters called the Sept. must have been seventy-two; and also the just number of the Sanhedrim.—*Two and two*, that one might be a help and comfort to the other; as also a witness of the carriage and behaviour of his companion. Wi.  
**4** As Moses formerly chose twelve elders as princes and fathers of the twelve tribes of Israel, and afterwards gave to each of these elders six others, to assist them in the arduous work of governing the people, so our divine Saviour chose twelve apostles to govern his Church. He likewise afterwards gave six disciples to each apostle, which makes 72, to serve as priests, and assist in governing the Church. Tirinus.—*Salute no man*, i.e. go forwards promptly, and do not stay to amuse yourselves with vain compliments and useless civilities towards those whom you meet. This was a proverb. Eliseus said the same to Giezi, when he sent him to restore life to the child of the widow of Sunamis. If any man meet you, salute him not; think of nothing but of executing the orders I give you. Calmet.  
**15** *And thou,* *Capharnaum*, &c. Capharnaum is situated on the western coast of the sea of Tiberias. Christ having left Nazareth, made the former city the usual place of his abode. There was no city in which he had preached so much, or wrought so many miracles. On this account, he said it was exalted to the heavens; but for its incredulity he threatens it shall be cast down even unto hell. Calmet.  
**18** *I saw* Satan *as lightning*, &c. Many expound it in this manner: I, who am from eternity, saw Satan with all the rebellious angels, as glorious as they were, fall from heaven; fear then, and tremble, though you have received such favours from God. Others take it in this sense, that Christ, by his incarnation, hath seen the power of the devils lessened and confounded, according to what he also said, (Jo. 12:31.) *Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.* Wi.—What connexion have these words with what goes before? Some understand them thus: the reign of the devil is near at an end; this prince of darkness is going to be overturned; he will fall from the air, where he reigns, with the same precipitation as lightning, which cuts the clouds and presently disappears. It is almost the same thing he says in other places. “The prince of this world is already judged; behold now is the judgment of this world; behold now the prince of this world shall be cast forth! When I sent you to preach the gospel to the poor, I saw Satan fall; I saw his empire overturned. The last effort which this empire of darkness shall make is the death of our Saviour, as he himself says: This is your hour, and the power of darkness. Since his resurrection he has bound the dragon in the abyss for a thousand years; he has shut up the entrance, and sealed it with his seal.” Apoc. 12:9. 20:2. Others think that Jesus speaks here of the fall of Lucifer, at the beginning of the creation. Wishing to give his disciples a lesson in humility, on account of the vain complacency which he saw they took in the miracles they wrought, he says to them: Beware of pride, that precipitated the first angel from heaven: I have seen him in the glory with which he was surrounded, and I have seen him hurried into the abyss. Fear, lest the same should happen to you. The former explanation appears to us more simple and literal. Calmet.  
**19** *Given you power*, &c. By these words our Saviour seems to insinuate, that the venom of serpents, and the other noxious qualities of some animals, proceed from the malice of the devil. These are the arms and the instruments he makes use of to kill us, being the prince of death and a murderer from the beginning, as the Scripture styles him. The Jews attributed sickness, poisons, and every thing of the same kind to evil spirits.  
**21** *He rejoiced in the Holy Ghost.* In almost all Greek copies, we read in *spirit*, without *holy.* And it is expounded of Christ’s own spirit. Wi.—*I give thanks*, &c. In this verse we see plainly refuted the heretical Marcion, and his follower Manicheus, who asserted that God was not the creator of the earth, or of any thing existing on the earth. S. Epiphanius says, that in a gospel written by Marcion, the words *Father* and *earth* were entirely omitted. Who does not here deplore the blindness of heretics, who, in order to spread their errors, do not hesitate thus to corrupt the original Scripture received by the whole Christian world!!! D. Dion. Carth.  
**25** *Eternal life?* The law of Moses does not expressly promise eternal life to the observers of it, but confines its promises to temporal blessings during this life. Still we always find that the Jews hoped in another life after this. This opinion is clearly observable in the books of Scripture, written both before and after the captivity, and in Josephus and Philo. Calmet.  
**29** *Neighbour* *?* It appears this was a celebrated controversy among the doctors of the law; some probably affirming, that the Jews only were so; while others maintained that their friends alone were their neighbours. Maldonatus.  
**30** *A certain man*, &c. This some would have to be a history: others rather judge it spoken by way of parable, to teach us to perform offices of charity towards all men without exception. Wi.—Were we to adhere to the mere words of this parable, it would seem to follow, that only those who do us good were to be esteemed our neighbours; for the context seems to intimate, that the Levite and the priest were not neighbours to the man who fell among the robbers, because they did not assist him. But according to the opinion of most fathers, the intent of this parable is the shew, that every person who has need of our assistance is our neighbour. Maldonatus.  
**31** Our Saviour here shews the Jewish priests how preposterous was their behaviour, who, though scrupulously exact in performing all external acts of religion, entirely neglected piety, mercy, and other more essential duties. The Jews despised the Samaritans as wicked and irreligious men; but our Saviour here tells them that they were less exact in works of charity towards their neighbours than the very Samaritans. Tirinus.  
**34** This is the allegorical meaning of the parable: The man that *fell among robbers*, represents *Adam* and his posterity; *Jerusalem*, the state of peace and innocence, which man leaves by going down to *Jericho*, which means the moon, the state of trouble and sin: the *robbers* represent the devil, who *stripped* him of his supernatural gifts, and *wounded* him in his natural faculties: the *priest and Levite* represent the old law: the *Samaritan*, Christ; and the *beast*, his humanity. The *inn* means the Church; *wine*, the blood of Christ; *oil*, his mercy; whilst the host signifies S. Peter and his successors, the bishops and priests of the Church. Origen, S. Jerom, S. Ambrose, S. Austin, and others.  
**40** Calvin here ridicules the professors of evangelical poverty, because they gather from this place that there are two states of life, viz. the active and the contemplative, figured by Martha and Mary. But what will he answer, when he is informed, that this is the opinion not merely of monks, but even of a S. Austin, (Serm. xxvii, De verbis Domini,) of a S. Jerom, (Com. 3 cap. of Jeremiah,) of a S. Greg. and many others? Not that they were ignorant that there was another more natural explanation; but they were of opinion that nothing could be found more proper for the illustration of these different states of life. Maldonatus.  
**42** *One thing is necessary.* Some think that Christ’s meaning was, that Martha was preparing many dishes, when one was sufficient. But others, that this *one thing necessary*, was to learn, and comply with the will of God; which Mary was employed about. Wi.

## Chapter 11

**2** *Father, hallowed be thy name*, &c. See Matt. 6. In the ordinary Greek copies here are all the seven petitions, as in S. Matthew: and so they are in the Prot. Testament. Yet S. Aug. in his Enchiridion, (c. i. tom. 6, p. 240,) says there were read seven petitions in S. Matt. and only five in S. Luke. We may also take notice, that though in the Greek copies here in S. Luke are all seven petitions of the Lord’s prayer, yet the doxology, *for thine is the kingdom*, &c. is omitted in all Greek copies, and by the Protestants; which is a new argument and proof, that the said doxology is an addition from the Greek liturgy. Wi.  
**3** In the Greek it is called επιουσιον; i.e. supersubstantial. This is not the bread that goeth into the body, but the bread of eternal life, that supports the life of the soul. It is here called *daily* bread. Receive then daily, what will daily profit you; and continue so to live, that you may be daily in proper dispositions for receiving it. All who are under sin, have received a wound, and must seek for a cure. The cure is this heavenly and most venerable sacrament. S. Austin, Serm. ii. de verbo Dei.  
**4** Christ does not teach us to pray for afflictions of the body, but always enjoins us to pray, that we may not enter into temptation. When, therefore, temptation attacks us, we must beg of God grace to withstand it, that the promise in S. Matthew (chap. 10) may be fulfilled in us, he *who perseveres to the end shall be saved.* S. Bede in Reg. Brev. 221.  
**5** This parable is not found in any one of the evangelists, except S. Luke. Our Saviour having taught his disciples the aforesaid form of prayer, now shews them the utility and efficacy of prayer in general. He wishes to inculcate the necessity of perseverance in prayer. A friend comes to borrow of another friend at an unseasonable hour; his request is refused; he insists, and obtains, by his perseverance, what he could not have gained without it. Thus also the Almighty wishes to be importuned; he wishes us to pray with zeal and perseverance. This is the model we ought to follow. Calmet.—God would not exhort us so earnestly to pray, unless he was ready to grant our petitions. Let us blush at our sloth: he is more ready to give than we are to receive. S. Austin.  
**8** After our Saviour had given his apostles this form of prayer, knowing that men would recite it with remissness and negligence, and then on account of not being heard, would desist, he teaches here to avoid this pusillanimity in prayer; perseverance in our petitions being the most advantageous. S. Cyril, ex Divo Thoma.  
**9** Our petitions are frequently not immediately granted, that our earnestness and assiduity may be increased; that we may learn to esteem the gifts of God, and preserve them with care, for whatever we procure with labour, we preserve with care, lest by losing it we lose our labour also. S. Basil in Con. Mon.  
**10** How comes it to pass then, that many pray, and receive not? To this we answer, that if they approach in a proper manner, and observe the necessary conditions of the petition, they will undoubtedly receive what they ask for; but if, on the contrary, they deviate from this rule, and ask not, as they ought, they will not receive; because as S. James says, *you ask, and receive not, because you ask amiss.* Chap. i. By asking for things that are prejudical to your well-being; or, if for spiritual blessings, you do not receive them, on account of your evil motives. Origen ex S. Thoma.  
**14** This possessed person is said in S. Matthew to have been also blind. Upon him, therefore, were wrought three wonders: the blind saw, the dumb spoke, the possessed was delivered; which daily takes place in the persons of such as are converted to the number of true believers: the devil is expelled, and they both receive the light of faith beaming upon their eyes, and having the strings of their silent organs loosed to sound forth the praises of God. Ven. Bede.—*And* *the multitude*, &c. The multitude, though devoid of learning, were constant admirers of the actions of our Lord, whilst the Scribes and Pharisees either denied them, or by a sinister interpretation, ascribed them to the power of the unclean spirit. Ven. Bede.  
**17** *And house upon house shall fall.* He speaks of a house or family divided, which thereby shall fall to ruin. Wi.  
**19** *Your judges* *.* They will condemn you of injustice, envy, and hatred against me, and blasphemy against God; because when they perform any exorcisms, though they appear but little more than human in their actions, yet you ascribe them to the virtue of God; but when I perform any miracle, though there always appear most evident signs of the power and virtue of God, you ascribe all to the hand and machinations of the devil. Tirinus.  
**24** *Man*, &c. By this one man is meant the whole Jewish people, out of whom the unclean spirit had been driven by the law. S. Ambrose.—For as long as they were in Egypt, they lived after the manners of the Egyptians, and were the habitation of the unclean spirit; but it was expelled from them, when they slew the paschal lamb in figure of Christ, and escaped destruction by sprinkling themselves with its blood. S. Cyril ex Divo Thoma.—But the evil spirit returned to his former habitation, the Jews, because he saw them devoid of virtue, barren, and open for his reception. And their latter state is worse than their former; for more wicked demons possessed the breasts of the Jews than before. Then they raged against the prophets only; but now they persecute the Lord himself of the prophets: therefore have they suffered much greater extremities from Vespasian and Titus, than from Egypt and Babylon; for besides being deprived of the merciful protection of Providence, which before watched over them, they are destitute of all grace, and delivered up to a more poignant misery, and a more cruel tyranny of the devil. S. Chrys. hom. xliv on S. Matt.  
**26** *The last sta* *te*, &c. But these words are also addressed to us Christians, who may often, and with reason, fear lest the vice we think extinguished in us, again return and seize on our slothful and careless souls, finding them cleansed indeed from the filth of sin by the grace of baptism, but destitute of every ornamental and protective virtue. It brings with it seven other evil spirits, by which we must understand every vicious inclination. V. Bede.—The latter state of these souls is worse than the former; because having been delivered from all former sins, and adorned with grace, if they again return to their iniquities a much more grievous punishment will be due for every subsequent crime. S. Chrys. hom. xliv on S. Matt.  
**28** Μενουνγε, imo vero, yes indeed. Our Saviour does not here wish to deny what the woman had said, but rather to confirm it: indeed how could he deny, as Calvin impiously maintained, that his mother was blessed? By these words, he only wishes to tell his auditors what great advantage they might obtain by attending to his words. For the blessed Virgin, as S. Augustine says, was more happy in having our Saviour in her heart and affections, than in having conceived him in her womb. Tirinus.  
**29** *But the sign of Jonas.* Instead of a prodigy in the heavens or in the air, I will give you one in the bosom of the earth, more wonderful than that of the prophet Jonas, who came out alive from the belly of the fish, which had swallowed him. Thus I will return alive from the bosom of the earth three days after my death. Calmet.—He gave them a sign, not from heaven, for they were unworthy to behold it, but from the deep; the sign of his incarnation, not of his divinity; of his passion, not of his glory. V. Bede.  
**31** *Queen of the South* shall condemn this generation, not by exercising the power of judgment against them, but by having performed an action which, when put in competition with theirs, will be found superior to them. V. Bede.  
**34** *If thy eye be si* *ngle.* As when the eyes of the body are pure, and free from the mixture of bad humours, the whole body is lightsome; so if the eyes of the mind, viz. reason, faith and understanding, are not infected with the pestiferous humours of envy, avarice, and other vices, the whole mind will be illuminated by the presence of the Holy Ghost. Take care, therefore, lest by giving way to these vices, the light which is in thee be turned into darkness. Barradius.  
**36** *The whole shall be lightsome.* Not only all thy body, but all about thee; all thy ways and actions. Wi.  
**38** *Washed*, &c. There was nothing ordained by the law concerning this washing of the hands, which the Pharisees observed before taking meat. Christ and his apostles washed their hands when they pleased, without looking for any mystery in such things, or making to themselves vain obligations in frivolous and indifferent things. They did not neglect what was ordained by the law in certain cases for purification; but beside that, they observed nothing more. Calmet.  
**41** *But yet that which remaineth, give alms.* [1] The sense seems not to be of *what remaineth*, give alms, as some expound it; but by the Greek, the sense is, *gi* *ve alms of what you have*, i.e. of your goods, according to your abilities; and as Toby said to his son, *If thou hast much, give much; if little, give a little willingly.* Tob. 4:9.—*All things are clean* *unto you.* Not that alms without other pious dispositions, will suffice to your salvation; but that other necessary virtues will be given you, by the mercies of God. Wi.—These are the means I propose to you to gain that interior purity I am speaking of. But will alms suffice to expiate all sorts of crimes? Is it enough for the murderer, the homicide, &c. to give alms? Undoubtedly not. Our Saviour only compares alms-deeds with the exterior washing which the Pharisees affected. As if he had said, “It is not by the washing in common water that you will take out the stains of your souls, but by the works of charity. Charity will be more efficacious to cleanse you than all the waters of the rivers and of the sea.” Or, according to Euthymius, if you wish to cleanse yourselves truly, bring forth worthy fruits of penance, give up ill acquired possessions; and as for the rest, redeem you sins by alms. Thus shall all things be made clean to you, as well within as without the vase. Calmet.  
**43** **3** **.** *Salutations in the market-place*, &c. Such as wish to be saluted, and have the first places, that they may appear great, are likened to sepulchres, which are covered externally with ornaments, but are filled inwardly with rottenness. S. Cyril ex D. Thoma.  
**44** *Sepulchres that appear not.* This comparison is partly different from that of Matt. 23:27. For there Christ compares hypocrites to *whi* *tened sepulchres*, which may be seen and avoided; here he compares them to sepulchres covered with grass, which appear not: yet the comparison, in the main, is the same; that whether they appear or not, still under them is corruption: as the interior of the Pharisees was always full of vice and corruption. Wi.—*Men that walk*, &c. Because they bear with them a fair outside, but are made up of nothing but corruption. S. Ambrose.  
**45** *Then one of the lawyers*, &c. Correction, which turns to the advantage of the meek, appears always more intolerable to the wicked. Christ denounces woes against the Pharisees for deviating from the right path, and the doctors of the law found them equally applicable to themselves. S. Cyril ex D. Thoma.—How miserable is the conscience which, upon hearing the word of God, thinks itself insulted, and always hears the punishment of the reprobate rehearsed as the words of its own condemnation. Ven. Bede.  
**47** *Wo to you who build*, &c. Not that the building of the monuments of the prophets was in itself blameworthy, but only the intention of these unhappy men, who made use of this outward shew of religion and piety, as a means to carry on their wicked designs against the prince of prophets. Ch.  
**48** *Build*, &c. See the notes Matt. 23:29. Wi.  
**49** *The wisdom of God said.* In S. Matt. it is, Behold I send to you prophets and wise men; and in this passage of S. Luke, the wisdom of God saith, I will send, &c.: thus is Christ truly the wisdom of the Almighty God. S. Ambrose.  
**51** *Blood of Zacharias*, &c. This Zacharias was, according to some Zacharias the son of Joiada, whom the Jews slew between the temple and the altar. Theophylactus,—also S. Jerom, who moreover mentions that some editions had Zacharias, son of Joiada.—*This generation.* Not that this generation of the Jews should be punished for the crimes of others, but that having before their eyes the severe chastisements their ancestors had received, in punishment of their wickedness, they had not grown better, but had imitated their perversity. S. Chrys. hom. lxxv in Matt.  
**52** *You have taken away the key of knowledge.* A comparison of a master that locks others out. As if Christ said: you pretend, as masters and teachers, to open and expound the law and the prophets; and by your false doctrine and interpretations, you neither observe the law, nor permit others to observe it. See Matt. 23:13. Wi.—The key of knowledge is faith; for by faith we come to the knowledge of truth, according to that of Isaiah, How shall they understand, if they have not believed? Cap. 7, (according to Septuagint) these doctors of the law took away the key of science, by not allowing the people to believe in Christ. S. Cyril ex D. Thoma.  
**53** *And to oppress* (i.e. stop) *his mouth abou* *t many things.* [2] This is the literal signification of the Greek: they started one question upon another, to raise confusion and confound the answers. Wi.

## Chapter 12

**1** *Beware ye of the* leaven, &c. Christ calls the hypocrisy of the Pharisees heaven, which changes and corrupts the best intentions of men; for nothing is more destructive than hypocrisy to such as give way to it. Theophylact.  
**3** *House-tops.* Our divine Saviour speaks here according to the custom of his own nation, where it was not uncommon for men to preach from the house-top, when they wished to deliver any thing to the public; for their houses had flat roofs. Ven. Bede.  
**8** *Whosoever shall confess me.* By these words we are informed, that more than bare inward protestations of fidelity will be demanded of us; for he moreover requires an exterior confession of our faith. S. Ambrose.  
**13** *The inheritance.* This man might think, that Jesus being the Messias, would act like a king and a judge. Wi.—*Speak to my brother*, &c. See in this the spirit of this world, at the very time Jesus is teaching disinterestedness, and the contempt of riches, he is interrupted by a man, who begs him to interfere in a temporal concern: deaf to every thing else, this man can think of his temporal interest only. Calmet.—He begged half an inheritance on earth; the Lord offered him a whole one in heaven: he gave him more than he asked for. S. Aug.  
**14** *Judge*, &c. Our Saviour does not here mean to say that he or his Church had not authority to judge, as the Anabaptists foolishly pretend; for he was appointed by his Father, the King of kings, and the Lord and Judge of all. He only wished to keep himself as much detached as possible from worldly concerns: 1. Not to favour the opinion of the carnal Jews, who expected a powerful king for the Messias. 2. To shew that the ecclesiastical ministry was entirely distinct from political government, and that he and his ministers were sent not to take care of earthly kingdoms, but to seek after and prepare men for a heavenly inheritance. S. Ambrose, Euthymius, Ven. Bede.  
**19** *Much goods*, &c. It is evident how far this poor man was mistaken, when he called these things goods, which with more reason ought to be esteemed evils. The only things that can rightly be called goods, are humility, modesty, and its other attendants. The opposite to these ought to be esteemed evils; and riches we ought to consider as indifferent. S. Chrys.  
**22** *Therefore I say to you*, &c. Our Lord proceeds step by step in his discourse, to inculcate more perfect virtue. He had before exhorted us to guard ourselves against the fatal rocks of avarice, and then subjoined the parable of the rich man; thereby insinuating what folly that man is guilty of, who applies all his thoughts solely to the amassing of riches. He next proceeds to inform us that we should not be solicitous even for the necessities of life: wishing by this discourse to eradicate our wicked propensity to avarice. Theophy.  
**29** *And be not lifted up on high.* [1] S. Aug. (l. ii. QQ. Evang. q. 29. t. 3, part 4, p. 257.) expounds it thus: do not value yourselves for the plenty and variety you have of things to eat. Others, by the Greek, look upon it as a metaphor, taken from *meteors* in the air, that appear high, and as it were in suspense whether to remain there or to fall down; so that they expound it: be not distracted and disturbed with various thoughts and cares how to live. Wi.  
**32** Christ styles the elect in this place, his little flock, on account of the greater number of the reprobate; or rather through his love of humility, because though the Church be most numerous, yet he wishes it to continue in humility to the end of the world, and by humility to arrive at the reward which he has promised to the humble. Therefore, in order to console us in our labours, he commands us to seek only the kingdom of heaven, and promises us that the Father will bestow it as a reward upon us. Ven. Bede.  
**33** Be not solicitous that whilst you are fighting for the kingdom of heaven, the necessities of this life will be wanting to you, on account of his command. Sell what you possess, that you may bestow charity; which those do, who having left all things, nevertheless labour with their hands for their livelihood, and to bestow the rest in charity. Ven. Bede.  
**35** *Let your loins be girded;* i.e. be prepared to walk in the way of virtue; a comparison taken from the custom of the eastern people, who girded up their long garments, when they went about any business. Wi.—After our divine Saviour had given his disciples such excellent instructions, he wishes to lead them still farther in the path of perfection, by telling them to keep their loins girt, and to be prepared to obey the orders of their divine Master. By lamps burning in their hands he wished to insinuate, that they were not to pass their lives in obscurity, but to let their lights shine before men. Theophy.  
**38** In the first watch is childhood, the beginning of our existence, and by the second is understood manhood, and by the third is meant old age. He, therefore, who does not comply with our divine Master’s injunctions in the first or second watch, let him be careful not to lose his soul by neglecting to be converted to God in his old age. S. Greg. in S. Tho. Aquin.  
**39** Some have imagined that the devil, our implacable enemy, is designated by the thief, and our souls by the house, and man by the householder: yet this interpretation does not agree with what follows; for the coming of our Lord is compared to the thief, as if surprising us on a sudden. This latter opinion, therefore, seems to be the more probable one. Theophylactus.  
**48** *Shall be beat* *en with few stripes.* Ignorance, when it proceeds from a person’s own fault, doth not excuse, but only diminisheth the fault. Wi.  
**49** *I am come to send fire on the earth.* By this *fire*, some understand the light of the gospel, and the fire of charity and divine love. Others, the fire of trials and persecutions. Wi.—What is the fire, which Christ comes to send upon the earth? Some understand it of the Holy Ghost, of the doctrine of the gospel, and the preaching of the apostles, which has filled the world with fervour and light, and which was signified by the flames of fire which appeared at the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the apostles. My words, says the Lord, in Jeremias, (C. 23:29) are as a fire, and as a hammer, that breaketh the rock in pieces. Others understand it of the fire of charity, which Christ came to enkindle upon the earth, and which the apostles carried throughout the whole world. But the most simple and literal opinion seems to be, the fire of persecution and war. Fire is often used in Scripture for war: and our Saviour declares in S. Matt. that he is come to bring the sword, and not peace; that is, the doctrine of the gospel shall cause divisions, and bring persecutions, and almost an infinity of other evils, upon those who shall embrace and maintain it. But it is by these means that heaven must be acquired, it is thus that Jesus Christ destroys the reign of Satan, and overturns idolatry, superstition, and error, in the world. So great a change could not be made without noise, tumult, fire, and war. Calmet.  
**50** *I am to be baptized*, with troubles and sufferings.—*And how am I straitened?* &c. not with fear, but with an earnest desire of suffering. Wi.  
**54** In these words he reproaches them, that they knew well enough how to judge of the weather by the appearance of the heavens; but were ignorant how to distinguish the times: i.e. could not discern that the time marked by the prophets, for the coming of the Messias, was accomplished. In Palestine, the Mediterranean Sea, which was to the west, was accustomed to send clouds and rain; and the south winds, which came from Arabia and Egypt, very warm countries, caused dryness and heat. Calmet.

## Chapter 13

**1** *Whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.* These seem to have been some of the seditious followers of Judas, the Galilean, or *Gaulonite*, who denied that God’s people were to pay taxes; and it is thought that some of them, coming to offer up sacrifices in the temple, Pilate caused them to be slain at that very time, so that their blood was mixed with the sacrifices. Wi.—*W* *hose blood*, &c. i.e. whom he had caused to be massacred in the temple, at the time they were offering sacrifices. The history, to which allusion is made in this place, in not well known; but there is great probability that these Galileans were disciples of Judas, the Galilean, who taught that they ought not to pay tribute to foreigners. As they were spreading this doctrine in Jerusalem, and perhaps even in the temple, Pilate laid violent hands upon them, and caused them to be murdered amidst the sacrifices. Calmet.—*Galileans*, &c. These were the followers of one Judas, a Galilean, of whom S. Luke makes mention in the Acts of the Apostles, (C. 5) who held it unlawful to call any one *lord.* Many of this sect were punished by Pilate, because they would not allow this title to be given to Cæsar; they also maintained that no other sacrifices could lawfully be offered, except such as were prescribed by the law, by which opinion they forbade the accustomed sacrifices offered up for the emperor and people of Rome. Pilate, irritated by these their opinions, ordered them to be slain in the midst of their sacrifices, and this was their blood mixed with that of the victims. Cyril ex D. Thoma.  
**2** **Ve** **r.** **2** **.** *Sinners*, &c. People are naturally inclined to believe, that those who are unfortunate, and afflicted with calamities, must likewise be culpable and impious. The Jews were very much given to these sentiments, as we see in many places of Scripture; John 9:2 and 3. Our Saviour wishes to do away with this prejudice, by telling them that the Galileans, who are here spoken of, were not the most culpable among the inhabitants of that country; shewing by this, that God often spares the most wicked, and sends upon the good the most apparent signs of vengeance, that he may exercise the patience, and crown the merit of the latter, and give to the former an example of the severity which they must expect, if they continue in their disorders. Neither can it be said, that in this God commits any injustice. He uses his absolute dominion over his creatures, when he afflicts the just; he procures them real good, when he strikes them; and his indulgence towards the wicked, is generally an effect of his mercy, which waits for their repentance, or sometimes the consequences of his great anger, when he abandons them to the hardness of their reprobate hearts, and says, “I will rest, and be angry with you no longer.” Ezechiel, C. 16:42. This is the most terrible mark of his final fury. Calmet.  
**3** This prediction of our Saviour upon the impenitent was afterwards completely verified; for Josephus informs us, that under the government of Cumanus, 20,000 of them were destroyed about the temple. Antiq. lib. xx, c. 4. That upon the admission of the Idumeans into the city, 8,500 of the high priest’s party were slain, insomuch that there *was a flood of blood quite round the temple.* De Bello Jud. lib. iv, c. 7. That in consequence of the threefold faction that happened in Jerusalem before the siege of the Romans, the temple was *every where polluted with slaughter;* the priests were slain in the exercise of their functions; many who came *to worship, fell before their sacrifices; the dead b* *odies of strangers and natives were promiscuously heaped together, and the altar defiled with their blood.* De Bel. Jud. lib. vi, c. 1. That upon the Romans taking possession of the city and temple, *mo* *untains of dead bodies were piled up about the altar; streams of blood ran down the steps of the temple;* several were destroyed by the *fall of towers*, and others suffocated in the ruins of the galleries over the porches. De Bel. Jud. lib. vii, c. 10.  
**4** *Or those eighteen*, &c. The Almighty permitted these people to be thus chastised, that the others might be filled with fear and apprehension at the sight of another’s dangers, and thus become the heirs of the kingdom of heaven. But then you will say, is another punished that I may become better? No; he is punished for his own crimes; but his punishment becomes to those that witness it the means of salvation. S. Chrys. Concio. 3. de Lazaro.  
**5** *Unless you do penance*, &c. The Jews did not penance; and therefore, forty years after our Lord’s Passion, the Romans came, and beginning with Galilee, destroyed this impious nation to its roots, and polluted not only the court of the temple, whither the sacrifices were carried, but the inner sanctuary, with human blood. Ven. Bede.  
**6** *A certain man*, &c. Each one, inasmuch as he holds a place in life, if he produce not the fruit of good works, like a barren tree encumbers the ground; because the place he holds, were it occupied by others, might be a place of fertility. S. Gregory.  
**9** *And if happily it bear fruit.* It is a way of speaking, when a sentence is left imperfect; yet what is not expressed, may be easily understood; as here we may understand, *well* and *good*, or the like. Wi.  
**14** The president of the synagogue, when he saw the woman, who before crept on the ground, now raised by the touch of Christ, and hearing the mandate of God, was filled with envy, and decried the miracle, apparently through solicitude for keeping the sabbath. But the truth is, he would rather see the poor woman bent to the earth like a beast, than see Christ glorified by healing her. S. Cyril ex D Thoma Aquin.  
**19** Our Lord was this mustard-seed, when he was buried in the earth; and He became a tree, when he ascended into heaven; but a tree that overshadowed the whole creation, in the branches of which the birds of heaven rested; that is, the powers of heaven, and all such as by good works have raised themselves from the earth. The apostles are the branches, to repose in whose bosoms we take our flight, borne on the wings of Christian virtue. Let us sow this seed (Christ) in the garden of our hearts, that the grace of good works may flourish, and you may send forth the various perfumes of every virtue. S. Amb.  
**21** The flour represents us Christians, who receive the Lord Jesus into the inner parts of our soul, till we are all inflamed with the fire of his heavenly wisdom. S. Ambrose.  
**24** *Shall seek*, &c. Shall desire to be saved; but for want of taking sufficient pains, and not being thoroughly in earnest, shall not attain to it. Ch.—Our Lord answers here in the affirmative: viz. that the number of those who are saved, is very small, for a few only can enter by the narrow gate. Therefore does he say, according to S. Matthew, (C. 7) Narrow is the way that leadeth to life, and few there are that enter therein. This does not contradict what is said in the 8th chapter of S. Matthew: That many shall come from the east, and sit down in the kingdom of God; for many indeed shall join the blessed company of the angels, but when considered with the number of the slain, they will appear but few. S. Aust. ser. xxxii. de Verb. Dei.  
**25** When the Almighty casts any off, he is said not to know them: in the same manner as a lover of truth may be said not to know how to tell a falsehood, being withheld powerfully from it by his love of truth. S. Greg. mor. c. 8.  
**26** These words are addressed particularly to the Jews, because Christ was born of them according to the flesh, eat and drank with them, and taught publicly in their streets; but they apply to us Christians also, for we eat the body of Christ, and drink his blood, when each day we approach the mystical table, and we hear him teaching us in the streets of our souls. Theophylactus.—Many very fervent at the beginning afterwards grow lukewarm; and many, though at first frozen, have suddenly glowed with virtue; many, who in this world were contemned, have received glory in the next; while others, in honour amongst men, have passed to eternal torments. Ven. Bede.  
**32** It is rather surprising that Christ should make use of these opprobrious words, which could be of no service to himself, but which would only serve to irritate king Herod, should they come to his ears. But Christ, by these words, probably wished to shew that he was not the least afraid of him whom the Pharisees feigned to have a design on his life: for it is supposed that the Pharisees had invented this fiction, in order to compel him to leave them quiet. Maldonatus.  
**33** *Nevertheless I must walk*, (i.e. labour in the mission, teaching, &c.) *to-day, and to-morrow*, &c. i.e. for a while.—*It canno* *t be that a prophet*, [1] &c. Not that all the prophets suffered in Jerusalem, though many did; and it is rather to prophesy, that he himself, the great Prophet, and their Messias, should be put to death at Jerusalem. Wi.

## Chapter 14

**1** This was the Hebrew expression for taking a meal; their frugality probably suggested this method of expression, bread being the principal part of their repast. Calmet.—What a contrast here between the actions of the Pharisees and those of our Saviour! They watched all his actions, in order to have an opportunity of accusing him, and of putting him to death; whilst he, on the contrary, seeks after nothing but the salvation of his enemies’ souls. Tirin.  
**2** Our divine Saviour, regardless of the wicked designs which these Pharisees meditated to destroy him, cures the sick man, who did not dare to ask the favour of him, for fear of the Pharisees. He could only persuade himself to stand in his presence, hoping that Christ would at length cast a compassionate look upon him: who being well pleased with him, did not demand of him if he wished to be cured, but without demur proceeded to work this stupendous miracle in his behalf. S. Cyril.—In which Christ did not so much consider whether the action would give scandal to the Pharisees, as whether it would afford the sick man comfort; intimating, that we ought ever to disregard the raillery of the fools, and the scandal which men of this world may take at our actions, as often as they are for the honour of God, and the good of our neighbour. Theophy.  
**3** *Is it lawful?* Jesus knew their thoughts, and that they would blame him as a sabbath-breaker: yet he healed the man, and confounded them by the example and common practice of pulling an ass out of a pit on the sabbath-day. Wi.  
**5** By this example Christ convicts his adversaries, as guilty of sordid avarice, since, in delivering beasts from the danger of perishing on the sabbath-day, they consult only their own advantage, whilst he was only employed in an act of charity towards his neighbour; an action they seemed so warmly to condemn. Ven. Bede.  
**7** *A parable.* What parable? In the text there is no parable, but only instruction. Maldonatus thinks that our Saviour spoke a parable on this occasion, which S. Luke has omitted, giving us only the moral and the substance of the instruction conveyed by it. Calmet.—To take the lowest place at a feast, according to our Saviour’s injunctions, is certainly very becoming; but imperiously to insist upon it, is far from acting according to our Saviour’s wishes, particularly when it is destructive of regularity, and productive of discord and contention. S. Basil.  
**9** *The lowest place.* A person of the first quality is not to do this literally, which would be preposterous; but it is to teach every on humility of heart and mind. Wi.  
**12** Christ does not here forbid the invitation of friends and relatives, since that would be acting directly contrary to his own maxims and spirit, which breathe nothing but charity and union. He merely wishes to purify our motives in the disposal of our charity, by insinuating that there is more merit in giving to the indigent, from whom we can expect no remuneration. Calmet.—It is only an effect of avarice, to be liberal to those who will repay us, says S. Ambrose. It is our duty as acknowledged even by heathens (Cicero de Off. l. i.) to assist those who stand most in need of it; but our practice says the same author, is to be most obsequious to those from whom we expect most, though they want our services the least. S. Ambrose, Ven. Bede, and S. Chrys. are of the same opinion.  
**16** By this man we are to understand Christ Jesus, the great mediator between God and man. He sent his servants, at supper-time, to say to them that were invited, that they should come; i.e. he sent his apostles to call the people of Israel, who had been invited to his supper on almost innumerable occasions: but they not only refused the invitation, but also murdered the Lord who had invited them. We may remark, that the three different excuses exactly agree with what S. John says: All that is in the world is the concupiscence of the flesh, and concupiscence of the eyes, and the pride of life. The one says, *I have married a wife*, by which may be understood the concupiscence of the flesh; another says, *I have bought five yoke of oxen*, by which is denoted the concupiscence of the eyes; and the pride of life is signified by the purchase of the *farm*, which the third alleges in his justification. S. Aug. de verb. Dei.  
**23** *Compel them to come in.* This is almost the only expression in the New Testament, which can give to the intolerant a plea for persecution. The spirit of the gospel is the spirit of mildness, and the compulsion which it authorizes to bring infidels or heretics into the Church, is such as we use towards our friends, when we press them to accept of our hospitality. The great pope, S. Gregory, forbade the Jews to be persecuted in Rome, who refused to receive the faith of Christ. “That is a new and unheard of kind of preaching,” says he, “which demands assent by stripes.” A.  
**26** *Hate not*, &c. The law of Christ does not allow us to *hate* even our enemies, much less our parents: but the meaning of the text is, that we must be in that disposition of soul so as to be willing to renounce and part with every thing, how near or dear soever it may be to us, that would keep us from following Christ. Ch.—The word *hate* is not to be taken in its proper sense, but to be expounded by the words of Christ, (Matt. 10:37) that no man must love his *father more than God*, &c. Wi.—Christ wishes to shew us what dispositions are necessary in him who desires to become his disciple; (Theophy.) and to teach us that we must not be discouraged, if we meet with many hardships and labours in our journey to our heavenly country. S. Gregory.—And if for our sakes, Christ even renounced his own mother, saying, *Who is my mother, and who are m* *y brethren?* why do you wish to be treated more delicately than your Lord? S. Ambrose.—He wished also to demonstrate to us, that the hatred he here inculcates, is not to proceed from any disaffection towards our parents, but from charity for ourselves; for immediately he adds, *and his own life also.* From which words it is evident, that in our love we must hate our brethren as we do ourselves.  
**28** *For which of you*, &c. The similitude, which our divine Saviour makes us of, represents the offices and duty of a true Christian, for he has to build within himself and conduct others by his example to war with the devil, the world, and the flesh; and he has to season, purify, and keep all his actions free from corruption by the spiritual salt of mortification and prayer. Tirinus.  
**29** *Lest* *after*, &c. Here he wishes to shew us, that we are not to embrace any state of life, particularly that of an ecclesiastic, without previous and serious consideration, whether we shall be able to go through with the difficulties and dangers which will inevitably befall us: lest afterwards we find ourselves constrained to yield to our enemies, who will deride us, and say: *This man began* to build, and was not able to finish. Tirinus.  
**34** *But if the salt*, &c. Man, after he has once been illumined with the light of faith, should he be so unfortunate as to fall into the sink of his former evil habits, what remedy is there remaining for him? He is, as our Saviour says, neither profitable for the land nor for the dunghill, but shall be cast out. Luke 14:35. Ven. Bede.

## Chapter 15

**4** *What man*, &c. Christ left the ninety-nine in the desert, when he descended from the angelic choirs, in order to seek last man on the earth, that he might fill up the number of the sheepfold of heaven, from which his sins had excluded him. S. Amb.—Neither did his affection for the last sheep make him behave cruelly to the rest; for he left them in safety, under the protection of his omnipotent hand. S. Cyril de D. Thoma Aquin.  
**7** *Joy in heaven*, &c. What incitement ought it not to be to us to practise virtue, when we reflect that our conversion causes joy to the troops of blessed spirits, whose protection we should always seek, and whose presence we should always revere. S. Amb.—There is greater joy for the conversion of a sinner, than for the perseverance of the just; but it frequently happens, that these being free from the chain of sin, remain indeed in the path of justice, but press not on eagerly to their heavenly country; whilst such as have been sinners, are stung with grief at the remembrance of their former transgressions, and calling to mind how they have forsaken their God, endeavour by present fervour to compensate for their past misconduct. But it must be remembered that there are many just, whose lives cause such joy to the heavenly court, that all the penitential exercises of sinners cannot be preferred before them. S. Gregory, hom. xxxiv.  
**8** In the preceding parable, the race of mankind is compared to a lost sheep, to teach us that we are the creatures of the most high God, who made us, and not we ourselves, of whose pasture we are the sheep. Ps. 99. And in this parable mankind are compared to the drachma, which was lost, to shew us that we have been made to the royal likeness and image even of the omnipotent God; for the drachma is a piece of money, bearing the image of the king. S. Chrysos. in S. Tho. Aquin.  
**10** *Before the angels.* By this it is plain that the spirits in heaven have a concern for us below, and a joy at our repentance, and consequently a knowledge of it. Ch.  
**11** *A certain man had two sons.* By the elder son is commonly expounded the Jewish people, who for a long time had been chosen to serve God; and by the *younger son*, the Gentiles, who for so many ages had run blindly on in their idolatry and vices. Wi.—Some understand this of the Jews and Gentiles, others of the just and sinners. The former opinion seems preferable. The elder son, brought up in his father’s house, &c. represents the Jews; the younger prodigal is a figure of the Gentiles. Calmet.  
**12** It is very probable, from this verse, that the children of the family, when come to age, could demand of their parents the share of property which would fall to their lot. For these parables suppose the ordinary practices of the country, and are founded on what was customarily done. Grotius thinks this was the common law among the Phœnicians.—The Gentiles, prefigured by the prodigal son, received from their father, (the Almighty,) free-will, reason, mind, health, natural knowledge, and the goods which are common to mankind, all which they dissipated and abused. Sinners who have besides received the gift of faith and sanctification, by baptism, and who have profaned the holiness of their state, by crimes, are more express figures of the bad conduct of this son. Calmet.  
**16** *Husks.* This expresses the extreme misery of his condition. There is no need of seeking any other mystery in this word. Horace, by a kind of hyperbole, (B. ii, Ep. 1.) represents the miser as living upon husks to be able to save more.  
**18** How merciful is the Almighty, who, though so much offended, still does not disdain the name of father.—*I have sinned.* These are the first words of a sinner’s confession to the author of nature. God knows all things; still does he expect to hear the voice of your confession. It is in vain to think of concealing your sins from the eyes of him whom nothing can escape; and there can be no danger of acknowledging to him what his infinite knowledge has already embraced. Confess then that Christ may intercede for you, the Church pray for you, the people pour forth their tears for you. Fear not that you cannot obtain pardon, for pardon is promised to you; grace, and a reconciliation with a most tender parent, are held out to you. S. Ambrose.—*Before thee*, &c. By this does our Redeemer shew, that the Almighty is here to be understood by the name of father: for the all-seeing eye of God only beholds all things, from whom even the secret machinations of the heart cannot be concealed. S. Chrys. ex D. Tho.  
**22** *The first;* i.e. the best *robe* *:* by it, is meant the habit of grace. Wi.  
**24** *Was dead, and is come to life again.* A sinner, in mortal sin, is deprived of the divine grace, which is the spiritual life of the soul. At his conversion it is restored to him, and he begins to live again. Wi.  
**25** *His elder son*, &c. We have already remarked, that this son represents the Jews. He boasts of having always served his father faithfully, and of never disobeying him. This is the language of that presumptuous people, who believe themselves alone holy; and despising the Gentiles with sovereign contempt, could not bear to see the gates of salvation laid open also to them. The 28th, 29th, and 30th verses express admirably the genius of the Jewish people; particularly his refusing to enter his father’s house, shews their obstinacy. Calmet.  
**29** *I have never transgressed*, &c. With what face could the Jews, represented here by the eldest son, say they have never transgressed the commandments of their father? This made Tertullian think that this was not the expression of the Jews, but of the faithful Christians; and, therefore, he interprets the whole parable as applied to a disciple of Christ. But we should recollect, that it is not uncommon for presumption to boast of what it never has done. The whole history of the Jews is full of numberless details of their prevarication and disobedience. Calmet.—*A kid*, &c. The Jews demanded a kid, but the Christians a lamb; therefore was Barabbas set at liberty for them, whilst for us the lamb was immolated. S. Amb.

## Chapter 16

**1** *There was a certain rich man*, &c. By this parable, our Saviour advises his disciples to accompany their penitential works with deeds of mercy to the poor. Ven. Bede.—There is a certain erroneous opinion, that obtains pretty generally amongst mankind, and which tends to increase crimes, and to lessen good works: and this is, the foolish persuasion that men are not accountable to any one, and that we can dispose as we please of the things in our possession. S. Chrys.—Whereas we are here informed, that we are only the dispensers of another’s property, viz. God’s. S. Amb.—When, therefore, we employ it not according to the will of our Master, but fritter and squander it away in pleasure, and in the gratification of our passions, we are, beyond all doubt, unjust stewards. Theophylactus.—And a strict account will be required of what we have thus dissipated, by our common Lord and Master. If then we are only stewards of that which we possess, let us cast from our minds that mean superciliousness and pride which the outward splendour of riches is so apt to inspire; and let us put on the humility, the modesty of stewards, knowing well that to whom much is given, much will be required. Abundance of riches makes not a man great, but the dispensing them according to the will and intention of his employer. A.—The intention of this parable, is to shew what use each one ought to make of the goods which God has committed to his charge. In the three former parables, addressed to the murmuring Scribes and Pharisees, our Saviour shews with what goodness he seeks the salvation and conversion of a sinner; in this, he teaches how the sinner, when converted, ought to correspond to his vocation, and preserve with great care the inestimable blessing of innocence. Calmet.—*A stewar* *d*, &c. The parable puts us in mind, that let men be ever so rich or powerful in this world, God is still their master; they are his servants, and must be accountable to him how they have managed his gifts and favours; that is, all things they have had in this world. Wi.  
**2** *And he called him*, &c. Such are the words which our Lord daily addresses to us. We daily see persons equally healthy, and likely to live as ourselves, suddenly summoned by death, to give an account of their stewardship. Happy summons to the faithful servant, who has reason to hope in his faithful administration. Not so to the unfaithful steward, whose pursuits are earthly: death to him is terrible indeed, and his exit is filled with sorrow. All thunder-stricken at these words, “now thou canst be steward no longer,” he says within himself, what shall I do! Ex D. Thoma.  
**8** *And the lord commanded*, &c. By this we are given to understand, that if the lord of this unjust steward could commend him for his worldly prudence, though it were an overt act of injustice; how much more will the Almighty be pleased with those who, obedient to his command, seek to redeem their sins by alms-deeds? Ex D. Thoma.—“Give alms out of thy substance,” says holy Toby to his son, “and turn not thy face from any poor person: for so it shall come to pass, that the face of the Lord shall not be turned from thee. According to thy abilities be merciful. If thou hast much, give abundantly; if thou hast little, take care, even of that little, to bestow willingly a little. For thus thou storest up to thyself a good reward, for the day of necessity. For alms deliver from sin, and from death, and will not suffer the soul to go into darkness.” Tob. 4:7, 8, &c. Ibidem.—*Children of this world*, &c. are more prudent and circumspect as to what regards their temporal concerns, than they who profess themselves servants of God, are about the concerns of eternity.—*Commended the unjust steward.* [1] Lit. the *steward of iniquity:* not for his cheating and injustice, but for his contrivances in favour of himself.—*In their generation;* i.e. in their concerns of this life. They apply themselves with greater care and pains, in their temporal affairs, than the *children of light*, whom God has favoured with the light of faith, do to gain heaven. Wi.  
**9** *Make for yourselves friends*, &c. Not that we are authorized to wrong our neighbour, to give to the poor: evil is never to be done, that good may come from it. D. Thoma.—But we are exhorted to make the poor our friends before God, by relieving them with the riches which justly indeed belong to us, but are called *the mammon of iniquity*, because only the iniquitous man esteems them as riches, on which he sets his affections; whilst the riches of the virtuous are wholly celestial and spiritual. S. Aug. de quæst. Evang.—*Of the mammon of iniquity.* Mammon is a Syriac word for riches; and so it might be translated, *of the riches of iniquity.* Riches are called *unjust*, and riches of *i* *niquity*, not of themselves, but because they are many times the occasion of unjust dealings, and of all kind of vices. Wi.—*Mammon* signifies *riches.* They are here called the *mammon of iniquity*, because oftentimes ill-gotten, ill-bestowed, or an occasion of evil; and at the best are but worldly, and false: and not the true riches of a Christian.—*They may receive.* By this we see, that the poor servants of God, whom we have relieved by our alms, may hereafter, by their intercession, bring our souls to heaven. Ch.—They may receive you into their eternal tabernacles. What a beautiful thought this! What a consolation to the rich man, when the term of his mortal existence is approaching, to think he shall have as many advocates to plead for his admittance into the eternal mansions of rest, as he has made friends among the poor by relieving their temporal wants. The rich give to the poor earthly treasures, the latter return in recompense eternal and infinite happiness. Hence we must infer, that the advantage is all on the side of the giver; according to the saying of our Lord, happier is the condition of him who gives, than of him who receives. A.  
**10** *He that is faithful in that which* *is least.* This seems to have been a common saying, and that men judged of the honesty of their servants by their fidelity in lesser matters. For example, a master that sees his servant will not steal a little thing, judges that he will not steal a greater, &c.—*And he that is unjust in that which is little, is unjust also in that which is greater.* The interpreters take notice, that here *temporal* goods are called *little*, and *spiritual* goods are called *greater;* so that the sense is, that such men as do not make a right use of their temporal goods, in the service of God, will not make a good use of spiritual graces as they ought to do. See Maldonatus. Wi.  
**11** *If then you have not been faithful in the unjust mammon;* [2] i.e. in fading and false riches, which are the occasion of unjust and wicked proceedings.—*Who will trust you with that which is the true?* i.e. God will not intrust you with the true and spiritual riches of his grace. Wi.  
**12** *And if you have not been faithful in that* *which is another’s:* so again is called false worldly wealth, which passeth from one to another; so that it cannot be called a man’s own, *who will give you that which is your own?* i.e. how can you hope that God will bestow upon you, or commit to your care, spiritual riches or gifts, which, when rightly managed, would by your own for all eternity? See S. Aug. l. ii. qq. Evang. q. 35. p. 263. Wi.—*Th* *at which is another’s.* Temporal riches may be said to belong to another, because they are the Lord’s; and we have only the dispensing of them: so that when we give alms, we are liberal of another’s goods. But if we are not liberal in giving what is another’s, how shall we be so in giving our own? Nothing one would have thought so properly belonged to the Jews, as the kingdom of heaven, the preaching of the gospel, and the knowledge of heavenly things. But they were deprived of all for their infidelity in the observance of the law, which was first intrusted to them. Calmet.  
**13** *No servant* *can serve two masters*, &c. This is added to shew us, that to dispose of our riches according to the will of the Almighty, it is necessary to keep our minds free from all attachment to them. Theophylactus.—Let the avaricious man here learn, that to be a lover of riches, is to be an enemy of Christ. Ven. Bede.  
**14** *Now the Pharisees*, &c. Christ had admonished the Scribes and Pharisees not to presume too much on their own sanctity, but to receive repenting sinners, and to redeem their own sins with alms. But they derided these precepts of mercy and humility; either because they esteemed what he commanded them to be useless, or because they thought they had already complied with them. Ven. Bede.—The Pharisees considered temporal riches as true goods, and the recompense which God had promised to such as observed his laws; they therefore laughed at the doctrine of Jesus Christ, which extolled liberality and alms-deeds, and despised the Master who, on all occasions, testified his great regard for poverty in his discourses, in his conduct, in the choice of his apostles, who were all poor, and had no pretensions whatever to exterior pomp or show. Calmet.  
**15** *Who justify yourselves*, &c. But our Lord, detecting their hidden malice, shews that their pretended justice is all hypocrisy. Theophylactus.—*But God knoweth*, &c. They justify themselves before men, whom they look upon as despicable, and abandoned sinners, and esteem themselves as not standing in need of giving alms as a remedy of sin; but he who shall lay open the secrets of hearts, sees the *base* atrocity of that pride which thus blinds them, and swells within their breasts. Ven. Bede.—Yes, all those exterior actions which appeared great, and which were admired by men, being vitiated with improper motives and sinister designs, are an abomination in the sight of God. A.  
**16** *The law and the prophets*, &c. Not that the law was made void by the coming of John, but that what the law and the prophets had taught, had been suited to the very imperfect dispositions of the Jews, who as yet were incapable of relishing perfect virtue. At the coming of John, the gospel began to be preached, and this called men to a life of perfect sanctity. S. Tho. Aquin.—Our Saviour came not to destroy, but to fulfil the law and the prophets. Matt. 5:17.  
**19** *There was a certain rich man*, &c. By this history of the rich man and Lazarus, he declares that those who are placed in affluent circumstances, draw upon themselves a sentence of condemnation, if seeing their neighbour in want, they neglect to succour him. S. Cyril, in Cat. Græc. patrum.—He that hath the substance of this world, and shall see his brother in need, and shut up his bowels against him, how doth the charity of God abide in him? John, 1 Ep. 3:17. A received tradition of the Jews informs us, that this *Lazarus* was a beggar, then at Jerusalem, suffering in the most wretched condition of poverty, and infirmity: him our Saviour introduces, to manifest more plainly the truth of what he had been saying S. Cyril, ut supra.—By this, we are not to understand that all poverty is holy, and the possession of riches criminal; but, as luxury is the disgrace of riches, so holiness of life is the ornament of poverty. S. Ambrose.—A man may be reserved and modest in the midst of riches and honours, as he may be proud and avaricious in the obscurity of a poor and wretched life.—Divers interpreters have looked upon this as a true history; but what is said of the rich man *seeing* Lazarus, of his *tongue*, of his *finger*, cannot be literal: souls having no such parts. Wi.—In this parable, which S. Ambrose takes to be a real fact, we have the name of the poor mendicant; but our Lord suppresses the name of the rich man, to signify that his name is blotted out of the book of life: besides, the rich man tells Abraham, that he has five brothers, who were probably still living; wherefore, to save their honour, our Lord named not their reprobated brother.  
**22** *Abraham’s bosom.* [3] The place of rest, where the souls of the saints resided, till Christ had opened heaven by his death. Ch.—It was an ancient tradition of the Jews, that the souls of the just were conducted by angels into paradise. The bosom of Abraham (the common Father of all the faithful) was the place where the souls of the saints, and departed patriarchs, waited the arrival of their Deliverer. It was thither the Jesus went after his death; as it is said in the Creed, *“he descended into hell,”* to deliver those who were detained there, and who might at Christ’s ascension enter into heaven. Calmet. See 1 Pet. 3:19.—“Many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham.” Matt. 8:11.  
**25** It appears from Philo, (de Execrat. p. 9, 37 b.) that the Jews not only acknowledged the existence of souls, and their state of happiness or misery after this life, but also that the souls of the saints and patriarchs interceded with God for their descendants, and obtained from them the succour they stood in need of. Calmet.  
**26** *Between us and you is fixed a great chaos*, or gulf; i.e. God’s justice has decreed, that the bad should forever be separated from the good. We may here take notice that the Latin and Greek word, (v. 22) translated *hell*, even in the Prot. translation, cannot signify only the *grave.* Wi.  
**27** In this parable we are taught an important truth, viz. that we must not expect to learn our duty from the dead returning to life, nor by any other extraordinary or miraculous means, but from the revelation of truths, which have already been made known to us in the Scriptures, and from those to whom the tradition of the Church has been committed, as a most sacred deposit. These, say the Fathers, are the masters from whom we are to learn what we are to believe, and what to practise. Calmet.  
**31** *If they hear not, Moses*, &c. We think that if we saw a man raised from the dead, who should tells us what he had seen and suffered in another world, it would make more impression upon us than past miracles, which we hear of, or the promises and threats of the prophets, apostles, and our blessed Saviour, which are contained in Scripture; but it is a false notion, a vain excuse. The wicked, and unbelievers, would even in that case find pretexts and objections for not believing. S. Chrys. hom. iv.—They would say that the dead man was a phantom; that his resurrection was not real; his assertions nugatory. When Christ raised Lazarus from the dead, the miracle was known, evident and public; yet we find none of the Pharisees converted by it. They were even so mad as to enter into a design to kill Lazarus, to get rid of a witness who deposed against their incredulity. How many other miracles did he not perform in their sight, which they attributed to the prince of darkness, or to magic? Christ raised himself from the dead. This fact was attested by many unexceptionable witnesses. And what do the hardened Jews do? They object, that his disciples, stealing away the body, maliciously persuaded the people that he had risen again. Such is the corruption of the human heart, that when once delivered up to any passion, nothing can move it. Every day we see or hear of malefactors publicly executed, yet their example has no effect on the survivors, nor does it prevent the commission of fresh crimes. Calmet.—“We have also the more firm prophetical word; whereunto you do well to attend, as to a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts.” 2 Pet. 1:19.—We may learn many very instructive lessons from this affecting history of Lazarus.—*The rich* may learn the dreadful consequences to be apprehended from riches, when made subservient to *sensuality, luxury*, and *ambition.* The *po* *or* may learn to make their poverty and sufferings, however grievous to nature, instrumental to their future happiness, by bearing them with patience and resignation to the will of heaven. The former are taught that to expose a man to eternal misery, nothing more is required than to enjoy all the *good things* of this world according to their own will; the latter, that however they may be despised and rejected of men, they may still have courage, knowing that the short day of this fleeting life, with all its apparent evils, will soon be over; and that the day of eternity is fast approaching, when every one shall receive according as he has done good or evil in his body. A.

## Chapter 17

**1** The world being corrupted as it is, and the spread of evil so wide, it is impossible that scandals should not come. V.—*It is impossible*, morally speaking, with regard to the malice of men. Wi.  
**2** *It were better.* Christ here speaks after the manner of the Jews, who were accustomed to inflict this punishment only on the greatest malefactors. So that we must be ready to undergo the most excruciating torments, rather than cause any scandal to our neighbour; though we must here observe, that if our neighbour take scandal at our good works, we ought not on that account to desist from doing good, or desert the truth. Ven. Bede.—S. Luke, in this chapter, inserts four instructions, which have no connection with each other, and which by the writers of evangelical harmony, are given in different places; as in Matt. 18 after v. 14, &c.  
**5** *Increase our faith.* The disciples having heard our Saviour inculcating maxims hard to flesh and blood, such as avoiding scandal, and forgiving our enemies, humbly beg their faith may be increased, that they may be able to comply with these maxims; for they had heard Christ say, that every thing was possible to him that believed. Theophy.—Christ compares faith to a grain of mustard seed; because, though the grain be small, it is nevertheless stronger than most herbs. S. Chrysos.  
**6** *To this mulberry-tree.* In S. Matthew, (17:19) we read, *to this mountain.* Christ might say both at different times. Wi.  
**7** The design and end of this parable is to shew that, rigorously speaking, we are useless servants with regard to God. This sovereign Master has a right to exact of us every kind of service, and to make us apply ourselves to any task he may think proper, without our having any reason to complain either of the difficulty, trouble, or length of our labours; we are entirely his, and he is master of our persons, time, and talents. We hold of him whatever we possess, and wo to us if we abuse his trust, by applying our talents to any use contrary to his designs. But though he be Lord and Master, he leaves our liberty entire. If he produces in us holy desires, if he works in us meritorious actions, gives us virtuous inclinations and supernatural gifts, he sets to our account the good use we make of them; and in crowning our merits, he crowns his own gifts. S. Aug. lib. ix. Confes. and Serm. 131. Calmet.  
**10** *Unprofitable servants.* Because our service is of *no profit* to our Master; and he justly claims it as our bounden duty. But though we are *unprofitable to him*, our serving him is not *unprofitable to us;* for he is pleased to give, by his grace, a value to our good works, which, in consequence of his promise, entitles them to an eternal reward. Ch.—The word *useless*, when joined to servant, generally means a servant from whom his master does not derive the service he has a right to expect; as in S. Matt. 25:30. Here the word is taken in a less odious sense. It means a servant who does not testify sufficient zeal and ardour in his master’s service, who is not very eager to please him. With regard to God, we are always useless servants, because he wants not our services; and without his assistance, we can neither undertake nor finish any thing to please him. Calmet.  
**14** *To the priests.* Jesus sends them to the priests, to convince the latter of the reality of the cures which he wrought, and oblige them by that to acknowledge him for their Messias; 2ndly, that the lepers might enjoy the fruit of their cure, by returning to the society of their fellow men, after they had been declared clean, and satisfied all the demands of the law; for there were may ceremonies previous to be gone through. Calmet.—And lastly, to shew that in the new law, such as are defiled with the leprosy of sin, should apply to the priests. Hence, says S. Austin, let no one despise God’s ordinance, saying that it is sufficient to confess to God alone. Lib. de visit. infirm.  
**19** *Thy faith hath made thee* *whole.* Were not the others also made whole? They were cleansed indeed from their leprosy, but it no where appears that they were justified in their souls like this Samaritan, of whom it said, thy faith hath made thee whole; whereas it was said of the others, that they were made clean, viz. of their leprosy in their body, though not justified in their soul: this the Samaritan alone seems to have obtained. Maldonatus.  
**20** *When the kingdom of God should come?* or when is it to come? when will the Messias come? The Pharisees might say this in a mocking and an insulting manner, to signify that he could not be their true Messias.—*The kingdom of God cometh not with observation;* that it, so as to be observed; not with great marks of temporal power, as you imagine. Wi.—The Pharisees expected a Messias powerful according to this world, a conqueror, a monarch, a revenger of the injuries of Israel; one who would restore them to liberty, and bless them with temporal goods and prosperity. In Jesus, they saw nothing, which corresponded to these magnificent hopes; and therefore asked him, by way of insult and reproach, when this kingdom of God would come, which he so often talked of and announced to his disciples. He answers them, that the manifestation of the Messias, and the establishment of his kingdom, shall not be effected in a conspicuous, splendid manner. It shall be brought about insensibly, and the accomplishment of the designs of the omnipotence of our Lord shall appear a casualty, and the effect of secondary causes. You shall not see the Messias coming at the head of armies, to spread terror and desolation. His arrival shall not be announced by ambassadors, &c. every thing in the establishment of my kingdom shall be the reverse of temporal power. Calmet.  
**21** *Is with* *in you.* It is with you; your Messias is already come.—*He standeth in the midst of you*, as John the Baptist told you. John 1:26. Wi.  
**22** *To see one day*, &c. Hereafter, when I shall be no longer visibly among you, you shall heartily wish for one day’s conversation with me. Wi.—This verse is addressed to the disciples. He insinuates that he will take from them this corporeal presence, and they shall be exposed to persecution and affliction: then they shall wish to see one day of the Son of man, and shall not be able to obtain it. They shall wish ardently to see him, to entertain themselves with him, and consult him, but shall not have that happiness. This was meant to excite the disciples to profit more of his presence whilst they enjoyed it. Calmet.  
**24** *For as the lightning*, &c. See Matt. 24:27. Wi.—Christ here alludes to the glory with which he shall appear when he shall come to judge the world, surrounded by his angels, &c. when he will appear like lightning, that shall penetrate the inmost recesses of our souls, and shall suffer no crime, not even the slightest thought of our souls, to pass unnoticed. This is the time when he will manifest his glory, and not on his entry into Jerusalem, as the disciples imagined: for he informs them, that he will then have to suffer a cruel death. Ven. Bede.  
**27** After having compared his second coming to lightning, in order to shew how sudden it will be, he next compares it to the days of Noe and Lot, to shew that it will come when men least expect it; when, entirely forgetting his coming, they are solely occupied in the affairs of this world, in buying and selling, &c. He only mentions those faults which appear trivial, or rather none at all, (passing over the crimes of murder, theft, &c.) purposely to shew, that if God thus punishes merely the immoderate use of what is lawful, how will his vengeance fall upon what is in itself unlawful. Ven. Bede.  
**31** When you see war lighted up in Judea, lose no time, but betake yourselves to flight for safety. Indeed the Christians, forewarned by these predictions, and other prophecies of the apostles, according to Lactantius, (lib. iv. c. 21.) fled from the danger beyond the Jordan, into the states of Herod, to Pella and the neighbouring villages. See Eusebius. Eccles. Hist. lib. iii. c. 5.  
**32** As Lot only escaped destruction by leaving all things, and flying immediately to the mountain, whereas his wife, by shewing an affection for the things she had left, and looking back, perished; so those who, in the time of tribulation, forgetting the reward that awaits them in heaven, look back to the pleasures of this world, which the wicked enjoy, are sure to perish. S. Ambrose.—Τα οπισω επιλανθανεσθαι, τοις δε εμπροσθεν επεκτεινεσθαι. Philip. 3:13.  
**34** By these different examples, Christ wishes to insinuate that good and bad men will be found in every state of life. By those in bed, are understood the rich, by those in the mill, are understood the poor; whilst those in the field designate the pastors of his flock, who are labouring in the vineyard of the Lord. S. Cyril and S. Amb.  
**37** To the question of his disciples in the preceding verse, our blessed Saviour only returns this enigmatical answer, which seems to mean, that where-ever there are guilty Jews, there shall their enemies pursue them and find them out, not only in Jerusalem, but in all the cities of Judea, Galilee, &c. every where the vengeance of the Lord shall follow them, and overtake them. For the interpretation of other parts of this chapter, see S. Matt. c. 24. Calmet.—If we observe some discrepancies between the precise words of our Lord, as given by S. Matt. and S. Luke, as in S. Matt. c. 24 v. 40, and in Luke 17:34, and alibi passim, we can reconcile those apparent variations, by supposing that our Lord, in the course of his conversation, made use of both expressions. A.

## Chapter 18

**1** *Always to pray*, i.e. to pray daily, and frequently; ( Wi.) and also to walk always in the presence of God, by a spirit of prayer, love, and sorrow for sin.  
**2** This judge, who feared not God, nor cared for man, yet yielded to the importunity of the widow, represents the absolute and sovereign power of God. But we must not suppose the Almighty has any of the faults we see in this iniquitous judge. Comparisons are not meant to hold good in every particular. The only consequence to be drawn from the present parable, is this: if a man, who has neither piety nor tenderness for his fellow creatures, yield to the importunity of a widow, who is not wearied out with repeating her petitions; how much more will God, who is full of bounty and tenderness to man, and only seek occasions to grant him his gifts, hear the prayers of the fervent, and fill with benedictions the petitioner, who can continue like the widow to importune his interference, and can beg without languor or discouragement? Calmet.  
**3** *Avenge me;* i.e. do me justice. It is a Hebraism. Wi.  
**4** *And he would not for a long time.* The Almighty does not always hear us as soon as we could wish, nor in the manner that seems best to us; but if we are not always heard according to our desires, we always are as far as is conducive to our salvation. He sometimes delays, in order to exercise our patience, and increase our ardour: sometimes he grants, in his anger, what, in him mercy, he would refuse. Let us then pray always, desire always, love always. Desire always, and you pray always. This is the continual voice of prayer, which the Almighty demands of you. You are silent, when you cease to love. The cooling of charity, is the silence of the heart. S. Aug. in Ps. xxxvii. Wi.  
**5** *She weary me out* *.* [1] This, as much as I am able to find out, seems the literal signification both of the Latin and Greek text. Wi.  
**8** In the Greek, although he suffer for the present the elect to be oppressed. V.—Our divine Redeemer adds, this, to shew that *faith* must necessarily accompany our prayers. For whosoever prays for what he does not believe he shall obtain, will pray in vain; let us, therefore, entreat the Father of mercies to grant us the grace of prayer, and firmness in faith; for faith produces prayer, and prayer produces firmness of faith. S. Aug. de verb. Dom. Serm 36.—But of this there is little left on the earth, and there will be still less at the second coming of the Son of God.  
**9** In this chapter we have three examples of prayer: one of the persevering widow; another of the poor publican, who solicits the divine mercy by the acknowledgment of his crimes; and the third of the proud Pharisee, who only goes to the temple to pronounce his own panegyric, and enter upon a accusation of his humble neighbour, whose heart is unknown to him. Calmet.  
**11** The Pharisee *standing.* The Greek is, standing by himself, i.e. separated from the rest. Some understand this term, *standi* *ng*, as if in opposition to *kneeling* or *prostrating*, which they suppose to be the general posture in which the Jews offered up their prayers, and that of the humble publican. The Christians borrowed this practice from them. We see the apostles and disciples praying on their knees: Acts 7:59, 9:40, 20:36. In the Old Testament, we see the same observed. Solomon, (3 K. 8:54) Daniel, (6:10) and Micheas, (6:6) prayed in that posture. Others however, think that the people generally prayed standing, as there were neither benches nor chairs in the temple. Calmet.—There are four ways by which men are guilty of pride: 1st, By thinking they have any good from themselves; 2nd, by thinking that though they have received it from above, it was given them as due to their own merits; 3rd, by boasting of the good they do not possess; and fourthly, by desiring to be thought the only persons that possess the good qualities of which they thus pride themselves. The pride of the Pharisee seems to have consisted in attributing to himself alone the qualities of which he boasted. S. Greg. mor. l. xxiii, c. 4.—He who is guilty of publicly speaking against his neighbour, is likewise the cause of much damage to himself and others. 1st, He injures the hearer; because if he be a sinner, he rejoices to find an accomplice; if he be just, he is tempted to vanity, seeing himself exempt from the crimes with which others are charged. 2nd, He injures the Church, by exposing it to be insulted for the defects of its members. 3rd, He causes the name of God to be blasphemed; for, as God is glorified by our good actions, so is he dishonoured by sin. 4th, He renders himself guilty, by disclosing that which it was his duty not to have mentioned. S. Chrys. Serm. de Phar. et Pub.  
**12** See how the Pharisee here, by pride, lays open to the enemy his heart, which he had in vain shut against him by fasting and prayer. It is in vain to defend a city, if you leave the enemy a single passage, by which he may enter in. S. Greg. mor. l. xix. c. 12.  
**14** If any one should ask why the Pharisee is here condemned for speaking some few words in his own commendation, and why the like sentence was not passed on Job, who praised himself much more; the difference is evident: the former praised himself without any necessity, merely with an intention of indulging his vanity, and extolling himself over the poor publican; the latter, being overwhelmed with misery, and upbraided by his friends, as if, forsaken of God, he suffered his present distress in punishment of his crimes, justifies himself by recounting his virtues for the greater glory of God, and to preserve himself and others in the steady practice of virtue, under similar temptations. Theophylactus.  
**34** They understood well enough the sense of the words he spoke to them. But they could not understand how they could be reconciled with the idea they had previously conceived of the Messias. They were scandalized in the first place, to think that God should suffer any thing inflicted by man; they were scandalized in the second place, to hear that sufferings and death could lead to victory and empire; and lastly, they were scandalized, (their own feelings taking the alarm) lest they should be forced to imitate their Master in this part which he had chosen for himself. A.  
**35** This blind man is, according to some interpreters, different from the other two whom Jesus Christ cured as he was going out of Jericho. V.—See Matt. 20:29 and Mark 10:46 et dein.

## Chapter 19

**2** What sinner can despair when he sees the Saviour of mankind seeking to save him; when he beholds even a publican and a rich man, at the same time, who, as our Saviour informs us in another place, are so seldom truly converted, brought to the light of faith, and the grace of a true conversion! S. Ambrose.—Zacheus (who as a farmer of the customs, not a collector, as some falsely imagine) immediately hearkened to the interior voice of the Almighty, calling him to repentance; he made no delay, and therefore deserved immediately not only to see, but to eat, drink, and converse with Jesus. S. Cyril.—Behold here the three steps of his conversion: 1. an ardent desire of seeing Jesus; 2. the honourable reception he gave him in his house; 3. the complete restitution of all ill-acquired property.  
**9** Zacheus is here styled a son of Abraham; i.e. his spiritual son, a partaker of the promises made to Abraham concerning the Messias: not that he was actually born of his seed, but because he imitated his faith; and as Abraham at the voice of God, left the land and house of his father; so Zacheus renounced his goods and possessions, by giving them to the poor. Ven. Bede.  
**11** *That the kingdom of God should immediately be manifested.* The disciples were full of the expectation of the temporal kingdom of the Messias, though he had divers times told them he was to suffer and die on a cross. Wi.—Notwithstanding all that Jesus had said to them about his kingdom, his death, his consummation, and resurrection, they still believed that the kingdom of God was going to be manifested, and that Jesus, in this journey, would make himself be acknowledged king by the whole nation of the Jews. They could not lay aside the ideas they had formed of the personal and temporal reign of the Messias. Every thing which they could not reconcile with this standard, was completely impenetrable to them. It was a language they could not comprehend. Calmet.  
**12** This parable is an exact prophetic history of what happened to Archelaus Antipas, son of Herod the great, about thirty-six years afterwards. Judea being then tributary, he was obliged to go to Rome to receive his kingdom from the hands of the emperor Augustus. The Jews, who hated him for his cruelty, sent an embassy to the emperor, to accuse him of many crimes, and disappoint him in his hopes of gaining his crown. But Augustus confirmed it to him, and sent him back to reign in Judea, where he revenged himself on those who had opposed his pretensions. With regard to the instruction, which is meant to be conveyed by this parable; this nobleman is the Son of God, who came among the Jews to take possession of the kingdom, which was his due. But being rejected and treated unworthily, and even put to a disgraceful death on the cross, he will one day come again, armed with vengeance, and inflict the effects of his anger upon them. This was partly fulfilled at the destruction of Jerusalem, and will be completed at the general judgment. Calmet. V.  
**13** *Ten* pieces of money, each of which was called a *mna.* To translate *pounds*, gives the English reader a false notion, the Roman coin called a *mna* not corresponding to our pound. Wi.—A *mna* was 12½ ounces, which, at five shillings per ounce, is £3 2s. 6d.  
**19** All the disciples of Christ have not the same degree of honour in this world, nor in the next; because all do not make an equal use of the graces they receive. Some are in the first rank, as apostles; then those, to whom the gift of prophecy has been committed; then doctors, &c. each exalted according to his merit. For there are many mansions, and many degrees of glory, in the house of the heavenly Father. Calmet.—For there is one brightness of the sun, another of the moon, and another of the stars; for star differeth from star in brightness. 1 Cor. 15:41.  
**34** It may here be asked, how the owners of the colt knew who *the Lord* was, of whom the disciples spoke? It may be answered, that perhaps they had already heard that Jesus of Nazareth, who the Jews thought was to be their temporal king, was coming about that time to Jerusalem, and that they saw from their dress, or other external marks, that they were the disciples of Jesus. Dionysius.  
**40** *The stones.* This is a proverb, as if he had said: God has resolved to glorify me this day, in order to fulfil the prophecies. Nothing can hinder the execution of his decrees; if men were silent, he would make even the stones to speak. Calmet.—At the crucifixion of our Redeemer, when his friends were silent through fear, the very stones and rocks spoke in his defence. Immediately after he expired, the earth was moved, the rocks split, and the monuments of the dead opened. V. Bede.—Nor is it any wonder if, contrary to nature, the rocks bespeak the praises of the Lord, since he was even praised by a multitude, much more insensible than the rocks themselves, in crucifying him only a few days after, whom they now salute with Hosannahs of joy. S. Ambrose.  
**41** *He wept.* S. Epiphanius tells us, that some of the orthodox of his time, offended at these words, omitted them in their copies, as if to shed tears, were a weakness unworthy of Christ: but this true reading of the evangelist is found in all copies, and received by all the faithful; and the liberty which those who changed them took, was too dangerous ever to be approved of by the Church. Neither do these tears argue in Jesus Christ any thing unworthy of his supreme majesty or wisdom. Our Saviour possessed all the human passions, but not the defects of them. The Stoics, who condemned the passions in their sages, laboured to make statues or automata of man, not philosophers. The true philosopher moderates and *governs* his passions; the Stoic labours to *destro* *y* them, but cannot effect his purpose. And when he labours to overcome one passion, he is forced to have recourse to another for help. Calmet.—Our Saviour is said to have wept six times, during his life on earth: 1st, At his birth, according to many holy doctors; 2ndly, at his circumcision, according to S. Bernard and others; 3rdly, when he raised Lazarus to life, as is related in S. John, c. 11; 4thly, in his entry into Jerusalem, described in this place; 5thly, during his agony in the garden, just before his apprehension, when, as S. Luke remarks, (C. 22) *his sweat was as drops of blood tric* *kling down upon the ground;* and 6thly, during his passion, when he often wept, on account of his great distress of mind, occasioned principally by the knowledge he had of the grievousness of men’s sins, and the bad use they would make of the redemption he was, through so many sufferings, procuring for them. Dionysius.  
**42** *If thou also hadst known.* It is a broken sentence, as it were in a transport of grief; and we may understand, *thou wouldst also weep.* Didst thou know, even *at this day*, that *peace* and reconciliation which God still offers to thee. Wi.—What can be more tender than the apostrophe here made use of by our Saviour! *Hadst thou but known*, &c. that is, didst thou but know how severe a punishment is about to be inflicted upon thee, for the numberless transgressions of thy people, thou likewise wouldst weep; but, alas! hardened in iniquity, thou still rejoicest, ignorant of the punishment hanging over thy head. Just men have daily occasion to bewail, like our blessed Redeemer, the blindness of the wicked, unable to see, through their own perversity, the miserable state of their souls, and the imminent danger they are every moment exposed to, of losing themselves for ever. Of these, Solomon cries out; (Prov. 2:13) *They leave the right way, and walk through dark ways.* We ought to imitate this compassion of our blessed Redeemer; and, as he wept over the calamities of the unfortunate Jerusalem, though determined on his destruction; so we ought to bewail the sins not only of our friends, but likewise of our enemies, and daily offer up our prayers for their conversion. D. Dionysius.  
**43** *And compass thee*, &c. Christ’s prophecy is a literal description of what happened to Jerusalem, under Titus. Wi.  
**48** *All the people*, as they heard him with so great attention. So Virgil said:

## Chapter 20

**1** *In one of the days.* This happened on the last week (on the Tuesday) two or three days before Christ suffered. See the contents of this chapter, Matt. 21 and 22 and Mark 11 and 12. Wi.—Jesus Christ begins with stating the wide difference between the state of things in this mortal life and in that which is to come: that marriage necessary here, will be unnecessary hereafter. For, in this life, they are children of men, subject to death, and therefore under the necessity of continuing their race by generation; but in the next life, they shall be *children of resurrection*, living for eternity, never to die, and consequently sons of God, and immortal. Resurrection is a kind of regeneration to immortality. Hence S. Paul explains to our Saviour’s rising again, these words of the 2nd Psalm: *Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.* Calmet.  
**39** The Scribes, seeing the Sadducees thus silenced, seemed to side entirely with our Saviour saying: Master, thou hast said well. And, apprehensive of being exposed to a similar disgrace and discomfiture themselves, they were afraid to ask him any more questions. But this was only an apparent and false conformity; for they afterwards procured him to be put to death by the Romans. Thus mortal hatred or envy may indeed be smothered for a time, but can hardly ever be extinguished. Theophylactus.  
**44** Christ indeed is both the Lord and Servant of David. He is Servant, according to the flesh, being a descendant of David; and he is Lord, according to the spirit, being Lord of all. S. Chrys.—We hear in our times of a new sect of Pharisees, who neither believe that Christ is the true Son of God, nor that he is God born of a pure virgin. To such we object this question: How is he the Son of David, and his Lord? Not by human, but by divine dominion. S. Cyril.—He has two natures: the nature of man, according to which, David was his father; and the nature of God, according to which, he was Son of God, and Lord of David. Thus is the difficulty solved.  
**45** How forcible are our divine Redeemer’s reasonings, when he uses any text out of the prophets. When he performs the most stupendous miracles, his enemies generally have something to reply; when he cites a text of Scripture, they have nothing to say. All are silent. S. Chrys.  
**46** The reproach he makes the Scribes in this place, is similar to what he had objected against the Pharisees. S. Matt. 23:5. Both these sects were filled with the same spirit of pride and vanity, which shewed itself in their dress, in their exterior, and in every part of their conduct. If our Saviour here attacks them upon their long trains, or other affected forms of their dress, he does not pronounce an absolute condemnation of things, which in themselves are indifferent, but of their abuse of them, making them serve only the purpose of vanity and affectation. Calmet.  
**47** These shall receive a greater condemnation, because they not only commit ordinary evil actions, but also make their prayers, and virtue itself, a cloak to their hypocrisy and vanity, and the cause of their greater depravity, famishing the widows whom themselves ought to compassionate and relieve. Theophylactus.—Or, the greater honours and rewards they received for their wickedness, the greater punishment must they endure to expiate it. Ven. Bede.—Jesus Christ seems in this place to allude to the avaricious practice of the Jews, draining the purses of widows by their stipulated long prayers for their departed husbands, (see Matt. 23:14. Mark 12:40) and thus abusing so holy a thing as prayer, merely to gratify their avarice.…

## Chapter 21

**3** Whatever we offer to the Almighty with a good intention is acceptable to him; for he regards not the gift, but the heart of the giver. Ven. Bede.—God does not appreciate the smallness of the gift, but the greatness of the affection with which it is offered. S. Chrys. hom. i. ad Hebræos.  
**6** It was by the divine dispensation of Providence that this city and temple were destroyed; for had the ancient rites and sacrifices continued, some that were but weak in their faith, might have been filled with astonishment at the sight of these different modes of worship, existing at the same time, and thus have been lead astray from the path of truth. Ven. Bede.  
**7** *Master, when shall these things be?* &c. See the annotations, Matt. 24:3. Wi.  
**8** *In my name.* They shall not say that they belong to me, or that I sent them: but they shall take to themselves my name, viz. Christ, or Messias, which title is incommunicable to any but myself. In effect, in less than two centuries, there appeared many false Christs and impostors, who pretended to be the one that was to come, the desired of nations. Calmet.—Perhaps this prophecy is yet to be more expressly fulfilled before the dissolution of the world. Many pious and learned Christians suppose this passage to refer to the time of Antichrist. A.  
**11** *Terrors from heaven.* Josephus, in his history of this war, in which Jerusalem was destroyed by Titus, (lib. vii, c. 12) relates, at length, many of the prodigies which were the forerunners of the dreadful end of this unfortunate city. During a whole year a meteor, like a flaming sword, was seen impending over the city. There were likewise seen in the air, appearances of chariots and numerous armies, which pressed one upon another. On the night of Pentecost, the priests, after a confused noise, heard distinctly these words, “Let us go hence;” which are supposed to have been spoken by the angels, who had hitherto guarded and protected the holy city, but now were taking their leave of it. Josephus was in the Roman camp, before the city, during the siege, and an eye-witness of what passed on the occasion. A.  
**12** This verse is spoken to the apostles alone; and was verified, by most of them having been martyred and put to death, before the destruction of Jerusalem. Calmet.  
**15** *I will give*, &c. In some parts it is said, that Christ himself will speak by the mouths of his disciples, as in this passage of S. Luke; in other places, as S. Matt. C. 16 that the Father will speak; and S. Matt. C. 10 that the Spirit of the Father will speak. In these different texts there is no contradiction, but a most perfect harmony. What one of the divine Persons says, all three say; for the voice of the Trinity is only one. S. Ambrose.  
**18** *A hair of your hea* *d*, &c. A hair shall not perish from the head of the disciples of Christ; because not only their most heroic actions, and their public confessions of his name, but even their passing thoughts shall be crowned with adequate rewards. Ven. Bede.  
**19** *In your patience*, &c. We then truly possess our souls, when we live in all things perfect, and from the citadel of virtue command and control all the motions of the mind and heart. S. Greg. Mag. Moral. v. c. 13.  
**22** *Days of vengeance*, &c. These are truly the days of vengeance; days, that will arise to punish this people for having spilt the blood of the Lord. Ven. Bede.  
**24** Whoever reads Josephus’s history of the calamities which befell Jerusalem before its destruction, will find none of these terrible menaces unfulfilled. Seventy thousand were carried away captives in this war. After the soldiers were weary of killing, Titus ordered the finest of the young men to be kept to adorn his triumph. The number of captive Jews was so great in Rome, as to make the heathen poet, Rutilius Numantianus, who lived about the year 410, complain of it as a great burden to the empire.  
**26** *The powers of heaven*, &c. Some explain this of the angels, who shall be terrified and tremble at the sight of so many calamities. Others understand it of the heavenly bodies, the sun, moon, stars, &c. which shall in some sort, likewise, be confused in the general dissolution. The prophets often make use of such expressions, when speaking of the fall of monarchies, or the ruin of nations. *The heavens shall be astonished and moved*, &c. Ezech. 32:7. Joel 3:15. Calmet.  
**27** The Jews shall not see him corporally, but at the last judgment. Then, says the Scripture, (Zach. 12:10) *They shall see him whom they pierced* with nails. But in the ruin of Jerusalem, all who will compare his predictions with the event, can evidently see that this was the day of his coming, so plainly marked in his words. Every body could see that this was evidently the hand of God that punished them. Calmet.  
**37** *In the mount that is called Olivet.* In this last week, Christ, after preaching in the day-time in the temple, when constantly in the evenings to pray in the garden of Gethsemani, as Judas knew very well. See C. 22 v. 39. Wi.

## Chapter 22

**3** *And* Satan *entered into Judas.* The meaning only seems to be, that the devil tempted and overcame him. Wi.—Satan entered into Judas not all at once, but by degrees. He first gained possession by avarice, next by theft, and lastly he impelled him to the blackest treachery and cruel parricide. The Scripture only says that Satan had entered into him when he was entirely abandoned to iniquity, had hardened his heart against all grace, and shut his ears against every instruction of Jesus. In like manner the Scripture says of a good man, who is strengthened in grace, that the Holy Spirit dwells in him. Calmet.  
**4** Many even now shudder at the mention of the crime of Judas, and are surprised to think that he could be guilty of such ingratitude, when themselves are negligent in avoiding the like crimes. For he who breaks the law of charity and truth, betrays Christ, who is charity and truth, and does it not through any infirmity or ignorance, but designedly and maliciously. Ven. Bede.  
**15** *With desire I have desired:* lit. *with a desire have I desired.* [1] The repetition expresseth a great and earnest desire. Wi.  
**17** *Taken the chalice.* This is not the chalice of his blood, (the latter is spoken of v. 20, and 1 Cor. 11:25) but it is the cup which the master of the repast blessed with ceremony, then drank of it, and gave it to all the guests. The modern Jews still observe this custom; not only on the Pasch, but on all other great feasts. The father of the family pours wine into a cup, takes it in his right hand, elevates it, blesses it, tastes, and gives it round to the invited. Our Saviour on this occasion complies with the custom; and after supper takes the chalice, which he converts into his own blood. Calmet.  
**18** *I will not drink*, &c. i.e. from this hour of the supper, to the time of his resurrection, in which he will come in the kingdom of God, he would not taste wine. For S. Peter testifies, (Acts 10:41) that he took meat and drink after his resurrection. Ven. Bede.  
**19** THIS IS MY BODY. See the annotations on the same words of consecration, Matt. 26:26. Mark 14:22 and 1 Cor. 11:24.—*Do this for a commemoration of me.* By these words he gave a power and precept to them, and their successors, to all bishops and priests, to consecrate and offer up the same; yet so, that they are only the ministers and instruments of Jesus Christ, who instituted this sacrifice, this and all other sacraments, who is the chief and principal Priest, or offerer. It is Christ that chiefly consecrates and changes the elements of bread and wine into his own body and blood; it is he that chiefly and principally forgiveth sins in the sacraments of baptism, penance, &c. It is what S. Aug. so often repeats against the Donatists, that it is Christ that baptizeth, though the instrumental minister be a sinner or a heretic; and this is what all Catholics confess and profess.—The holy sacrifice and sacrament is to be offered and received with a devout and grateful remembrance of Christ’s benefits, and especially of his sufferings and death for all mankind. But to teach that it is a bare, though devout memorial, or *a remembrance only*, so as to exclude the *real presence* of Christ, under the outward appearances of bread and wine, is inconsistent with the constant belief and consent of all Christian churches, both of the west and east, and contradicts the plain words of Christ. The learned bishop of Meaux, in his *Exposition of the Catholic Faith*, desires all Christians to take notice, that Christ does not command them to remember him, but *to take* *his body and blood* with a remembrance of him, and his benefits: this is the import of all the words, put together. *This is my body: this is my blood:* do *this in, for*, or *with a remembrance of me.* Wi.—This sacrifice and sacrament is to be continued in the Church to the end of the world, to shew forth the death of Christ, until he cometh. But this commemoration, or remembrance, is by no means inconsistent with the real presence of his body and blood, under these sacramental veils, which represent his death; on the contrary, it is the manner that he himself hath commanded, of commemorating and celebrating his death, by offering in sacrifice, and receiving in the sacrament, that body and blood by which we were redeemed. Ch.—*Which is given*, &c. He does not say, which shall be offered for you, but which is offered; [2] because it was already a true sacrifice, in which Christ was truly present which he offered in advance to his eternal Father, before that which he was going to offer the next day, in a different manner, on the cross. This sacrifice was the consummation of the figurative Pasch, and the promise or pledge of the bloody offering, which Christ would make on the cross.… It was not the mere figure of his body, which was crucified, but the true body and the true blood. In the same manner it is both the one and the other which are given, and really present, in the Eucharist. Calmet.—To renew the memory of what I have this day done, in giving you my body; and what I shall do to-morrow, in delivering my blood and my life for the whole world, do you hereafter what you now see me do. Take bread, break it, sand say, This is my body; and it will become so really and truly, as it now is in my hands. Calmet.  
**29** *And I assign to you, as my Father hath assigned to me, a king* *dom;* i.e. as my heavenly Father decreed to exalt me, even as man, and with my human nature, above all creatures; so will I also make you, according to your different merits, partakers of my glory.  
**30** *That you may eat and drink* of the spiritual banquet of the joys of heaven which in the Scriptures are divers times compared to a feast or banquet. Wi.—*Sit upon thrones.* Judas is excepted from the dignity of this great promise. For it is probable he had gone out before the Lord spoke these words. They likewise are excepted, who (S. John 6:66) having heard the words of an incomprehensible mystery, turned back and went away. Ven. Bede.  
**31** Satan *hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.* In these words is expressed both what Satan desired, and what God permitted. Satan desired leave to tempt them, that he might make them fall from their faith in Christ. Almighty God permitted this temptation, this trial, to convince them how weak they were of themselves: he permitted their frailty to be partly overcome, yet so that rising again by his grace, they should be cleansed and purified as *wheat when it is sifted:* and that shortly after, being strengthened and confirmed by the coming of the Holy Ghost, they might become new men, enabled to stand firm against all the attacks of their greatest adversaries. Wi.  
**32** *That thy faith fail not.* The faith of Peter, established by the coming of the Holy Ghost, hath never failed, nor can fail, being built upon a rock, which is Christ himself, and being guided by the spirit of truth, as Christ promised. Jo. 15:26 and 16:13.—*And thou being once converted, confirm thy brethren*, even all the other apostles and bishops, over whom I have made and constituted thee and thy successors the chief head, that such a head being appointed by divine authority, all occasions of schisms and divisions might cease, says S. Jerom. Wi.—Admire the superabundance of the divine patience. That the disciple might not lose courage, he promised him pardon before he has committed the crime, and restores him again to his apostolic dignity, saying, *confirm thy brethren.* S. Cyril.  
**36** *That hath not*, &c. Whilst the apostles are contending for prerogative, he reminds them that now is the time of danger and slaughter; for I, your Master, (says he) shall be led to a dishonourable death, and reputed among the wicked: as all which hath been foretold of me shall have their end; that is, be fulfilled. Wishing also to insinuate the violence of the assaults they themselves will have to sustain, he mentions a sword; but does not reveal all, lest they should be too much alarmed; nor does he entirely suppress the mention of it, lest sudden attacks might overpower them, had they not been forewarned. Theophylactus.  
**38** *Behold here* *are two swords*, &c. The disciples not understanding the hidden meaning of the words in the preceding verse, and thinking they should have need of swords against the attack of the traitor Judas, say, behold here two swords. S. Cyril.—But if he had wished them to rely upon human aid, not even a hundred swords would have sufficed; but, if the power of man was unnecessary in their regard, even two swords are sufficient, and more than are wanted. S. Chrysostom.—Even two swords are sufficient testimony of our Saviour’s having suffered spontaneously. One to shew that the apostles had courage to contend for their Master, and that their Lord had the power of healing the servant, Malchus, who was maimed; the other, which was not drawn from its scabbard, shews that the apostles were withheld from doing in his defence as much as they could have done. Ven. Bede.  
**43** *An angel … strengthening him.* Christ, our Redeemer, was truly God and truly man. And being made man by a real union of his divine person and nature, to our weak and infirm human nature, he likewise took upon him our infirmities, sin excepted. We must consider him as man, when we read of his being tempted in the wilderness, (Matt. 4) when he wept at the raising of Lazarus out of the grave, (John 11) as often as we read of his praying; and here, when we read of his praying, and redoubling his prayer in the garden, when we find him seized with fear, sadness, and grief: for though, as God, he could prevent and hinder these passions and affections natural to man, yet he could also permit them to affect his human nature; as he permitted himself to be seized with hunger, after fasting forty days; and so he permitted his human nature to be seized with fear and grief in this garden of Gethsemani. As angels came and ministered to him after his fast in the wilderness, so an angel came as it were to propose to him the divine decree, that he was to suffer and die for the redemption of mankind; and as man, he is said to be strengthened and comforted by the angel: he, who as God, was Lord and maker of the angels, and so needed not to be strengthened by his creatures. Besides what happened to Christ as man, were ordained as instructions for us. We are taught by angels appearing, that they were not only ready to assist and wait upon Christ, but that, by the order of divine Providence, they are also ready to assist us in our temptations and afflictions.—*In an agony.* This Greek word signifies, a strife, or combat; not that there could be any opposition or contrariety in the interior of Christ, whose human will was always perfectly subject to his divine will, and the sensitive part to reason: yet, inasmuch as he was truly man, his human nature dreaded all those sufferings which at that time were represented to his soul, and which in a few hours he was to undergo. Wi.  
**44** *And his sweat became as drops of blood*, &c. This has sometimes happened, though in a lesser degree, to persons under extraordinary grief, if we believe Aristotle, l. iii. Animanium, c. xix. p. 891, and lib. de part. Animalium, c. v. p. 1156. Ed. Aureliæ Allobr. an 1607.—This passage of Christ’s bloody sweat, and of the apparition of the angel, was heretofore wanting in divers both Greek and Latin copies; as appears by S. Jerom, (l. ii. cont. Pelagianos. tom. iv, part 2, p. 521) and by S. Hilary, l. x. de Trin. p. 1062. Nov. Ed. It seems to have been left out by ignorant transcribers, who thought it not consistent with the dignity of Christ. But we find it in the above-said place, in S. Jerom, in S. Chrys. (hom. lxxxiv. in Matt.), in S. Aug. (in Ps. cxl. tom. iv, p. 1564, and in Psal. xciii, p. 1013.) in S. Epiphan. in Ancorato, p. 36, Ed. Petav. Wi.

## Chapter 23

**7** *He sent him away to Herod.* Pilate, in this instance, not only extricated himself from the importunities of the Jewish priests, (v. 5) but moreover obeyed the Roman law in that particular, which forbade any one to be condemned by a governor to whom he was not the subject. Theophylactus.  
**11** *And mocked him.* It is evident from the behaviour of Herod on this occasion, that he was far from believing him to be that seditious person he was represented; otherwise he would have undoubtedly treated his prisoner with less ridicule, and paid more serious attention to the accusations of his enemies. Theophylactus.—*Putting on him a white garment.* The Greek signifies not only a white, but a shining splendid robe: perhaps with some resemblance to royal garments, but at the same time through scorn and derision. Wi.  
**15** *Nothing worthy of death is done to him.* Herod has not treated him as a criminal, or one worthy of death. He only derided him as a fool: had there been any cause to punish him, he would not have failed to have done it himself, or commanded me to put him to death. Calmet.  
**16** It was a very common punishment among the Jews to scourge those who had committed crimes for which death would have been too severe. According to the laws of the Hebrews, (Deut. 25:3) the number of blows could not exceed thirty-nine. Pilate dares not condemn Jesus to death, because he believes him innocent; yet not to disoblige the people and magistrates, who demanded his death, he takes a middle way, which, as is usual in such cases, satisfies neither party. He neither saves the innocent Victim, nor satisfies justice. In lieu of one punishment, Jesus suffers two. He is at length both scourged and crucified. Calmet.  
**28** *Weep not over me.* If you knew the evils that threaten and must soon fall upon your city, upon yourselves, and upon your children, you would preserve your tears to deplore your own misfortunes. My death is for the good of mankind; but it will be fatal to your nation because you have been pleased to make it so. In the ruin of Jerusalem, which is at hand, happy shall they be who have no children. They shall save themselves the grief of seeing their sons and daughters perish miserably, and in some sort of suffering as many deaths as they have children to die. Calmet.  
**31** *In the green wood:* by which are signified persons of virtue and sanctity; as by the *dry wood*, the wicked, who bring forth no fruit, and who, like dry wood, are fit to be cast into the fire. Wi.—If they be thus cruel with me, how will they treat you!  
**33** *Called Ca* *lvary.* A place at a small distance from Jerusalem, where condemned malefactors were beheaded. So Christ, as a malefactor, dies on Calvary for the redemption of all: that where sin abounded, grace might more abound. Ven. Bede.—In this mountain, according to the Hebrew doctors, were interred the remains of our protoparent, Adam. Athana.  
**43** *I say to thee: This day thou shalt be with me in Parad* *ise;* i.e. in a place of rest with the souls of the just. The construction is not, *I say to thee this day*, &c., but, thou shalt be with me this day in the paradise. Wi.—*In paradise.* That is, in the happy state of rest, joy and peace everlasting. Christ was pleased by a special privilege, to reward the faith and confession of the penitent thief with a full discharge of all his sins, both as to the guilt and punishment, and to introduce him, immediately after death, into the happy society of the saints, whose *limbo* (that is, the place of their confinement) was now made a *paradise* by our Lord’s going thither. Ch.—The soul of the good thief was that same day with Jesus Christ, in the felicity of the saints, in Abraham’s bosom, or in heaven, where Jesus was always present by his divinity. S. Aug.—S. Cyril, of Jerusalem, says he entered heaven before all the patriarchs and prophets. S. Chrys. thinks that paradise was immediately open to him, and that he entered heaven the first mankind.—Tom. v. homil. 32.  
**51** *Arimathea.* In other parts of Scripture it is called *Ramatha*, a city of Judea, where Samuel, the prophet, was born. Ven. Bede.  
**52** *This man went to Pilate.* We may suppose that from his rank and condition in life, he had always access to Pilate.  
**54** *Parasceve* *.* That is, the eve or day of preparation for the sabbath. Ch.—*And the sabbath drew near.* Lit. *shined.* The sabbath began in the evening, at sunset. It may, perhaps, be said to shine by the moonlight, at full-moon, or because of a great many lights that used to be set up at that time, on account of the great sabbath. Wi.—We learn from Maimon, that all the Jews were so strictly bound to keep a light in their dwellings on the sabbath-day, that although a man had not bread to eat, he was expected to be from door to door, to purchase oil for his lamp. P.

## Chapter 24

**5** It is worthy of remark, that none of the disciples or friends of Christ, were so much astonished and struck at the many apparitions of angels, &c. as to be cast down to the ground, as the guards and his enemies were, but only through respect and reverential fear looked down upon the ground. Nor even did any of them fall down prostrate to adore our Saviour, when he appeared to them; because Christ was not now to be sought in the earth, among the dead, but was risen, and was to be looked for from heaven. Hence is derived the Catholic custom of praying in Pascal time, and on all Sundays, &c. not on the knee, but with the body respectfully bent, and bowing *down their countenance towards the ground.* Ven. Bede.  
**13** S. Jerom thinks the Cleophas, one of the two disciples, was a citizen of Emmaus, and that he invited Jesus to take meat in his house. His house was afterwards changed into a church, which the same Father says existed in his time. Some think Cleophas was brother to S. Joseph; others, that he was husband of Mary, sister of the blessed Virgin Mary, and father of S. James the less. Both the Latins and Greeks keep the feast of S. Cleophas, and give him the name of an apostle. Usuard says he was martyred by the Jews. Calmet.  
**16** *But their eyes were held:* either by our Saviour’s changing his features, or in what manner he pleased. Wi.  
**18** *Art thou a* *lone a stranger in Jerusalem?* or, *art thou the only stranger in Jerusalem?* which was to signify, that every one must needs have heard of what had passed in regard to Jesus. Wi.  
**21** *We hoped*, &c. as if they had lost their former hopes, or now knew not what to hope for: but perhaps, as S. Aug. observes, they might use this caution speaking before a stranger. Wi.—These two disciples were in the same error as the other Jews; who expected that the Messias would deliver them from subjection to strangers, and re-establish them in their ancient liberty. The cross and passion had been a subject of scandal and fall to them. They say, *we did hope;* as if their hopes were now at an end. What increased their diffidence was, that Christ had promised to rise again the third day, and some of the women had said that he really had risen. But they expected as public and glorious a manifestation of his resurrection, as his death had been ignominious and known to the whole world. Behold, now this is already the third day since these things are passed: if he had wished to manifest his power, he should have done it already. Thus the disciples reason, as if the third day were already past, and as if it were certain that he was not risen again. So difficult a thing is it to believe what we very ardently wish! Calmet.  
**30** The ancient Fathers think our Saviour consecrated, on this occasion, and administered the Eucharist to the two disciples. In the Acts of the Apostles, this same term, *breaking of bread*, is explained without difficulty of the Eucharist. S. Luke seems fond of this manner of expression, to signify that sacrament. Calmet.  
**37** The apostles thought they saw a Spirit, either good or bad, that had taken the form of Jesus, and was come to deceive them. For that they did not doubt spirits appeared, we have abundant proofs throughout the whole New Testament: and our Saviour, instead of combating this opinion, seems rather to have confirmed it on more than one occasion. Indeed S. Aug. thinks it cannot, without temerity, be denied, that there are occasional apparitions of angels, of demons, and the souls of the dead. Calmet.—This, however, will not justify the credulity of many ignorant and weak people, who think that nobody can die, but their spirit is sure to appear; much less will it justify the superstitious observations of unusual occurrences, which are so commonly reported to happen, as significant of a departed soul. These occurrences are rare; nor should we suppose that the Almighty would be willing to suspend or change the established laws of nature without a sufficient cause, viz. some known good either to the departed soul, or surviving friends. A.  
**39** *A spirit hath not flesh a* *nd bones, as you see me to have.* This was one argument of a true and real body. We may take notice, that Christ brought such proofs, as he knew were sufficient to convince them of his resurrection, though they were not of themselves demonstrations. For when they imagined they saw or touched a body, and that he eat with them, these things might apparently be done by a spirit. See Gen. 18 v. 9 and Gen. 19 v. 3 and v. 16 where we read that angels, in the shape of men, *eat*, and took Lot and his wife, and his daughters, *by the hand*, and led them away from Sodom. Our senses, therefore, may sometimes be deceived, as may be shewn by divers other instances. But the arguments which Christ made use of at this time, to induce the apostles to believe his resurrection, are to be taken with all the circumstances: as 1st, with the corroborating testimonies of the Holy Scriptures, in which his resurrection was foretold; 2ndly, they called to their minds what he himself had told them so often, that he would rise again the third day; 3rdly, concurred also the testimonies already given by the angels, that he was risen; 4thly, the miracles at his death and resurrection; 5thly, Christ himself at the same time opened *their understanding*, to know and believe this truth, that he was truly risen. Wi.  
**43** Christ eat, not because he stood in need of food to sustain himself after his resurrection, as we sustain our bodies and lives by corporal refreshment; but he did it, to shew his disciples that his body was really risen from the dead. Ven. Bede.  
**45** If, after all the extraordinary opportunities of instruction, which the apostles had had from the mouth of our divine Saviour, it was still necessary that he should instil into them a new light, by opening their minds to understand the Scriptures; what are we to think of the presumptuous attempts of the numerous tribe of modern self-inspired interpreters, who are always ready to descant on the word of the Lord; though so perfectly ignorant that their authority, so far from being admitted, would be laughed to scorn, were they to attempt to explain the slightest difficulty, on the most indifferent subject of profane literature? To such a degree has the spirit of seduction spread itself at the present day! A.  
**47** *Beginning at Jerusalem.* The sense is, that they were first to preach to the Jews, and afterwards to all nations. Wi.  
**49** *The promise of my Father;* i.e. the Holy Ghost, whom Christ had promised that his Father and he would send. Jo. 14:26 and 17:7. Wi.  
**51** Like a second Elias he was taken into heaven, but in a much more glorious manner. Elias was taken up in a mortal and corruptible body: but our divine Saviour, in a glorious, impassible, and immortal state; where now he is our head, having taken upon himself the nature of man, and is crowned with more than angel’s glory. Theophy.—What a glory this for us! Our head is clothed with everlasting glory; so shall we, his members, receive a share in his eternal kingdom. Chrys.
