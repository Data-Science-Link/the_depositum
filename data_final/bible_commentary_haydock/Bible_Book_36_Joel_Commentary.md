# Joel Commentary

**Joel**, whose name, according to S. Jerom, signifies *the Lord God*, (or, as others say, *the coming down of God*) prophesied about the same time in the kingdom of Juda as Osee did in the kingdom of Israel. He foretells, under figures, the great evils that were coming upon the people for their sins; earnestly exhorts them to repentance, and comforts them with the promise of a *teacher of jus* *tice*, viz. *Christ Jesus, our Lord*, and of the coming down of his *Holy Spirit* ( Ch). upon the hundred and twenty faithful assembled in Sion. He describes the land of the twelve tribes made desolate, and the people cast off. S. Jer. ad Paulin.—Yet he speaks chiefly of the kingdom of Juda, and mentions the house of God, sacrifices, &c. W.—S. Jerom infers from his being placed after Osee, without any fresh title, ( C.) that he lived in that order of time. W.—But this rule is not general, as Jonas lived before Amos; and Sept. observe not the same disposition of the prophets as we do. The exact time of the famine, when Joel prophesied, cannot be ascertained. It seems he addressed the people in autumn, when a second year’s famine was apprehended. He paints every thing with great force and beauty of style. C.

## Chapter 1

**1** *Planted.* Sept. “Bathuel.” He was born in the tribe of Gad, at Bethaven, the town which Herod styles Livias Jos. 13:27. C.  
**2** *Men.* Magistrates, and all who have children. H. He speaks to Juda, as the kingdom of Israel was ruined. C. 3:2. His principal object is to describe the ravages of locusts, and to exhort the people to repent, promising them better times after the captivity, and under the Messias. C. 2:28 and 3:20. C.  
**3** *Generation.* Prophecies relate to all future times, that people may see their accomplishment, ( W.) and believe. H.  
**4** *Left*, &c. Some understand this literally of the desolation of the land by these insects: others understand it of the different invasions of the Chaldeans, or other enemies. Ch.—Jerusalem was four times plundered by the Babylonians, and every time worse than before, as these four sorts of destructive things shew. But we shall not enlarge upon these points, nor pursue the mystical sense of the prophets, which may be found in the fathers and Ribera. W.—Others suppose that the Assyrians, Chaldeans, Greeks, (particularly Epiphanes) and Romans, are meant. We explain it simply of the devastation by insects. C.—Four different species of locusts are denoted. Bochart, p. 2. b. iv. 1.—*Mildew.* Heb. chasil, ( H.) is often rendered “a locust,” by Sept. (C. 2:25. &c.) and most suppose this is here the sense. The mildew destroys corn chiefly in low damp situations. C.  
**5** *Sweet.* Heb. “wine, because of the sweet wine,” ( H.) or liquors extracted from fruit. The things which you have abused, are now taken away.  
**6** *Natio* *ns.* Some understand the Assyrians or Chaldeans. But locusts are here styled a nation. Prov. 30:25.—*Lion.* Such locusts are described. Apoc. 9:8. C.—“In India they are said to be three feet long, and their legs and thighs are used for saws when dried.” Pliny xi. 29.—They were attacked by regular troops in Syria. Ib.  
**8** *Youth*, whom she espoused first. Such are more tenderly loved, particularly where polygamy prevails. C.—So Dido speaks of Sichæus, Virg. Æn. iv.:  
**9** *Lord.* No harvest being reaped, the fruits could not be paid. Yet it is thought that what was requisite for sacrifice, would be procured from other countries. C.—When Jerusalem was destroyed, sacrifices ceased. W.  
**12** *Withered.* The bite of locusts corrupts the juice of plants.  
**13** *Go in* to the temple, or sleep on sackcloth. Judith 4:9. C.  
**14** *Sanctify.* Appoint ( H.) or proclaim a general fast, as was usual in such emergencies. 3 K. 21:9 and 2 Par. 20:3. Fasting and other good works are calculated to appease God’s wrath. W.  
**15** *Day.* Heb. ahah layom*:* ( H.) “Ah, what a day!”—*Mighty.* Sept. “destruction.” They have read in a different manner. God is about to give sentence, ( C.) and to send Nabuchodonosor, (S. Jer.) or to destroy by famine. v. 17.  
**16** *God.* None can bring the first-fruits. All appear in mourning.  
**17** *Dung.* Horse-dung dried for bedding, was used in the East instead of straw, (Busb. 3.) as it is still by the Arabs. Darvieux. 11.—Heb. “the seeds are rotten under their clods,” ( H.) finding no moisture. Sept. “the cows have stamped in their stalls;” or Syr. “remain without food in their cribs.” Chal. “the pitchers of wine have been corrupted under their covers,” as there was no new wine. C.—*Houses.* Heb. mammeguroth. Prot. “barns, ( H.) or country houses;” which means cabins erected for the season, (Ruth 2:7) the *Magaria* ( C.) or *Mopalia* of the Africans. S. Jer. pref. Amos.—Sept. “the wine presses.” Wine and corn were preserved in pits carefully covered over. Agg. 2:20. These fell to decay, as there was no use for them.  
**19** *Places.* Heb. “dwellings,” or shepherds’ huts.—*W* *ilderness*, denoting all pasture land unploughed.  
**20** *Up*, as if to pray for rain. Jer. 14:6. C.—Heb. “cry,” ( H.) or “pant.”—*As … rain* is not in Heb. or Sept. C.

## Chapter 2

**1** *Blow.* The prophets often ordered, to signify what will take place. W.—The people were gathered by the sound of trumpets. The danger from the locusts was imminent; and all are exhorted to avert it, by praying in the temple, &c.—*Tremble* at the sound. Amos 3:6. C.—*Extemplò turbati* *.* Virgil, Æneid viii.—*Lord.* That is, the time when he will execute justice on sinners, ( Ch.) and suffer affliction to fall upon them. W. C. 1:15.  
**2** *Darkness.* This implies great misery. v. 10. C.—*People.* The Assyrians or Chaldeans. Others understand all this of the army of locusts laying waste the land. Ch.—*Morning;* unexpectedly, ( C.) and soon. H.—No human force can prevent the ravages of the locusts—*Beginning*, in Palestine. Moses says the same; but speaks of Egypt. Ex. 10:14.  
**3** *Flame.* They destroy all by their bite. C. 1:12. C. Theod.—*Pleasure.* Heb. “Eden.” So luxuriant was Palestine.  
**4** *Horsemen.* The head of a locust bears some resemblance with that of a horse, and its flight is rapid. Apoc. 9:7. C.  
**5** *Mountains.* “The beat their wings so loudly, that they may be taken for other birds.” Pliny xi. 29.—They are much larger in hot climates, (C. 1:6. H.) and may be heard at the distance of two miles, (Bochart) darkening the air for the space of four leagues. Yet this description is poetical, and perhaps an allegory is nowhere better kept up.  
**6** *Kettle.* The Jews were naturally of a dark complexion. Fear causing the blood to retire, would make them black. Is. 13:8. Lam. 4:8 and 5:10. C.  
**7** *Ranks.* Locusts march like a regular army. Theod.—No fortification can keep them out. H.  
**8** *Brother.* S. Jerom saw a cloud of them in Judea. They were not “a finger-nail’s breadth from each other.” C.—The Arabs discover the military art in them. Bochart.—They invested France ( A. 874) with all the skill of an army, the chiefs marking out the place for the camp the night before. Sigebert.—*Windows.* They eat the wood, ( H.) and the windows were simple lattices or curtains. C.—Heb. “they fall upon the sword, and shall not be hurt.” Sept. “consumed *or* filled.” H.—They are never satisfied. Theod.  
**10** *Shining.* The cloud of locusts intercepts the light; or, people in distress think all nature is in confusion. S. Jer. Ezec. xxxii. Jer. iv. 23.—Aloysius (13) saw locusts in the air for the space of twelve miles; and among the Cossacks, clouds of them may be found six leagues in length and three in breadth. They frequently occasion a famine in Ethiopia. C.  
**11** *Voice;* thunder, ( H.) or the noise of locusts. v. 5. C.  
**12** *Mourning.* For moving the heart to repentance these external works are requisite, at least in will: if they be wilfully omitted, it is a sure sign that the heart is not moved. S. Jer. W.  
**13** *Garments*, as was customary in great distress. God will not be satisfied with mere external proofs of repentance. C.—*Evil.* He will forego his threats if we do penance. S. Jer.—He punishes unwillingly. Is. 28:21.  
**14** *Who knoweth.* Confidence in God and repentance must accompany prayer.—*Blessing;* plentiful crops, so that the usual sacrifices may be performed again. C. 1:9.  
**15** *Trumpet.* Thus were festivals announced. Num. 10:7.  
**16** **Ve** **r.** **16** **.** *Sanctify.* Let all make themselves ready to appear.—*Ones.* Their cries would make an impression on men, and prevail on God to shew mercy. Judith 4:9.  
**17** *Altar* of holocausts. They turned towards the holy place, lying prostrate. 1 Esd. 10:1 and 2 Mac. 10:26. C.—Hither the victim of expiation was brought, and the high priest confessed. Maimon.—*Over them*, as they might easily have done during the famine.  
**18** *Zealous.* Indignation is excited when a person perceives any thing contemned which he loves. So God resented the injuries done maliciously by the Gentiles towards his people; though he often punished them for their correction or greater merit. W.—He will resent the blasphemies uttered by infidels against his holy name, and will restore fertility to the land. C.  
**19** *Nati* *ons.* This did not take place till after the seventy years captivity, nor then fully. It is verified in true believers, and after death in the glory of the saints. W.  
**20** *The northern* enemy. Some understand this of Holofernes and his army, others of the locusts. Ch.—Prot. “the northern *army.*” Heb. may denote ( H.) *wind.* This often drives away locusts. Those here spoken of were drowned in the Mediterranean and Dead Seas. C.—This occasioned a pestilence, (S. Jer. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. iv. 31.) to prevent which the locusts were to be speedily buried. Is. 33:4.—*Proudly.* Heb. “great things.” God, or the locusts are meant.  
**22** *Strength;* fruit, as formerly.  
**23** *Teacher;* Joel, &c. or rather the Messias. John 1:9. Mat. 23:8. Some translate Heb. “rain.” Sept. “meat,” ( C.) sufficient for the people. Theod.  
**24** *Presses*, or subterraneous reservoirs.  
**25** *Host.* God could have hurled his thunderbolts, or mountains, to destroy all mankind; but he chooses to shew their insignificance, ( C.) by employing the vilest insects, which they cannot withstand. S. Jer.  
**28** *After.* From this verse to the end the prophet speaks of the times succeeding the captivity, and more especially of the propagation of the gospel. The enemies of God’s people shall be destroyed, (C. 3:1) which seems to refer to Cambyses. Ezec. 38. C.—*My spirit.* This plainly foretells the coming of the Holy Ghost. Acts 2. W.—The Jews never had such a multitude of prophets after the captivity as the Church had. 1 Cor. 14:24. What relates to them was only a shadow of what would befall true believers.  
**29** *H* *andmaids.* Sept. of S. Jer. and S. Peter read, *my handmaids.* “My,” is omitted in both places in Complut. and Heb. and the latter word in the Rom. Sept.  
**30** *Wonders.* Many prodigies preceded the persecution of Epiphanes, the death of Christ, the ruin of the temple, and more will be seen before the day of judgment. Though we cannot prove the same with respect to Cambyses, it suffices that the people were thrown into the utmost consternation (v. 2. 11) when he forebade the building of the temple, (1 Esd. 4:6) and designed to plunder them. Ezechiel (38:11) speaks of the same event, as the Jews assert. Ctesias also mentions that when he offered sacrifice, the victims would not bleed; and that his wife, Roxana, brought forth a child without a head, implying, according to the magi, that he should have no heir. His mother also frequently appeared, and reproached him with the murder of his brother. See C. 3:15. Ezec. 38:22.  
**32** *Call.* Amid these fears, those who trust in the Lord shall have nothing to suffer. Cambyses could not execute his designs. But the prophet here alludes still more to the conversion of the Gentiles. Acts 2:21. Rom. 10:13. Some returned from Babylon, as a figure of this great event. Only a few Jews embraced the faith. C.—*Salvation.* Sept. “shall be saved, as the Lord hath spoken, and the person preaching the gospel, whom the Lord hath called.” H.

## Chapter 3

**1** *Back.* The people were just returned when the nations around fell upon them, and were miraculously defeated. Theod.—We shall follow the system respecting God, given Ezec. 38. C.—Most people, with S. Jerom, suppose that the general judgment is described, though some explain it of the captives delivered from their enemies. W.  
**2** *Josaphat*, “the judgment of the Lord,” ( H.) marks the place where the Judge will sit, on the east of Jerusalem, between the temple and Olivet, whence our Lord ascended into heaven. W.—There also had been seized and treated contumeliously. H.—But many of the Fathers assert that the whole world will be the scene of judgment, and the first author who determines the situation of Josaphat, is one in the works of V. Bede. Here it may denote the great plain reaching from Carmel to the Jordan, where the army of Cambyses perished with its chief. People of almost *all nations* were there. Ezec. 38.—*Land.* The Chaldees, now governed by a Persian, had scattered the Jews, and the Idumeans had seized part of their land.  
**3** *Boy*, to gratify their brutal passions; (Lam. 5) or, they have exchanged such for harlots, ( C.) and paid the latter with captive boys. Sept. H.  
**4** *Me.* These cities and nations had rejoiced at the ruin of the Jews. Ezec. 25. C.—*Coast.* Sept. “Galilee of strangers.” H.  
**5** *Temples*, or palaces. The Chaldeans had done so, and perhaps had sold some to others.  
**6** *Greeks:* the Ionians carried on such a traffic. Ezec. 27:13. Tyre and the Philistines were ready to sell. ib. 26:2 and 25:15.  
**7** *Them*, particularly under Hystaspes and Artaxerxes.  
**8** Sabeans; probably at the bottom of Arabia. C.—Thirty thousand Tyreans were sold by Alexander. Arrian ii.—The Jews would not fail to purchase. C.  
**9** *Prepare.* Lit. “sanctify.” H.—God sends Cambyses to chastise Egypt. His turn will then come.  
**11** *Down.* Many perished in Egypt, the rest in Judea. v. 2.  
**11** *Valley*, at Jezrahel, *the valley* of destruction. v. 14.  
**13** *Harvest*, the time of vengeance. Mat. 13:30. Apoc. 14:15. C.  
**14** *Nations.* Heb. hamonim, “multitudes.” H.—This alludes to the place Amona, where God was buried. Ezec. 30:15. 18. C.—Sept. “sounds have been heard in the vale of justice,” where sentence has been pronounced and executed. H.—The repetition of *peoples* and *destruction*, shews the crowds ( H.) which shall be judged and cut in pieces like fuel for the fire. Ps. 128:4. W.  
**15** *Shining.* All shall be amazed at the fall of Cambyses. C. 2:30. Ezec. 28:18. A storm shall overwhelm his army. C.  
**16** *Roar*, in thunder. Jer. 25:30. Amos 1:2. H.  
**17** *No more*, for a long time. Antiochus and the Romans again profaned the temple. But the Church of Christ is always holy.  
**18** *Sweetness;* oil and honey. C.—*Fountain*, &c. viz. the fountain of grace in the Church militant, and of glory in the Church triumphant; which shall water *the torrent* or valley *of thorns*, that is, the souls that before, like barren ground, brought forth nothing but *thorns*, or that were afflicted with the *thorns* of crosses and tribulations. Ch.—Sept. have, “bands.” Heb. shittim*.* H.—Abundance shall ensue after the death of Cambyses, as a figure of the graces which shall be granted to Christians. Ezec. 47:2.  
**19** *Desolation.* Cambyses laid it waste for three years, as Ochus did afterwards.—Edom*.* Judas and Hican punished them for their former barbarity. Ps. 136:7 and 2 Mac. 10:16. Ezechiel 25:12. C.  
**20** *Judea* and *Jerusalem.* That is, the spiritual Jerusalem, viz. the Church of Christ. Ch.—Judea was unmolested for a considerable time.  
**21** *Which* must be supplied in Hebrew. The Idumeans had been spared for a long time. But they shall not escape. Chal. &c. C.—The rites of the law could not purify, as the sacraments of Christ do. S. Jer.—God will cleanse his people, and will chastise the Ammonites, &c. who had injured them. Sept. “I will seek (or avenge) their blood, and will not pronounce innocent;” αθωωσω. H.—*Sion*, in heaven, ( M.) and in the tabernacles of the Catholic Church, from the beginning of the world unto eternity. H.
