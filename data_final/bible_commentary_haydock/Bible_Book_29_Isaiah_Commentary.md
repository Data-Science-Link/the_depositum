# Isaiah Commentary

This inspired writer is called by the Holy Ghost, (Ecclesiastic. 48:25) *the great prophet;* from the greatness of his prophetic spirit, by which he hath foretold, so long before, and in so clear a manner, the coming of Christ, the mysteries of our redemption, the calling of the Gentiles, and the glorious establishment, and perpeutal flourishing of the Church of Christ: insomuch that he seems to have been rather an evangelist than a prophet. His very name is not without mystery: for *Isaias* in Hebrew signifies *the salvation of the Lord*, or, *Jesus is the Lord.* He was, according to the tradition of the Hebrews, of the blood royal of the kings of Juda; an after a most holy life, ended his days by a glorious martyrdom; being sawed in two, at the command of his wicked son-in-law, king Manasses, for reproving his evil ways. Ch.—He began to prophesy ten years before the foundation of Rome, and the ruin of Ninive. His style is suitable to his high birth. He may be called the prophet of the mercies of the Lord. Under the figure of the return from captivity, he foretells the redemption of mankind ( C.) with such perspicuity, that he might seem to be an evangelist. S. Jer.

## Chapter 1

**1** *Amos.* His name is written in a different manner, in Hebrew, from that of the third among the minor prophets, ( W.) though S. Aug. has confounded them.—*Ezechias.* He wrote this title towards the end of his life, or it was added by Esdras, &c.  
**2** *Earth.* He apostrophises these insensible things, ( C.) because they contain all others, and are the most durable. Theod. Deut. 31:1.  
**5** **Ver** **.** **5–7** **.** *Sad.* This was spoken after Ozias had given way to pride, when the Ammonites, &c. began to disturb Juda, (4 K. 15:37 and 2 Par. 27:7) under Joathan, who was a good prince, but young. C.—*Enemies.* At the last siege, (S. Jer.) or rather when Jerusalem was taken by the Chaldees. C.—Many, from the highest to the lowest, had prevaricated: but God always preserved his Church. W.  
**8** *Cucumbers.* Or melons, which grew in the fields, and huts were erected for guards, till they were gathered.  
**10** *Sodom.* Juda is so styled reproachfully, ( C.) because the princes imitated the crimes of that devoted city. Ezec. 16:49. Inf. c. 2:6 and 3:9. M.  
**11** *Victims.* Without piety, they are useless. God tolerated bloody victims to withdraw the people from idolatry, but he often shewed that they were not of much importance, in order that they might be brought to offer the sacrifice of the new law, which eminently includes all the rest. S. Jer. Ps. xlix. 9. Am. v. 21. Jer. vi. 20. Theod.  
**14** *Bearing.* Hebrew, &c. “pardoning,” ( C.) or “bearing.” Sept. “I will no longer pardon your sins.” H.  
**16** *Wash.* Interiorly. C.—He seems to allude to baptism. Eus. Theod.  
**18** *Accuse me.* If I punish you without cause.  
**22** *Water.* There is no sincerity in commerce. C.—Teachers give false interpretations of the law. S. Jer.—Iniquity abounded before the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldees and Romans. W.  
**24** *Ah!* God punishes with regret. M.—*Comfort.* I will take complete vengeance under Joathan, (4 K. 15:37.) Achaz, &c.  
**25** *Tin.* I will reform abuses in the reign of Ezechias, but much more by establishing the Church of Christ, which shall be the *faithful city.* C.  
**26** *Judges.* The Jews explain this of the judges, and priests, who governed after the captivity; though it refer rather to the apostles, &c. S. Jer. W.  
**29** *Idols.* Prot. “oaks, which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens,” &c. H.—the groves were sacred to Venus, and the gardens to Adonis, and were scenes of the greatest immorality and profanation. C. 65:3.  
**31** *It.* The efforts of Achan and Ezechias against the enemy proved in vain. C.  

---

## Chapter 2

**1** *Jerusalem.* Many particular prophecies are blended with the general one, which regards Christ. C.  
**2** *Days.* The whole time of the new law, from the coming of Christ till the end of the world, is called in the Scripture *the last days;* because no other age, or time shall come after it, but only eternity. Ch.—It is therefore styled the last hour. 1 Jo. 2. W.—*Mountains.* This shews the perpetual visibility of the Church of Christ: for a mountain upon the top of mountains cannot be hid. Ch.—This evidently regards the Church. Mat. 5 W.—The Jews can never shew the fulfillment of this prophecy in any material temple. Micheas (4:1) copies this text.  
**3** *Jerusalem.* Our Saviour preached there, and in some sense the religion established by him, may be esteemed a reform, or accomplishment of the old law.  
**4** *War.* Ezechias enjoyed peace after the defeat of Sennacherib, as the whole world did at the birth of Christ. C.—*Claudentur belli portæ* *.* Æn. i.  
**5** *Lord.* Ezechias, or rather Christ and his Church, invite all to embrace the true faith. C.  
**6** *Jacob.* Thus the converts address God, ( H.) or the prophet give the reasons of the subversion of the ten tribes.—*Filled* *.* Consecrated as priests.—*Children.* Imitating idolatrous nations, ( C.) and marrying with them, ( C. Sept. Theod.) or even giving way to unnatural sins. S. Jer. M.—The Jews were not utterly cast off till they had put Christ to death. His Church shall never perish. W.  
**8** *Horses.* Which the kings were forbidden to multiply. Deut. 17:16. Great riches often precede the ruin of states.  
**9** *Forgiv* *e.* Sept. “I will not dismiss them.” Heb. “and thou hast not pardoned them.”  
**10** *Rock.* Screen thyself if thou canst. He alludes to the kingdom of Israel, which was ruined by idolatry. v. 18. 20.  
**13** **V** **er.** **13** **.** *Basan* *.* Israel; or Syria and the Ammonites, ( C.) whom Nabuchodonosor subdued, five years after he had taken Jerusalem, (Joseph. x. 11.) as the Idumeans, (v. 14.) Philistines, and Egyptians, (v. 15) and Tyrians, (v. 16) who felt also the indignation of the Lord. Jer. 25:15.  
**16** Tharsis*.* In Cilicia, denoting large ships for merchandise.—*Fair.* Heb. “desirable pictures.” Sept. “ships.” C.  
**18** *Destroyed.* This was verified by the establishment of Christianity. And by this and other texts of the like nature, the wild system of some modern sectaries is abundantly confuted, who charge the whole Christian Church with worshipping idols, for many ages. Ch.—Yea, for above a thousand years, while she still professed the name of Christ. W.  
**20** *Bats.* The Egyptians adored all sorts of animals. Herod. ii. 65.—*Ægyptus portenta colat* *.* Juv. xv.—*Omnigenumque Deum monstra* *.* Æn. viii.—The mole was much esteemed by magicians, who promised any the art of divination and success, who should eat the heart of one still warm. Pliny xxx. 3. The Israelites were always ready to embrace such superstitious practices. C.  
**22** *High.* Adhere to Jesus Christ. Orig. M.—Sept. omit this sentence, and S. Jer. thinks they did it perhaps for fear of shocking their brethren. In Jer. 17.—It is supplied from Aquila’s version, “how must he be esteemed?” C.—Prot. “for wherein is he to be accounted of?” Jesus will kill the wicked one with the spirit of his mouth. 2 Thess. 2:8. H.—No dependence must be had in man. The Israelites vainly trusted in Egypt. C.  

---

## Chapter 3

**1** *Strong.* Heb. and Sept. imply, “woman.” H.—*Validam* *.* S. Cyp. Test. i.—After the death of Christ, the Jews had none strong. S. Jerom—*Strength.* Heb. “staff,” or support (Lev. 26:26) in the dreadful famine which fell on Jerusalem. Lam. 4:5. 10. Who then shall rely on the power of any man? C. 2:22. C.—The Jews were depressed at the sieges of their city, and will be so till the end of the world. W.  
**2** *Prophet.* Ezechiel was taken away under Jechonias. Other prophets were disregarded, and the *cunning man*, (*ariolus*, which may be understood in a good or bad sense. C.) every false prophet was silent, when danger threatened.  
**3** *Countenance.* Sept. “the admired counsellor,” ( H.) who came into the king’s presence.—*Architect.* 4 K. 24:14. C.—*Eloquent.* Lit. “mystic.” H.—Aquila and Sym. “enchanter.”  
**4** *Effeminate.* Heb. “babes.” Sept. “scoffers.” Aquila, &c. “changers,” ( C.) who give way to unnatural excesses. Rom. 1:27. H.—Some manifest a prudence beyond their years: but the last kings of Juda did not. 2 Par. 36:1. Eccle. 10:16.  
**5** *People.* They were divided, whether they should continue to obey Nabuchodonosor, or listen to the Egyptians. Ismael slew Godolias. Jer. 41.  
**6** *Garment.* They were ready to follow any, who was not quite destitute, like themselves. Jer. 39:10.—*Ruin.* Fallen people.  
**7** *Clothing.* The indigent were excluded from dignities, for fear lest they should seek to enrich themselves by unjustifiable means. Ex. 18:22. Plut. in Sol. Pliny xvi. 19. C.  
**8** *For.* The prophet tells what will happen. M.—*And their.* Sept. “are sinful, disbelieving what regards the Lord. Wherefore now their glory is brought low.” H.—They must have followed a very different Hebrew copy from ours. C.  
**9** *Shew*, (*agnitio* *.*) “Knowledge.” W.—Impudence, &c. C.—*Hacurath* ( H.) occurs no where else. C.—From their countenance we may judge that they are proud, &c. M.  
**10** *Well.* Jeremias (39:11) was treated by the enemy with great respect. Sept. “having said, let us bind the just man, for he is troublesome, ( H.) or displeasing ( C.) to us. Hence they,” &c. H. Wisd. 2:12. Many of the Fathers quote it thus. But our version agrees well with the original, as Isaias joins consoling predictions with those which are of a distressing nature. C.—Yet the Sept. seem to have thrown light on the Heb. by supplying an omission from the book of Wisdom. Houbig.—Thus all must be explained of the wicked, whose malice shall be punished.—*He shall.* S. Jer. and all versions read, “they shall eat the fruit of their doings, *or* devices.” *Fructum adinventionum suarum comeden* *t* *.* H.—All who hear of this must applaud the *just* God for acting *well* in their punishment. According to the Sept. Christ and his adversaries are clearly pointed out. S. Jer.  
**12** *Women.* “Let no women be our senate, as the impious Porphyrius objects.” The scribes and Pharisees sought for lucre and pleasure. The teacher approved by the Church must excite tears and not laughter; he must correct sinners, and pronounce no one *blessed.* S. Jer. H.—The last kings of Juda were real tyrants, and weak as women. C.—*Blessed.* Prot. marg. and the text has, “lead thee.”  
**16** *Pace.* Prot. “and making a tinkling with their feet,” ( H.) by means of little rings round their legs. C. *Stridore ad se juvenes vocat* *.* S. Jer. ep. xlvii.—The daughters of Sion, denote all the cities and villages which were defaced by the Chaldees, and still more by the Romans, forty years after Christ. S. Jer. W.  
**17** *Bald.* Like slaves. Deut. 21:12.—*Hair.* Heb. and Sept. “shame.”  
**18** *Of shoes.* Heb. “gold tissue.” Ps. 44:14. This term occurs no where else, and many of these superfluous ornaments are not well known. But we may conclude that they are pernicious to a state, and hateful to God. C.—*Decorem … invitatore* *m libidinis scimus* *.* Tert. cult.  
**24** *Stench.* The Jews are noted on this account, as if in consequence of this curse, or of their being confined to prisons, &c. *Fœtentium Judæorum et tumultuantium* *sæpe tædio percitus* *.*—M. Aurelius “was often weary of the stinking and seditious Jews.” Marcellin ii.  
**25** *Fairest.* They shall not be spared. C.—“As they have perished by their beauty, their fairest,” &c. Chal.  
**26** *Ground.* The posture of captives. Lam. 1:1.  

---

## Chapter 4

**1** *Seven.* Many shall sue for a husband, men shall be so scarce. To continue unmarried was reproachful. Deut. 7:14. C.—After the conversion of the Gentiles, pastors will be much wanted. W.  
**2** *Bud.* That is, Christ, ( Ch.) who was faintly prefigured by Zorobabel. Zac. 3:8. Our Saviour was the fruit of the earth, and sovereign Lord. C.  
**3** *Life.* Only the faithful shall be saved. W.—The Jews, after the captivity, shall be more obedient. But converts to the faith of Christ are styled *saints*, (Rom. 1:7. &c.) such particularly as are predestined to glory. Rom. 8:30. C.—Those who are called to life and the true faith, may forfeit this honour, by their own fault. M.  
**4** *Burning.* By baptism of water and fire, or of the Holy Ghost. S. Jer.  
**5** *Protection.* God will protect his Church, more than he did the Israelites by the pillar. Ex. 14:20. S. Bas. &c.  

---

## Chapter 5

**1** *My cousin.* So the prophet calls Christ, as being of his family and kindred, by descending from the house of David. Ch. M.—Heb. and Sept. “beloved.” *Dod* may also mean a near relation. C.—Isaias being of the same tribe, sets before us the lamentations of Christ over Jerusalem. Lu. 19:41. W.—The Hebrews had canticles of sorrow, as well as of joy. The prophet thus endeavours to impress more deeply on the minds of the people what he had been saying. The master of the vineyard is God himself. v. 7. C.—*Hill.* Lit. *in the horn, the son of oil.* Ch.—The best vines grew among olive and fig trees. Doubdan 21.—Sept. “in a horn, (*mountain*) in a fat soil.” H.  
**2** *Stones.* They burn and starve in different seasons. Col. 2:3.—*Choicest.* Heb. sorek. H.—There was a famous valley of this name. Judg. 16:4. The angels guarded the vineyard, in which Abraham, Moses, &c. were found.—*Tower.* To keep the wine, &c. Mat. 21:33. It denotes the temple, ( C.) Scriptures, &c. M.—*Wild.* Sour. Deut. 32:32.  
**3** *Judge.* God condescends to have his conduct scrutinized. C. 41:1.  
**4** *Was it.* “Why has it produced wild grapes, while I looked?” &c.  
**5** *Down.* By the Chaldees, and after the death of Christ. C.—when God withdraws his aid, man is unable to stand. Yet he falls by his own fault, which God only permits. W.  
**6** *It.* During the whole of the captivity, the land might keep its sabbaths. Lev. 26:34. C.—The people shall be deprived of saving doctrine. M.  
**7** *Israel.* This comparison is very common. Ps. 79:9. Mat. 20:1. C.—The preceding parable is explained. M.—*Cry.* For vengeance. Jer. 12:8. Gen. 4:10 and 18:20. C.  
**8** *Even.* Sept. “to take from your neighbour: shall,” &c. H.  
**9** *Things.* Unjust practices.—*Inhabitant.* What will your avarice avail, ( H.) since you must abandon all? C.  
**10** *Measure.* Heb. “both.”—*Thirty.* Heb. “a chomer shall yield an epha.”  
**11** *To follow.* Heb. “for shecar,” ( C.) palm wine, (Theod.) or any inebriating liquor. S. Jer. in C. xxviii. Our version is conformable to Aquila and Sym. H.—Num. 6:3. Eccle. 10:16.  
**12** *Work.* Chastisement. v. 19 and c. 28:21. C.—They are admonished to observe the festivals of the Lord, and not to indulge in riotousness. W.  
**14** *Hell.* Or the grave, which never says enough. Prov. 30:15. Isaias alludes to what should happen under Nabuchodonosor, as if it were past. G.  
**16** *Justice.* All will be taught to adore him. H.  
**17** *Strangers.* Ammonites, &c. ( C.) shall occupy part of the land. H.  
**18** *Cart.* Fatiguing themselves with iniquity, (Wisd. 5:7. C.) and delaying your conversion. S. Isid. M.  
**19** *It.* The Jews were often guilty of the like insolence. Jer. 17:15.  
**21** *Conceits.* Blind guides. Mat. 15:14.  
**22** *Drink.* Heb. “mix shecar.” People generally mixed wine and water. They also strove who could drink most, and the Greeks had a feast for this purpose, ( C.) which they styled *Choas*, for the measure which was to be swallowed down. Aristoph. Acharn. act. iv. 4. and 5. ult.—Cyrus the younger boasted to the Gr. ambassadors, that “he could drink and bear more wine than his brother.” Plut. in Artax.  
**23** *Justice.* Declaring the righteous guilty. v. 20. H.  
**25** *Still.* After the ruin of Jerusalem, the people were led away. C.—Grievous sins must be severely punished, as was that of the murderers of Christ. W.  
**26** *Off.* Like a king, leading all his subjects to battle. C.—*Whistle.* He alludes to the custom of leading forth bees by music. C. 7:18. S. Cyr.—*Earth.* The Chaldees, (c. 41:9. Jer. 6:22) and not the Romans, as some would suppose.—*Swiftly.* Like an eagle. Dan. 7:4. Jer. 48:40.  
**27** *Broken.* They shall march incessantly. Ezec. 26:7 and 30:11.  
**28** *Hoofs.* They were hardened, but not shod. Xenoph. Amos 6:13.  
**29** *Lion.* Nabuchodonosor is compared to one. v. 26. Jer. 4:7.  
**30** *Mist.* Denoting calamity. Heb. “ruin.” Sept. “indigence.” C.  

---

## Chapter 6

**1** *Died.* Either a natural ( C.) or a civil death, by means of the leprosy. Chal. Tostat. 7.—This and the former chapters relate to the commencement of Joathan’s reign, whether before or after the death of Ozias. C.—Many think that this was the first prediction of Isaias. Orig. S. Jer. ad Dam.—*I saw.* By a prophetic vision, as if I had been present at the dedication of the temple. 3 K. 8:10. C.—*Lord.* Not the Father, as some have asserted, but the Son. Jo. 12:40. S. Jer. ad Dam. C.—Neither Moses nor any other saw the substance of God; but only a shadow. Yet Manasses hence took a pretext to have Isaias slain. Orig. S. Jer. Trad. Paral. W.  
**2** *The* two Seraphims “burning.” They are supposed to constitute the highest order of angels. Num. 21:6.—*His.* God’s or their own face. Heb. and Sept. are ambiguous. Out of respect, ( C.) they look not at the divine majesty. M.  
**3** *Glory.* By no means of the Incarnation. The unity and Trinity are insinuated. S. Jer. S. Greg. Mor. xxix. 16.  
**4** *Of him.* Sept. “them,” ( H.) the Seraphim signifying that the veil was removed by the death of Christ, (Theod.) or that the people should be led into captivity, as a Jew explained it to S. Jerom.  
**5** *Peace.* It is proper for sinners to do so. Eccli. 15:9. The prophet was grieved that he was unworthy to join in the acclamation of the Seraphim, and had reason to fear death. Gen. 16:13. Ex. 33:20. He finds himself less able to speak than before, like Moses. Ex. 4:10 and 6:12.  
**6** *Coal.* “Carbuncle,” (Sept.) the word of God, (S. Basil) spirit of prophecy, (S. Jer. 142. ad Dam.) &c.  
**7** *Sin.* Impediment in speech. All defects were attributed to some sin, (Jo. 9:2) as Job’s friends maintained.  
**8** *For us.* Hence arises a proof of the plurality of persons. C.—*Send me.* Thus Isaias was an evangelical and apostolical prophet. S. Jer. W.  
**10** *Blind.* The prophets are said to do what they denounce. S. Tho. 1. q. xxiv. 3. Sanct.—Sept. “heavy or gross is the heart,” &c. The authors of the New Testament quote it thus less harshly.—*Them.* Is God unwilling to heal? Why then does he send his prophet? C.—He intimates that all the graces offered would be rendered useless by the hardened Jews. S. Isid. Pelus. 2. ep. 270.—Heb. may be, “surely they will not see,” &c. C.  
**11** *Desolate.* By means of Nabuchodonosor, (S. Chrys.) and the Romans, (Eus. &c.) or even till the end of the world, their obstinacy will continue.  
**12** *Earth.* After the captivity, the people shall be more docile. But this was more fully verified by the preaching of the gospel.  
**13** *Tithing.* The land shall produce its fruits, and people shall bring their tithes. Ezec. 20:40. There shall be some left; (c. 1:9 and 4:3. C.) though only a tenth part will embrace Christianity. S. Bas.—*Made.* Sept. “ravaged.” They shall be exposed to many persecutions under Epiphanes, and few shall escape the arms of the Romans, ( C.) those particularly ( H.) who shall be a *holy seed.* C.—The apostles were of Jewish extraction, ( H.) and spread the gospel throughout the world. M.

## Chapter 7

**1** *Achaz.* This must be seventeen years later than the former prediction. 4 K. 15:37. The kings of Syria and Israel jointly attacked Juda, but were forced to raise the siege of Jerusalem. The next year they came separately, and committed the following ravages. The news of their junction threw all into confusion. v. 2. Isaias was then sent to inform the king, that the designs of his enemies should not take effect. Yet the two kings obtained each a victory. But they could not dethrone Achaz, as they intended. C.—Paine traduces this prophecy as a lie, asserting that they succeeded. What! did they make Tabeel king? v. 6. The Israelites would not even keep the captives who had been taken. 2 Chron. 28:15. Watson, let. 5.—Achaz had been made captive before. But now the Lord defeated the projects of his enemies, as he will the conspiracy of heretics against his Church. W.  
**3** *Jasub.* This name was mysterious: Shear-Jashub means “the rest shall return” from Babylon, or be converted under Ezechias. C. 10:22. C.—Prot. Go “thou, and Shear-Jashub, thy son, at the end of the conduit,” &c. H.  
**4** *Tails.* So he styles the two kings in derision. The distrust of Achaz was punished by the loss of many of his subjects, but he was not dethroned, having engaged the Egyptians and Assyrians to attack his enemies. v. 17.  
**6** *Tabeel* *.* Chal. “whom we shall think proper.” He will not so much as name him.  
**8** *Rasin* *.* Both the king and his capital shall be ruined.—*And five.* Capellus (p. 497.) would read six and five; or, in eleven years time. But ( C.) Ephraim was led captive twenty-one years after, and the Cutheans took their place when sixty-five years had elapsed. A. 3327. Usher—Most people date from the prophecy of Amos to the ruin of Samaria, just sixty-five years. The former solution seems preferable. C.  
**9** *Continue.* Sept. “and will not understand, even the Lord,” &c. H.—Heb. “and since you do not believe,” ( C.) or “because you are not confirmed” by a miracle. Grot.  
**11** *Above.* Require it to thunder, (1 K. 12:17) or the earth to open. Num. 16:28. C.  
**12** *Lord.* He was afraid of being forced to relinquish his evil ways. S. Jer.—Though an idolater, he knew he ought not to tempt God.  
**14** *Virgin, halma*, ( H.) one secluded from the company of men. Alma in Latin signifies “a holy person,” and in Punic “a virgin.” The term is never applied to any but “a young virgin.” If it meant a young woman, what sort of a sign would this be? S. Jer.—It was indeed above the sagacity of man to declare that the child to be born would be a boy, and live till the kings should be destroyed. But the prophet undoubtedly speaks of Jesus Christ, *the wonderful*, &c. (c. 9:5) as well as of a boy, who should prefigure him, and be an earnest of the speedy destruction of the two kings. He was to be born of Isaias, (c. 8:4) and of all the qualities belonging to the true *Emmanuel*, only that regards him, which intimates that the country should be delivered before he should come to years of discretion. v. 16. C. Diss. Bossuet—The Fathers generally apply all to Christ.—*Called.* Or shall be in effect. C. 1:26. C.—The king hardly trusted in God’s mercies, whereupon the incarnation of Christ, &c. is foretold. W.  
**15** *Honey.* Like other infants. C.—The new baptized received some to remind them of innocence. Tert. cor. 3.—Christ shall be true man. M.  
**16** *Good.* Being arrived at the age of discretion, Achaz engaged the Assyrians to invade Damascus. Its citizens and four tribes were carried into captivity the year following. Phacee only survived another year, A. 3265. This was a pledge, that what regarded the son of the virgin would also be accomplished. C.—*Land* of the enemy. C. 4 K. 16. M.  
**17** *Assyrians.* His aid shall prove the greatest scourge, (2 Par. 28:20) while the Idumeans and Philistines shall also ravage the country. 28:17. Achaz has vainly trusted in man.  
**18** *Of Egypt.* The Idumeans, &c. dwell on the borders. C. 5:26. Yet many explain this of the victories of Nabuchodonosor and Nechas.  
**20** *Razor.* Or cut off with scissors all the hair, as was done with lepers, (Lev. 14:9) and Levites. Num. 8:7. The country shall be pillaged, and all shall be in mourning. C.—The men shall be despised as no better than women and cowards. S. Jer. Theod.—*Hired.* With large sums. C.  
**22** *Land.* Pastures shall be so large, ( M.) though uncultivated, the greatest part of the inhabitants being removed.  
**23** *Pieces.* Sicles. This was the price of the best vineyards. Cant. 8:2. C.—Now people may hunt in them. H.—The subjects of Achaz were much reduced. C.  
**24** *Thither.* The hedges shall be rooted up ( H.) or neglected, so that cattle may graze. M.—Two sorts of mountains are specified; some for vineyards, and others for pasture. C.

## Chapter 8

**1** *Book.* This mystery would require a large explanation. W.—*Pen.* Lit. “style.” H.—Write intelligibly. Here all is plain. C.—*Take.* Prot. “concerning Mahershalalchashbaz.” Marg. “in making speed to the spoil, he hasteneth the prey.” H.—*Chashbaz*, the son of Isaias, was a sign that Syria and Israel should soon be rendered desolate; and in a more elevated sense, he shewed that Christ should overturn the powers of hell. C.—The virgin’s son took the prey from the devil, who before possessed almost all the world. W.—*Urias* *.* Probably the high priest, who afterwards weakly complied with the king’s idolatrous order. 4 K. 16:10. C.—Yet at this time, he was a credible witness. H.—*Zacharias* *.* A person to us unknown. C.  
**3** *Prophetess.* The blessed Virgin, (S. Chrys. &c.) or to his wife. He gives his son a different name from Emmanuel, (c. 7:14) that they might not be confounded.—*Hasten.* Heb. Mahershalalchashbaz*.* v. 1. H.  
**4** *Assyrians.* Theglathphalassar, the next year, took the Damascenes to Kir, and Nephthali, Reuben, Gad, and Manasses into captivity. Yet the kingdom continued some time longer. Never was prediction more explicit. Can the pagans produce any thing similar?  
**6** *Silence.* Being willing to receive Tabeel, instead of their lawful prince. Achaz was then terrified, and chose to become tributary, rather than to lose his crown. Herein both offended God, in whom they ought to have trusted; and the auxiliary king looked upon himself as master of the country. 2 Par. 28:20. C.—Israel had joined with the Syrian; but was reduced to the state of captivity, while Jerusalem was preserved. W.  
**7** *River.* Euphrates, ( C.) with the overflowing of which the Assyrian is compared. H.  
**8** *Wings.* Or troops.—*Emmanuel.* Christ was born in the country, and Lord of it: though it might be said to belong to the son of Isaias, as being his figure. C.  
**9** *Overcome.* The defeat of Sennacherib, of the Idumeans, &c. under Ezechias, is intimated. 4 K. 18:8 and 19:35.  
**10** **Ver** **.** **10** **.** *God.* Heb. “Emmanuel.” We have a pledge of God’s protection.  
**12** *Conspiracy.* In despair, they wish to submit to the enemy. v. 6. Isaias exhorts them to have recourse rather to the Lord. C.  
**14** **V** **er.** **14** **.** *Two.* The wicked of both kingdoms, ( H.) who choose to revolt from God. Many of Israel were led into captivity, and the territory of Juda was laid waste. C.  
**16** *Disciples.* Let some faithful witnesses keep this prophecy, ( H.) that when it is verified, all may be convinced.  
**17** *Jacob.* Having resolved on their ruin. C.  
**18** *I and my two children.* C. 7:3 and 8:4. H.—The actions of some were prophetical. C. 20:2. Os. 12:10. C.—God announces what will happen, by the names of my children, ( H.) and by their age, as well as by my mouth. C.  
**19** *Seek of pythons.* That is, people pretending to tell future things by a prophesying spirit.—*Should not the people seek of their God, for the living of the dead?* Here is signified, that it is to God we should pray to be directed, and not to seek of the *dead*, (that is, of fortune-tellers dead in sin) for the health of the living. Ch.—*Mutter.* Lit. “use a shrill note,” *strident.* H.—so Horace, (1 Sat. viii.) says—  
**20** *Law.* Sealed, (v. 16) or to the law of Moses. Eccli. 34:28. C.—Sept. “why do they consult the dead concerning the living? For he gave the law to assist us.” H.—*Light.* They shall die or be miserable. C.  
**21** *By it.* The word of God. H.—*God. Elohim* means also princes or idols. C.—Whether they seek God unwillingly, or the aid of men, (v. 22) they shall perish. W.

## Chapter 9

**1** *Loaded.* Theglathphalassar took away whole tribes, (2 Par. 5:2–6) the year after this. Yet these people were the first enlightened with the rays of the gospel, (Matt. 4:13) though so much despised. Jo. 7:52. C.—Here Christ preached first. But after his passion, few Jews believed in him. W.  
**2** *Risen.* the kingdom of Juda hoped for redress, when they saw the people of Israel humbled, ( H.) or rather after the defeat of Sennacherib. C.  
**3** *And hast.* Parkhurst says it should be, “(whom) thou hast not brought up (the Gentiles) with joy they,” &c. Symmachus) H.—The numerous forces of the Assyrians could not save them from the angel. Under Ezechias the people increased. Was not his reign a figure of the Church persecuted and increasing: but on that account, in danger from a relaxation of discipline? Lu. 5:5.—*Spoils.* They shall return thanks to God for the unexpected liberation.  
**4** *Oppressor.* Who levied taxes for Assyria. 4 K. 18:7. Sennacherib made war, because Ezechias refused to pay them any longer, and his troops fell upon each other, ( C.) as the Madianites had done. Judg. 7. H.  
**5** *Fire.* Being cut and useless. See Diss. on the defeat of Sennacherib. C.  
**6** *Child.* The Messias, whom the son of Isaias prefigured.—*Shoulder.* Where the badges of royalty were worn. C.—Christ bore his cross. Tert. &c.—*Wonderful.* In his birth, &c.—*Counsellor.* From whom all good advice proceeds. Grotius falsely translates, “the consulter of the strong God,” meaning Ezechias. Though he deemed the Socinians unworthy of the Christian name, (Ep. ad Valleum.) he too often sides with them. *Johets* always means one who “gives counsel.” C. 40:13. Ezechias was at this time ten years old, and he did not always take advice, nor was his reign peaceful, &c.—*God.* The three Greek versions maliciously render El “the strong,” though it be uncertain that it ever has that meaning, as it certainly has not when joined with *gibbon*, “mighty.” Why should two terms of the same import be used? The Sept. copies vary much. Some read only, “he shall be called the angel of the great council, for I will bring peace upon the princes and his health.” S. Jerom thinks they were afraid to style the child God. But this reason falls to the ground, as other copies have, ( C.) after *council*, “Wonderful, Counsellor, God, the Mighty, the Potent, εξουσιασζης, the Prince of Peace, the Father of the world to come, for, &c. (7.) His.” Grabe (de Vitiis lxx. p. 29.) asserts that the former is the genuine version, and that the inserted titles are a *secondary* one; so that there must have been two version before the days of Aquila, as the text is thus quoted at large by Clement and S. Iræneus, A. 180; Kennicott adds also by S. Ignatius, A. 110. H.—The omnipotent God became a little child, and without violence subdued the world, which he still governs. W.  
**7** *Peace.* Christ gives it, and propagates his Church. Heb. 12:2.  
**8** *Word.* Sept. “death.” This also agrees with the Heb. term, and with the context.  
**9** *Cedars.* They speak in a proverbial way, that they will shortly repair the injuries done by the Assyrians depending on king Osee.  
**11** *Him.* Israel. Salmanasar came to ruin the kingdom. C.  
**12** *Still.* God punishes the impenitent throughout eternity. v. 12 c. 10:4. W.  
**14** *Him.* Heb. “the branch and the rush.” C.—Sept. “the great and the small.”  
**16** *Headlong.* If the blind lead the blind, both fall into the ditch. Matt. 15:14. H.  
**17** *Folly.* Sin. They are all guilty. He will shew no compassion.  
**18** *High.* All shall witness the fall of Israel, ( C.) like a forest on fire. H.  
**19** *Brother.* Civil wars shall rage. 4 K. 15. Josephus (Bel. vii.) perhaps alluded to this passage, when he said, that an ancient prophecy announced ruin to the Jews, when they should turn their arms against each other. C.  

---

## Chapter 10

**1** *Injustice.* These great ones excite God’s indignation. C.—Jeroboam forbidding any to go to Jerusalem; and the Pharisees establishing their wicked traditions, ruined all. W.  
**3** *Af* *ar.* When Salmanasar shall come from Ninive to destroy Samaria, to punish the people for their idolatry ( C.) and oppressions. H.—*Glory.* Golden calves, (Ose. 8:5 and 10:5) or possessions. C. 9:8.  
**5** *Woe.* Or come on, *Heus*, though ( C.) ho is ordinarily rendered, alas! It here indicates that God makes use of this scourge with regret, and will afterwards consign it to the flames. H.—The prophet speaks of Salmanasar, or of Sennacherib. S. Cyr. S. Jer.  
**6** *Deceitful.* Heb. “hypocritical,” joining my worship with that of idols. C.—They had solemnly promised to serve the Lord. Ex. 19:8. W.  
**7** *So.* He will not think that he is executing my vengeance, supposing that he conquers by his own power.  
**9** *As.* Lit. “altogether kings.” H.—Thus Nabuchodonosor kept the conquered princes for derision. Hab. 1:10. Judg. 1:7.—*Arphad*, Arad, or rather Raphanæ. Jer. 49:23.—*Damascus.* These two cities were not yet subdued.  
**10** *Idols.* He looks upon the true God as no better than any idols, (4 K. 18:32) and falsely supposes that the latter were adored in Jerusalem. C.  
**12** *Works.* Humbling and terrifying Ezechias and his subjects, who were reduced to great distress, in order to avert the impending war. H.—*Eyes.* The Assyrians were punished in their turn.  
**14** *Nest.* Some put these words in the mouth of God. Tert. Abdias 4.—But they shew the insolence of Sennacherib.  
**15** *Axe.* The Assyrian has no right to boast. What can man do without God’s assistance? C.—*Gratiæ tuæ deputo et quæcumque non feci mala* *.* S. Aug. Conf. ii. 7.—Sennacherib persecuted the Jews of his own free will, though he was God’s instrument. W.  
**16** *Fire.* The Jews assert, that 185,000 perished by an inward burning, so that only ten men were left. v. 19. S. Jer.  
**17** *Light.* God. H.—*Thorns.* Private soldiers. C.  
**18** *Glory.* Officers.—*Flesh.* Or body. All shall perish. H.—*Fear.* Sennacherib escaped alone, and fell by the sword of his own sons.  
**20** *Israel* now submitted to Ezechias, as their kingdom was overturned in the sixth year of his reign, eight years before Sennacherib’s arrival. Isaias speaks of this time, and therefore makes no distinction of the kingdoms. *Striketh* the Assyrian.  
**22** *Converted.* This was partly verified in the children of Israel who remained after the devastations of the Assyrians, in the time of king Ezechias: and partly in the conversion of a remnant of the Jews to the faith of Christ. Ch.—4 K. 18:3. Rom. 9:27. The apostle follows the Sept. ( C.) “and if the people of Israel be.”—*Converted.* Sept. “saved, for perfecting the word and abridging in justice. Because God, the Lord of hosts, will make an abridged word in the universe.” H.—As the apostle has explained this passage, “every other interpretation must cease.” S. Jer.—The few who were converted under Ezechias were a figure of those who should embrace the faith of Christ. C.—*Consumption.* That is, the *number of them cut short, and reduced to few*, shall flourish in the abundance of justice. Ch.—Heb. “the desolation is decreed, justice shall overflow.” God will treat all with rigour. Nah. 1:8. The incredulous Jews shall be rejected. v. 23. Rom. 9.  
**24** *Egypt.* He sent Rabsaces from Lachis, when he set out to meet Tharaca. 4 K. 19.  
**25** *Little.* Twenty-eight years, (Ps. 89:4) or he alludes to the destruction which took place in a single night, ( C.) or in a moment. v. 16. H.  
**26** *O* *reb.* Judg. 7:25.—*And his.* Moses thus let loose the waters of the Red Sea on the Egyptians, by stretching forth his rod. C.  
**27** *Oil.* That is, by the sweet unction of divine mercy. Ch.—Chal. “before the anointed,” in consideration of Ezechias and Isaias. In the higher sense, it denotes the victory of Christ over the devil. C.  
**28** *Into Aiath*, &c. Here the prophet describes the march of the Assyrians under Sennacherib; and the terror they should carry with them; and how they should suddenly be destroyed. Ch.  
**29** *Lodging.* Here, say the Assyrians, we will encamp.  
**31** *Take.* Prot. “gather themselves to flee.” H.  
**32** *Nobe* *.* He may arrive thither shortly, in the environs of Jerusalem. C.—Sept. “exhort to-day, that they may continue on the road. Comfort with the hand the daughter of Sion, thou rock and hills within Jerusalem.” H.—*Hand.* As Nicanor did against the temple. 2 Mac. 15:32. C.  
**33** *Vessel.* Like Gideon, when he attacked Madian. v. 26. Judg. 7:19. Sept. “the nobles.” H.—Heb. “their beauty.” The empire of Assyria shall presently fall. C.

## Chapter 11

**1** *Root.* Juda shall not be exterminated, like the Assyrians. C.—Christ shall spring from the blessed Virgin, ( W.) for the salvation of mankind. The Jews agree, that this prediction regards the Messias; though some, with Grotius, would explain it literally of Ezechias. They do not reflect that he was now ten years old, and that the prophet speaks of an event which should still take place after he had been a long while upon the throne. If we were to look for any figure of the Messias, to whom this might be applicable, it would be Zorobabel. Zac. 3:8. But how disproportionate would be the promises to the execution? Some passages may indeed relate to the return of the captives, (v. 11) as the people must have a more immediate object, to insure the accomplishment of the more elevated predictions concerning the Messias: but these also refer ultimately to the propagation of the gospel, which the prophet had also in view. C.  
**2** *Him.* In the form of a dove. Jo. 1:32. H.—“The whole fountain of the Holy Ghost descending.” Ev. Nazar. S. Jer.—Christ was filled with his seven gifts, and *of his fullness* his servants *receive.* W.—Yet all virtues are the gifts of the holy Spirit, and the number seven is not specified in Hebrew, as the same word ( C.) *yirath*, is rendered *godliness*, which (v. 3) means, *the fear of the Lord.* H.—God enables us to penetrate the difficulties of Scripture, and to act with prudence, &c. M.  
**3** *Filled.* Heb. “breath *or* smell.” So S. Paul says, (2 Cor. 2:15) *we are the good odour of Christ.* C.—Prot. “he shall make him of quick understanding (marg. smell) in the fear,” &c. H.—*Ears.* Which are often deceived. M.  
**4** *Wicked.* Antichrist, (2 Thess. 2:8) and all impiety, by means of the apostles.  
**5** *Reins.* He shall possess these virtues, performing his promises with the strictest fidelity. C.  
**6** *Wolf.* Some explain this of the Millennium. ap. S. Jer. Lact. vii. 24.—But the more intelligent understand, that the fiercest nations shall embrace the gospel, and kings obey the pastors of the Church. C.—*Lead.* Or “drive,” as the word is used by Festus. H.  
**8** Basilisk*.* Ps. 9:13. The apostles subdued kings and philosophers, without any human advantages.  
**9** *Kill.* The most inveterate pagans, being once converted, entirely alter their manners. Ose. 2:18.  
**10** *Ensign.* the cross is the standard of Christians.—*Sepulchre.* Heb. Sept. &c. “rest.” S. Jerom give the true sense. The holy places have been greatly reverenced, and Christian princes strove for a long time to recover them. C.—They are respected even by the Turks. Christ’s death was ignominious, but his monument was full of glory. Thus the saints begin to shine, where the glory of the wicked ends. W.  
**11** *Time.* After the deliverance from Sennacherib, they shall return from captivity. Ezechias recalled some few. 2 Par. 29:9.—*Remnant.* Some embraced the gospel. Rom. 2:2. Acts 2:41. &c.—*Phetros*, in Egypt.—*Of the* Mediterranean *sea*, and all places to which the Jews went by water.  
**13** *Away.* Under Ezechias the Israelites began to join with Juda. But they did it more cordially after their return from Babylon.  
**14** *Shoulders.* Or confines. Ezec. 25:9. Ezechias and the Machabees attacked the Philistines. C.—Sept. “and they shall fly on the ships of the strangers; they shall plunder the sea together, and those on the east, and Idumea.” H.—*East.* Ammonites, &c. often defeated by the Machabees, and probably by Ezechias.  
**15** *Tongue.* Gulf of the Mediterranean, near Pelusium, or the seven mouths of the *river* Nile. The country was ravaged by Sennacherib, Cambyses, Alex. and Epiphanes. C. 19:4. &c. The Jewish captives shall return thence. C. 50:3. Zac. 10:10.  
**16** *Assyrians.* They shall march without impediment. C.  

---

## Chapter 12

**1** *Thanks.* Lit. “confess.” The Jews thank God for their return, as the Church does for her deliverance from sin. W.—Canticles were composed on such occasions. Ex. 15.—*Angry.* They do not thank God on this account; but because he had averted his indignation. C.  
**3** *Fountains.* Instead of those which your fathers drank in the desert. C.—You shall have the holy Scriptures, ( H.) sacraments, &c. Jo. 4:13 and 7:38.  
**6** *Of thee.* He alludes to the name Emmanuel. Christ preached, and *his own* would not receive him. Jo. 1:11 and 26. C.—He continues with us, concealed under the sacramental species. M.  

---

## Chapter 13

**1** *Burden.* That is, a prophecy against Babylon. Ch.—Nimrod began the kingdom. Gen. 10. Belus and Ninus brought it to great eminence. But after 1240 years, Babylon was taken by Cyrus. W.—Isaias delivered the seven following chapters in the first year of Ezechias. C. 14:28.  
**2** *Mountain* of Media, whence Darius came. It was usual to erect a signal, (c. 30:17. Jer. 6:1) to call troops together. C.  
**3** *Sanctioned.* The Medes and Persians were appointed by God to punish Babylon. W.  
**4** *Kings.* Darius styles himself king of the Medes and Persians. Dan. 6:12. Many princes and nations composed his army.  
**5** *Heaven.* Where it seems to touch the horizon. Thus the countries beyond the Euphrates are often designated.  
**6** *Near.* Though one hundred and seventy-two years distant.  
**8** *Burnt.* Black with despair. Nah. 2:10 and Joel 2:6.  
**9** *Desolate.* This was effected in the course of many centuries. C.—The building of Seleucia caused Babylon to be deserted. Pliny vi. 27.—Hence we know not at present where it was situated.  
**10** *Stars.* This is not to be taken literally, but only implies that the people shall be in as much consternation ( C.) as if the world were at an end. v. 13. H. Grot. Mat. 24:27. Apoc. 6:12. Jer. 4:23.  
**11** *World.* The vices of all nations were concentrated at Babylon. C.  
**12** *Precious.* Rare, ( W.) or sought after for destruction. v. 17.  
**13** *Heaven.* With thunders.  
**14** *Land.* Baltassar shall be abandoned by his allies. Crœsus had been already defeated, before Cyrus invested Babylon.  
**17** *Medes.* Who had set themselves at liberty about twenty years before this. They were not solicitous about gold. Ezec. 7:19. Soph. 1:18.  
**19** *Gomorrha.* Towards the end of the Macedonian empire. C.—The Persians kept wild beasts in it. S. Jer.—The palace of Nabuchodonosor subsisted in the days of Benjamin, ( C.) but could not be approached on account of serpents. Tudel. p. 70.  
**20** *Tents.* To dwell, ( C.) or to traffic. Theod.—Another city was built, but not so large, nor in the same place. W.  
**21** *Beasts.* Heb. tsiim, “fishermen.”—*Serpents* *.* Heb. ochim. Sept. “echo,” ( H.) or “reeds.” Babylon was built on a marshy situation, and Cyrus having *let out* the waters of the Euphrates, they could never be effectually stopped.—*Ostriches.* Or swans.—*Hairy.* Goats. C. 34:14. C.  
**22** *Owls.* Or jackals, which resemble foxes, and going in packs, will devour the largest creatures. Bochart. Parkhurst in *aje.* H.—But S. Jer. explains it of birds. Job 28:7. Lev. 14.—*Sirens*, fabulously supposed to be sweet singing women with wings.—*Thannim* denotes some great sea monsters, such as whales or sea calves. C.  

---

## Chapter 14

**1** *Prolonged.* Babylon was taken one hundred and seventy-two years after. C.—Yet this time is counted short, compared with the monarchy, which had lasted a thousand years. W.—*Ground.* Cyrus restored the Jews; yet all did not return at that time.—*Stranger.* Converts. Est. 8:17. All Idumea received circumcision under Hyrcan.  
**2** *Place.* Cyrus probably granted an escort, as Artaxerxes did. 2 Esd. 2:7.—*Servants.* They had purchased many slaves, (1 Esd. 2:65) as some were very rich in captivity, and were treated like other subjects.—*Oppressors.* Stragglers of the army of Cambyses, &c. though this was chiefly verified under the Machabees. Jer. 25:14 and 30:16. C.  
**4** *Parable.* Sept. θρηνον. “Lamentation.” H.—Or mournful canticle.  
**6** *Persecuted.* The Jews read incorrectly, “is persecuted.”  
**7** *Earth.* Subject to, or bordering upon the Assyrian empire. Under Darius the Mede, (the Cyaxares of Xenophon) and Cyrus, the people were little molested. C.—The neighbouring princes (*fir-trees*, &c. v. 8) were also at rest. H.  
**9** *Hell* is personified, deriding the Chaldee monarch, Baltassar, who perished the very night after he had profaned the sacred vessels. Dan. 5:3. He probably received only the burial of an ass. v. 11. 19. C.  
**12** *O Lucifer.* O day-star. All this, according to the letter, is spoken of the king of Babylon. It may also be applied, in a spiritual sense, to Lucifer, the prince of devils, who was created a bright angel, but fell by pride and rebellion against God. Ch. Lu. 10:18. C.—He fell by pride, as Nabuchodonosor did. W.—Homer (Iliad xix.) represents the demon of discord hurled down by Jupiter to the miserable region of mortals.  
**13** *North.* And be adored as God in the temple of Jerusalem. Ps. 47:3. The Assyrian and Persian monarchs claimed divine honours. 4 K. 18:33. Judith 3:13.  
**15** *Depth.* Heb. “sides,” (v. 13) or holes dug out of a cavern. C.  
**16** *Turn.* From their respective holes in the monument.  
**19** *Grave.* Strangers seized the crown of Baltassar, and neglected his sepulchre: or if we explain it of Nabuchodonosor, his tomb was probably plundered, ( C.) as the Persians did not spare that of Belus. In the reign of Alexander, the tombs of the kings were covered with water, and filled with serpents. Arrian. vii.  
**20** *Thy.* Sept. “my.” Thou hast been a murderer instead of a shepherd.—*Ever.* The children and monarchy of Nabuchodonosor presently perished. Evilmerodac and Baltassar reigned but a short time, and left no issue to inherit the throne.  
**22** *Name.* It shall lose all its splendour, and be mentioned only with abhorrence. 1 Pet. 5:13.  
**23** *Besom.* Reducing it to a heap of rubbish, (C. 13:21. C.) as the event shewed. Watson.  
**25** *Assyrian.* 4 K. 19. W.—Sennacherib, (S. Jer.) Cambyses, or Holofernes. The sight of their chastisement would ben an earnest of the fall of Babylon. C.—The allies of Assyria, ( M.) or the enemies of God’s people, will also be punished. C. 15. H.  
**28** *Achaz.* When Ezechias was just seated on the throne. The preceding and subsequent predictions were then delivered. C. 13:20.  
**29** *Rod.* Achaz.—*Bird.* Ezechias will openly attack thee. 4 K. 18:8. C.—Prot. “*sh* *all be* a fiery flying serpent,” ( H.) like that erected by Moses. Num. 21:9. Sennacherib and Assaraddon shall lay waste Philistia. v. 31 c. 20:1. C.—Though Achaz be dead, Ezechias and Ozias will destroy more of that nation. 4 K. 18:8 and 2 Par. 26. W.  
**32** *Nations.* Surprised that Ezechias should escape, while the power of the Philistines was overturned so easily; or when the king sent ambassadors to his allies, to announce the defeat of Sennacherib by the angel. All confessed that this was an effect of the divine protection towards Sion. C.

## Chapter 15

**1** *Moab.* Which would be visited in three years’ time (c. 16:14) either by Ezechias, or by Sennacherib, though history be silent on this head. The Moabites had been very crue., Amos 1 and 2.—*Night.* Suddenly. C.—Their misery was so much the greater. W.—*Ar.* The capital. C.  
**2** *House.* Prot. “he is come up to Baith,” ( H.) or the royal family is gone to the temple of their idol, Chamos, to lament. S. Jer. M. C.—*Shaven.* As in mourning. Jer. 48:37.  
**4** *Itself.* Every one shall deplore his own distress.  
**5** *My.* A charitable heart will grieve for the misfortune of an enemy. W.—I shall join in the general lamentations, though Moab has always been so great an enemy of Israel. C.—Sept. “the heart of Moab cries in itself to Segor.” H.—We will retire thither. Chal.—*Bars.* Princes. Prot. “his fugitives *shall*,” &c.—*Heifer.* Strong and ungovernable. Heb. “to Heglath and to Shelishia for,” &c. though we may as well adhere to the Vulg. Sept. &c.  
**6** *Nemrim* *.* Or Nemra, (Num. 32:3) to the north of Segor. C.—The country around hence became barren. S. Jer.  
**7** *Willows.* That is, as some say, the waters of Babylon; others render it a valley of the Arabians, ( Ch.) or “of crows,” to which their bodies will be exposed. C. 57:6.  
**8** *Cry.* Of iniquity, or rather of grief.  
**9** *Dibon.* Sept. &c. read, “Dimon,” which signifies, “blood.” I will give it a better claim to this appellation.—*Lion.* Nabuchodonosor. C.—Sept. “I will bring the Arabs up on Dimon, and will take away the seed of Moab, and Ariel, and the remnant of Adama.” H.

## Chapter 16

**1** Petra. Heb. selah, “the rock.” H.—Our Saviour spring from Ruth, the Moabitess. M.—The original may insinuate, that the king of the country had neglected to pay the usual tribute to Juda. 4 K. 3:4. C.—“Send the lamb to the ruler,” &c. Tournemine. Amid scenes of distress, the prophet perceives that the Saviour will proceed from one of this nation. W.  
**2** Arnon. They shall not be able to fly over, or to escape the conqueror.  
**3** *Night.* Seek a retreat in the darkest places; or protect Israel when they shall flee before the Assyrians. Their cruelty is thus insinuated. Amos 1.  
**4** *Dust.* Theglathphalassar. I need not exhort you to receive my people, as I know your dispositions, and they are out of danger. C.  
**5** *Just.* This regards Christ, (S. Jer.) prefigured by ( H.) Ezechias. C.  
**7** *Walls.* Heb. “Kir-hareseth.” C. 15:1. H.  
**8** *Lords.* Princes of Jerusalem, (Lam. 1:1) or of Assyria. C.—*Sea.* Of Sodom, even as far as Jazer, ( H.) in the tribe of Ruben. C.  
**9** *My tears.* C. 15:5. H.—I announce a different sort of music from that which is customary in times of harvest, and of vintage. The liquor shall be tears. C. 63:2. Jer. 48:32. 33. C.  
**10** *Car* *mel.* This name is often taken to signify a fair and fruitful hill or field, such as Mount Carmel is. Ch.—It means, “the vine of God.” C.  
**11** *Wall.* Kir-hareseth. v. 7. I am grieved at your misfortunes. C.  
**12** *Prevail.* Chamos shall not be able to help them.  
**13** *That time.* A long while ago. Ps. 92:2.  
**14** *Not many.* It was laid waste in the third year of Ezechias. But its final destruction took place only five years after that of Jerusalem. C.—The wars against Moab continued three years, after which it was reduced to servitude. W.  

---

## Chapter 17

**1** *Damascus.* When it was taken by Theglathphalassar, or rather by Sennacherib. C. 10:8. It was again ruined by Nabuchodonosor. Jer. 49:24. But after the first taking, it never regained its power. *Magni nominis umbra* *.* C.  
**2** *Aroer.* Chal. “abandoned, shall be folds for sheep.” Sept. “left for ever a resting place for flocks and herds, and none shall pursue.” The tribes on the east of the Jordan shall be led captive, as well as those on the west, Ephraim, &c. H.  
**3** *Damascus.* Their too great union proved their ruin. Sennacherib took Damascus, as Salmanasar had done Samaria.  
**4** *Lean.* All the power of the kingdom shall fail, as in a mortal illness.  
**5** Raphaim*.* Near Jerusalem. 3 K. 21:13. Sept. “of stones.” C.—It will be equally difficult to find any men left in the kingdom of Israel. H.  
**7** *Israel.* They obeyed the summons of Ezechias and of Josias, (2 Par. 30:1 and 34:6) and every after followed the same worship as Juda. C.  
**9** *Left.* By the Chanaanites, when the children of Israel came into their land. Ch.—Their consternation was become proverbial. Jos. 2:9 and 5:11.  
**10** *Good.* Sept. “fruitless.” Israel had abandoned the Lord; and could expect nothing but the fruits of death. C.  
**11** *Much.* Thou hast laboured earnestly, but reaped no benefit. H.  
**12** *Multitude*, &c. This and all that follows to the end of the chapter, relates to the Assyrian army under Sennacherib, ( Ch.) or rather to that of Israel and its allies. C.—After the Assyrians had afflicted Israel, they were also punished. W.  
**14** *Not be.* Phacee and Rasin were presently exterminated.—*Spoiled us.* The kingdom of Achaz. 4 K. 17:5.  

---

## Chapter 18

**1** *Cymbal.* Or *sistrum*, commonly used in Egypt. Sept. “ship sails.”—*Ethiopia*, or Chus, lying between the Nile (the branches of which are styled *rivers*) and the Red Sea. He alludes to the kingdom of Tharaca. 4 K. 19:8. C.  
**2** *Ambassadors.* Heb. “images,” (Bochart) in honour of Adonis; (S. Cyr.) or rather Ezechias, or Tharaca send to demand troops. C.—*Bulrushes.* Lit. “paper.” H.—Formed of rushes which grow on the banks of the Nile. Pliny vii. 56. and xiii. 11.—*Angels.* Or messengers.—*Pieces.* With factions after the death of Sabacon, or by the inroads of Sennacherib.—*Other.* He derides the vanity of the Egyptians. C.—*Expecting* the overflowing of the Nile. H.—Heb. “of line,” ( C.) with which they marked out each person’s property, after the waters had subsided. Strabo 17.—*Foot.* They worked their dough with their feet, and sent swine to trample on the seed, which required no more cultivation. Herod. ii. 14. and 36.—*Spoiled.* The Nile made considerable alterations.  
**4** *Place* *.* God rules all with ease.—*Harvest.* The allies shall comfort my people, ( C.) or Sennacherib shall threaten ruin. H.—But I will frustrate his evil designs. His army shall perish unexpectedly. v. 5. C.—The Egyptians had sent messengers to assure the Israelites that they would come to assist them: but the prophet informs them of their own ruin. W.  
**6** *Them.* Their bodies shall lie unburied.  
**7** *Sion.* Egypt shall send presents to the Lord. 2 Par. 32:23. C.  

---

## Chapter 19

**1** *Egypt.* Many refer this to the coming of Christ, ( C.) at whose presence the idols fell down, and many saints adorned the country. W.—But the prophet may also literally refer to the wars of the Assyrians against Egypt. Sabacon having retired, after reigning fifty years, Anysis, and afterwards the priest of Sethon, succeeded to the throne. The latter was attacked by Sennacherib. After his death, twelve kingdoms were formed, but Psammitichus reunited them, and had Nechao for his successor. Herod. ii. 141. 158.—*Behold.* The prophet speaks fourteen years before the attack of Sennacherib.—*Cloud.* Ps. 17:11. Some Fathers explain it of the blessed Virgin. C.—*Moved.* Plundered by the Assyrians. M.  
**2** *Kingdom.* Under the twelve kings. C.  
**3** *Egypt.* Sept. “of the Egyptians shall be troubled within them.” H.—*Soothsayers.* Feeble but too common resource of superstitious people!  
**4** *Masters.* Twelve kings. Psammitichus, one of them, shall gain the ascendancy.  
**5** *Dry.* The lakes and the Nile shall not afford sufficient moisture. C.—If the Nile rose less than twelve or more than sixteen cubits famine ensued. Pliny xviii. 18.  
**7** *Fountain.* The Nile rises in Ethiopia. But the canals alone were left dry. C.—Sept. “the achi, every green herb along the river, and every,” &c. H.  
**8** *Fishers.* The lake Mœris produced a talent every day for the revenue, and so great was the abundance of fish, that they could hardly be salted. The Nile was also well supplied with fish.  
**9** *Linen.* Gr. “silk.” Ezec. 16:10. C.  
**10** *All they.* Sept. “and all who make strong drink (*secer*) shall be in sorrow, and shall afflict their souls.” H.—This version is perhaps the best, as the Egyptians used much ale or wine distilled from barley. C.  
**11** *Tanis.* Or of the twelve kings. v. 1. They are disconcerted at the approach of Psammitichus, ( C.) or at the want of water. H.  
**13** *Memphis.* The seat of many kings, and a very ancient city. Heb. “Hoph.”—*Stay.* Lit. “angle,” denoting the chiefs, or all the land. Judg. 20:2.  
**15** *Back.* King and subject are equally confused. C. 9:14. C.  
**17** *Terror.* Hebrew also, “a rejoicing,” (S. Jer.) on account of Sennacherib’s defeat there. C. 18:7.  
**18** Chanaan. Hebrew. The Israelites had a connection with Egypt, which the prophets often blame. C. 30:2. Ezechias trusted in their aid, when he refused to pay tribute to the Assyrians. Many at that time, or afterwards, retired thither, and served God unmolested. C. 11:2. Jer. 42. More established themselves in the country under Alexander and the Ptolemies. 3 Mac. 8. But this prediction was more fully accomplished by the propagation of the Christian religion. Grace no where shone forth more brightly than in this country, once the seat of superstition.—*Sun.* Heb. “of desolation.” But the copies have varied. It is supposed to denote the city On. Gen. 41:45. C.—Prideaux (p. 2. b. 4.) accuses the Jews of willfully corrupting this text in the Sept. Kennicott.  
**19** *A* *ltar.* If the Jews were forbidden to have any other than the one at Jerusalem, how can the prophet announce this as a blessing? Onias being excluded from the high priesthood, retired into Egypt, and obtained leave to build the temple Onion, in the Nome, though not in the city of Helipolis, above Bubaste, on the Nile, alleging that Isaias had foretold this event, and that one was already built at Leontopolis. Jos. Ant. xii. 15. and xiii. 6.—But we must allow with the fathers and Jews in the days of S. Jerom, that this prediction regarded the Messias, when altars might be lawfully erected in every nation. See Misna, tr. Moneuth, xiii. 10.—*Monument.* The cross is set up wherever Christ is adored. C.—The Egyptians shall embrace Christianity, and Anthony, &c. shall live a holy ( W.) and austere life. H.  
**20** *Them.* The Jews were miraculously rescued from the hands of Philopater, (c. Ap. ii.) or rather Christians are delivered from sin and Satan.  
**21** *Egypt.* The kings often caused sacrifices to be offered for them; but they were not acceptable, as long as they continued idolaters. The country was converted to Christianity, ( C.) and the Anchorets performed their vows and penitential exercises, to the admiration of all. H.  
**22** *Scourge.* By means of Sennacherib, Cambyses, and Ochus. Afterwards the country was quietly subject to the kings of Persia, Alex. the Ptolemies, and the Romans. C.  
**24** *Land.* The apostles, who were true Israelites, ( H.) procured the blessing of faith for these nations, ( C.) to serve God with concord. H.  

---

## Chapter 20

**1** *Year.* Eighteen after the preceding predictions. C.—*Sargon.* Sennacherib, (S. Jer.) Salmanasar, (Sanct.) or Assaradon, who intended to revenge Sennacherib, and sent his “collector of taxes” to take Azotus from Ezechias, and then to proceed farther. C.—Psammitichus having obtained the sole dominion of Egypt, besieged Azotus for 29 years. Herod. ii. 157. Amos 1:8.  
**2** *Sackcloth.* The prophets lived in poverty. Zac. 13:4. Their persons were prophetic. It is not agreed whether Isaias went quite naked, or only without his upper garment. The former supposition would represent better the condition of slaves, (v. 4) and is adopted by S. Jerom, &c. C.—People are said to be naked when they are almost so. 2 K. 6. Jo. 21. H.—Yet “nothing is more *honest* than to obey God.” S. Jer. W.  
**3** *Years.* Isaias went so long, or perhaps only three days undressed. Num. 14:34. Ezec. 4:5. Egypt and the Arabian Ethiopia were to be abandoned to the Assyrians, in or during three years.  
**4** *Shame.* Thus captives were generally exposed to sale. C. 47:2. Nah. 3:5.  
**5** *Glory.* The alliance of these nations shall not avail the Jews, who are said to inhabit an *island*, because they neglected God’s service no less than the most distant and abandoned nations. C.—The changes in empires must convince us to depend only on God, since Damascus and Egypt could not save the Hebrews, nor even themselves. W.  

---

## Chapter 21

**1** *The desert of the sea.* So Babylon is here called, because from a city as full of people as the sea is with water, it was become a desert. Ch.—After its fall, it was mostly inundated. C. 13:20.—*Land.* Media and Persia, which lay to the south, and were not so beautiful as the environs of Babylon.  
**2** *Spoileth* *.* Baltassar is incorrigible, or his opponents must proceed. C.—*Elam;* that is, O Persia: ( Ch.) Cyrus, and Darius, the *Mede.* C.—The former nation was weak, and the latter strong. W.—*Cease.* The enemy will shew no pity; nor shall I; as Babylon did not heretofore. H.  
**3** *Pain.* He bewails the crimes and the fall of Babylon, which at this time was in amity with Ezechias. v. 10. C.  
**4** *Babylon.* Prot. “the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.” Sept. “My soul is turned into fear.” H.  
**5** *Drink.* Persians refresh yourselves.—*Take up.* Heb. “anoint.” He may also allude to the Babylonians, who were feasting.  
**7** *Camel.* These two riders are the kings of the Persians and Medes. Ch.—The sentinel, placed by Isaias, in spirit, or rather by the king of Babylon, brings these tidings. C.  
**8** *Out.* Lit. “He cried, a lion.” H.—Cyrus appears like one. Sept. “And call Urias to the watch-tower,” &c. C. 8:2.  
**9** *Horsemen*, drawn by the ass and camel. v. 7. This was verified long after.  
**10** *Floor:* you who must shortly be reduced to the utmost distress. Baladan was friendly to Ezechias. But Assaradon having seized Babylon, took Manasses prisoner; and the city thenceforward continued to fill up the measure of its sins. C.  
**11** Duma. That is, Idumea, or Edom. Ch.—It was a city of that country, twenty miles from Eleutheropolis. S. Jer.—Assaradon desolated Idumea the following year. v. 16. The Jews absurdly apply to Rome what is said of Edom. S. Jer. C.  
**12** *Night.* Instead of joy, I must announce dreadful things. H.  
**13** *Arabia.* This sentence is not in the Rom. ( C.) or Alex. Sept. ( H.) and Dedan is a city of Idumea. C.—The Israelites are threatened. W.  
**14** *Water.* To neglect this was to be accessary to another’s death, in those dreary regions. C. 16:3. Deut. 23:2.  
**16** *Hireling;* counting precisely. C. 16:14. C.—*Cedar:* Arabia, ( Ch.) near to Edom. C.  

---

## Chapter 22

**1** *The valley of vision:* Jerusalem. The temple of Jerusalem was built upon Mount Moria, or on the mountain *of vision.* But the city is here called, *the valley of vision*, either because it was lower than the temple, or because of the low condition to which it was to be reduced, ( Ch.) during the captivity. W.—*Vision.* Sept. “Sion.” H.—This prophecy regards the devastation caused by Sennacherib, (S. Jer.) Nabuchodonosor, (Sanct.) the Romans, (Eus.) or by Assaradon, when he took Manasses. 2 Par. 33:11 and 4 K. 21:10.—*Tops*, to weep.  
**2** *Battle.* He taxes the king with cowardice.  
**4** **Ver** **.** **4** **.** *People.* He saw this in spirit, though he might not live to witness it. C.  
**5** *Searching.* That day beheld the Assyrians ( H.) undermining the wall, and behaving with haughtiness ( C.) on Mount Sion. H.  
**6** *Wall.* Arms were frequently hung thereon. Cant. 5:14. C.  
**8** *Covering.* Heb. masac, ( H.) “shade,” for the convenience of the people. 4 K. 16:18.—*Forest*, built by Solomon. Ezechias has also procured store of arms, which were now delivered out to the citizens.  
**9** *Many*, but you have neglected them, ( C.) till it be too late. H.—*Pool*, communicating with Gehon on the west. C.  
**11** *Walls.* Manasses enclosed the pool within walls, forming a *second* town. 4 K. 22:2–9.—*Ago.* You have not imitated the piety of Ezechias.  
**13** *Die.* Thus the pagans encouraged themselves to feast. C.—*Ergo vivamus dum licet esse benè* *.* Petron.—This conduct betrayed an entire want of faith. C.—“Nothing offends God so much … as contempt proceeding from despair.” S. Jer.  
**14** *Die.* The repentance of Manasses, and the piety of Josias, could not avert the storm. *Discite justitiam moniti et non temnere divos* *.*  
**15** *Temple*, in the place of Eliacim. He had been secretary before, ( C.) and had intruded himself into some office in the temple, which he abused. W.  
**17** *Cock.* S. Jerom’s master assured him that the word which is usually rendered a warrior, has this meaning. H.—The comparison agrees well with a proud man reduced to misery. C.—Heb. “With the captivity of a man, and he will cover thee.” Sept. “he will cast out and bruise the man, and will take away thy comely robe, and throw thee into,” &c. H.  
**18** *Lord;* Manasses, who hath exalted thee. C.  
**20** *Eliacim*, who had been displaced, v. 15. He acted as regent after the departure of Manasses, who always followed his counsels at his return. Judith 4:5. The priesthood was not then incompatible with civil and military functions.  
**21** *Girdle*, the badge of power. Job 12:18.  
**22** *Shoulder.* Here the marks of dignity were worn. Eliacim was appointed master of the palace, over all the other servants. C.—Thus we may gather what power Christ conferred on S. Peter, when he gave him the *keys* of heaven. Mat. 16:19. Apoc. 3:7. H.  
**23** *Peg*, on which whatever is placed shall be secure. 1 Esd. 9:8.  
**24** *House.* He shall be the ornament of the priesthood.—*Music.* All affairs in church and state shall be at his disposal.  
**25** *Fall.* Sobna shall lose all his employments, and ruin others. C.  

---

## Chapter 23

**1** *Tyre* was destroyed, in part, by Nabuchodonosor. Cyrus permitted all the captives of this, as well as of other countries, to return.—*Cethim* *;* Cyrus, or rather Macedonia. Merchants come thence no longer.  
**2** *Island.* Tyre was originally surrounded with water. A communication with the land was made afterwards. Jos. 19:29. C. Ezec. 27. W.  
**3** *Nile.* Heb. Shichor, or “muddy water,” designates that river. Jos. 13:3.—*River.* The overflowing of the Nile gave fertility to Egypt, insomuch that Tyre and other nations were supplied by it with corn.  
**4** *Strength:* people who sail. Sept. “but the strength … replied: I,” &c. Sidon will not be concerned for the fall of her rival. She alleges that she has nothing to do with Tyre. That city would not allow that it was a colony of Sidon. v. 12. C.  
**6** *Seas.* The rich Tyrians did so. S. Jer.—Sept. “to Carthage.” Heb. Tharsis, is Cilicia. C.—Hence Nabuchodonosor did not find a sufficient reward. Ezec. 29:18.  
**7** *Sojourn.* Many fled, others were made captives.  
**8** *Earth.* The merchants were as rich as kings, or the latter sent their merchandise to Tyre. Ezec. 27:33.  
**10** *Girdle*, fortress; or rather, thou art naked, like a slave. C. 20:4.  
**12** *Daughter;* colony. C.—*Oppressed.* Lit. “calumniated.” H.  
**13** *It.* Hebrew adds, “for fishermen.” It was formerly covered with water. Euseb. præp. ix.—*Ruin.* The fall of Babylon has been denounced. C. 13.  
**15** *King* Nabuchodonosor, whose two sons reigned but a short time. The captivity of the people of God began also A. 3398, and ended A. 3468, the first of Cyrus.—*Harlot.* She shall be re-established, ( C.) and shall invite people to her markets. Sanchez.—Before Cyrus, she had kings, but they were of small power. The city was become very rich, and well fortified, when Alexander was stopped by it for seven months. See Ezec. 26:14. C.—Tyre had rejoiced at the misfortunes of the Hebrews, and was punished by the like captivity. W.  
**17** *Commit.* Sept. “be the emporium for all.” Great injustice prevailed formerly among merchants, so that it is represented as a dishonest calling. H.  
**18** *Sanctified to the Lord.* This alludes to the conversion of the Gentiles. Ch.—Before, the Tyrian were great enemies to the Jews. 2 Esd. 13:16 and 1 Mac. 5:15. Our Saviour wrought a miracle in favour of one of this country. Mat. 5:22. Zac. 8:20. C.—*Continuance.* Lit. “old age.” Aquila, “with changes of dress.” H.  

---

## Chapter 24

**1** *Earth.* After the ten preceding threats, the prophet denounces destruction to the whole world, ( W.) at the day of judgment; though he may also allude to the desolation of the promised land, as our Saviour joins both in the same prediction. Mat. 24. C.  
**2** *Priest.* All distinctions shall be disregarded. W.—When Jerusalem was taken, all became captives.  
**4** *Weakened:* Joakim, &c. are made prisoners. The greatest monarchs must come before God’s tribunal.  
**6** *Sin.* Towards the end of the world iniquity will abound, and men shall rage against each other. Mat. 24. W.—They will also feel the effects of sin.—*Mad:* abandoned to their passions, (Deut. 28:28) excepting only the elect. M.—*Few.* The Chaldees permitted only a few of the poorest sort to remain. 2 Par. 29:10.  
**9** *The drink.* Heb. shecar, “palm wine.”  
**10** *Vanity.* Jerusalem, ( C.) or any other city, will be all in confusion. H.—*In*, as was the case in times of mourning. Jer. 9:21. C.  
**14** *Sea.* The few elect (v. 13) being rescued from the *misery* of the world, shall praise God. H.—They are exhorted to lift up their heads. Lu. 21:28. M.  
**15** *Instruction.* The Church is like an island, compared with the rest of the world; or it preaches the gospel to all nations, and to the islands, like Great Britain. W.—Apostolic men are required to preach incessantly to all sorts of people. Heb. “in light;” or Pagn. “in vales.” M.  
**16** *I said.* The prophet, or any other, may speak thus in the latter days. C.—*Myself.* I cannot recount what horrid pains I beheld. S. Jer. M. 2 Cor. 12:4.  
**17** *Snare.* He alludes to the methods of taking wild beasts. Job 18:11.—*Opened*, as they were in the days of Noe. C.—All sorts of misery hang over us.  
**20** *Night*, unexpectedly, ( H.) and with the utmost speed. C.  
**21** *High.* The stars, which in many places of the Scripture are so called. Some commentators explain that these words here signify the demons of the air. Ch.—The apostate angels will be judged. 1 Cor. 6:6. Mat. 24:29.  
**22** *Visited.* Hence Origen (Prin. iii. 6. &c.) took occasion to assert, that the damned would one day be released, though the Scripture so often declares the contrary. The prophet speaks of the future liberation of the Jews; ( C.) or he intimates that *after many days*, yea throughout eternity, the reprobate will still be punished. M.  
**23** *Blush:* he turned into blood. Joel 2:10. Dreadful calamities shall ensue, to usher in the great day of judgment. C.  

---

## Chapter 25

**1** *Amen.* He approves of God’s judgments ( H.) against Jerusalem. W.  
**2** *City;* Jerusalem, or rather Babylon, (C. 21. C.) or every city ( H.) in the world. M.—*Strangers:* the temples of idols.  
**3** *People;* the Chaldees, or their conquerors.  
**4** *Poor;* Juda, whom Nabuchodonosor’s fury could not exterminate.  
**5** *Away.* Cyrus ( C.) shall reduce Babylon the great. H.  
**6** *Moun* *tain* of Sion, a figure of the Church, and of heaven. The Jews shall feast: yea, some of all nations shall partake of the blessed Eucharist, and obtain heaven. The expressions are too grand for a corruptible feast. C.—*Wine.* Lit. “of vintage,” ( H.) on which occasion great rejoicings were made. Hesiod. Hercul. 297.—Prot. “of wines on the lees.” H.—In the East, the wines were very thick. Ps. 75:9. C.—On the rejection of the Jews, the Gentiles were converted. W.  
**7** *Tied.* He will open their eyes to the truth of the gospel. They shall be no longer as criminals, expecting death, or mourning.  
**8** *Ever.* Heb. “he shall swallow up death in victory.” 1 Cor. 15:54. Christ, by dying, conquered death, and rescued us from its power, if we do not voluntarily subject ourselves to it again. This was faintly represented by the liberation of the captives.  
**10** *Mountain:* the Church. C.—*Moab.* That is, the reprobate, whose eternal punishment, from which they can no way escape, is described under these figures. Ch.—The Machabees probably executed this vengeance on Moab. 1 Mac. 5:6.  
**11** *Hands.* All his exertions and fury will prove useless. H.—Moab shall lie prostrate.  

---

## Chapter 26

**1** *Day.* Under the law of grace, Christians sing this and such like canticles. W.—*Sion.* This word is not in Heb. &c. though it be understood. C.—Other nations have their respective cities. All Christians admit this one. W.—The captives continue to return thanks. Yet the Holy Ghost speaks chiefly of the Church, and of the general resurrection. C.—*Bulwark.* Faith and good works. W.  
**2** *Truth.* The Jews who returned from Babylon, were more virtuous than their ancestors, as the prophets intimate; though they have Christians principally in view.  
**3** *Away:* condemning the virtuous, as if they were fools. M.—Sym. “our work, or fiction, is taken away.” Heb. may have other meanings. H.  
**4** *You*, people of Juda.  
**5** *High:* Nabuchodonosor and his empire.  
**6** *Needy.* The Jews shall behold the ruin of the city by Cyrus, ( C.) who was of a contemptible nation. H.  
**7** *In.* God will remove every obstacle, at their return.  
**9** *Night* of distress.  
**10** *Justice.* Clemency would therefore be ill placed. If the Israelites had not been led away captives, would they ever have been reformed?  
**11** *Not see.* Let them perish, or live to witness the glory of the Jews.  
**12** **Ve** **r.** **12** **.** *Works*, both in punishing and rewarding. C.—God crowns his own gifts. E.  
**13** *Lords* of Babylon, ( C.) and our own passions. H.  
**14** *Giants;* the proud emperors of Babylon, whom thou wilt destroy. Sept. “physicians;” as *Rephaim* has also this meaning.  
**15** *Nation* of the Jews. C.—Sept. “add evils to them, O Lord; add evils to the nobles of the land.” H.—Heb. may have the same sense.—*E* *nds:* princes, or the Chaldees, sending them also into captivity; or thou hast propagated thy Church over the world.  
**16** *They.* Sept. “We,” &c. C.—Affliction is a wholesome medicine. H.  
**18** *Wi* *nd.* Our expectation of aid from others has been disappointed. C.—Sept. “the spirit of thy salvation, which thou hast wrought on the earth. We shall not fall, but the inhabitants of the earth shall fall.” H.—Their copies must have been different from ours.—*Fallen.* The Chanaanites are left for our trial and punishment. C.  
**19** *Dead:* a civil death, shall regain their liberty; and those who have left this world in a state of virtue, shall be happy.—*Ruin.* Cyrus liberated the Jews, having conquered Babylon.  
**20** *Away*, and Cambyses be destroyed. Ezec. 38:11. C.  
**21** *Shall cover her stain* *no more.* This is said with relation to the martyrs, and their happy resurrection. Ch.—The blood of the saints shall demand vengeance. C.  

---

## Chapter 27

**1** *Hard.* Sept. “holy.” C.—*Leviathan.* That is, the devil, the great enemy of the people of God. He is called the *bar serpent* from his strength, and the *crooked serpent* from his wiles, and the *whale of the sea*, from they tyranny he exercises in the sea of this world. He was spiritually slain by the death of Christ, when his power was destroyed. Ch.—It may also literally refer to Nabuchodonosor, and the king of Egypt, or rather to Cambyses, or Holofernes, but particularly Cambyses. C.  
**2** *Vineyard;* the Church of Christ, ( Ch.) or Judea. It may be the beginning of a noted song. C.  
**3** *Drink;* or, as the Hebrew may also be rendered, I will continually water it. Ch.—God will protect his people. C.  
**4** *In me*, against the Church; nor shall I become as *a thorn* or *brier* in its regard; or *march against it*, or *set it on fire:* but it shall always *take* fast *hold of me*, and keep an everlasting *peace with me.* Ch.—God rather speaks of the enemy. If he attempt to lay waste this vineyard, I will chastise him. C.  
**6** *Rush in.* Some understand this of the enemies of the true Israel, that shall invade it in vain. Others of the spiritual invasion made by the apostles of Christ. Ch.—Prot. “He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root.” Sept. “those who come are children of Jacob.” H.  
**7** *Struck.* Hath God punished the carnal persecuting Jews, in proportion to their doings against Christ and his saints? Ch.—God punished Israel as a father: but he will destroy the Chaldees, &c. C.  
**8** *Cast off.* When the synagogue shall be cast off, thou shalt judge it in measure, and in proportion to its crimes. Ch.—The Israelites have been rigorously punished. C.—*He*, &c. God hath designed severe punishments in the day of his wrath. Ch.  
**9** *Jacob;* viz. of such of them as shall be converted. Ch.—*Altar*, dedicated to idols: then he shall obtain pardon. C.  
**10** *City.* Jerusalem, ( Ch.) or more probably Babylon, of which he is going to speak.  
**11** *Women.* The princes shall be weak and irresolute. C.—Sept. “Hither, ye women, coming from the shew. For it is not an intelligent people.”  
**12** *River* Euphrates, even to the Nile. H.—Nabuchodonosor laid waste all the intermediate countries. Afterwards Cyrus gave the people liberty. On the death of Cambyses, the nations were in consternation; and it was only during the peaceable reign of Darius that Israel returned, though not in a body, as the Jews had done twenty years before. C. 26. C.—*By one*, into the Church of Christ. Jo. 11. M.  
**13** *Trumpet.* The preaching of the Gospel for the conversion of the Jews. Ch.

## Chapter 28

**1** *Ephraim.* That is, the kingdom of the ten tribes. Ch.—*Flower.* The pride of the kingdom shall thus decay. M.—*Head.* Samaria, situated on a hill, having under it a most fertile valley. Ch.—See Amos 2:6 and 4:2. Samaria was taken in the sixth year of Ezechias.  
**2** *The Lord.* By his instrument, Salmanasar. H.—Heb. “behold the strong one, and the mighty to the Lord, as,” &c. C.—Sept. “behold the Lord’s fury … as,” &c. H.  
**4** *Up.* Theglathphalassar was captivated with the beauty of the country, and made it tributary. But Salmanasar, fearing a revolt, destroyed it. 4 K. 17:4.  
**5** **Ve** **r.** **5** **.** *People*, who returned to the service of God; or it refer to the kingdom of Juda.  
**6** *Gate.* Ezechias reunited the divided kingdoms, and inspired his troops with courage, bringing them back victorious. 2 Par. 30:1 and 4 K. 18:7. C.  
**7** *These also.* The kingdom of Juda. Ch.—Ezechias could not correct every abuse; though what is here specified, regards rather the reigns of his successors.  
**8** *Place.* All was defiled: they gloried in their shame.  
**9** *Breasts?* S. Paul seems to allude to this text. 1 Cor. 3:2. C.—The abandoned Jews ask contemptuously, if they be to be taught like children? H.  
**10** *Command*, &c. This is said in the person of the Jews, resisting the repeated commands of God, and still putting him off. Ch.—They deride the prophets, speaking words of no meaning, as if their predictions were no better. S. Jer.—Think they that we have to learn the first elements, or to join syllables together? C.—Heb. Tsau latsau, &c. H.—The Nicholaites abused these words. S. Epiph. 25.—Why do they not speak plain? Sometimes terrible things are denounced, God will lead them into a country where they shall indeed have to learn the language, like children. C. 29:11. C.—Prot. “for precept *must be* upon precept … line upon line … here a little, and there a little. For with stammering lips,” &c. H.  
**12** *Hear.* To leave off their wicked practices, and cruelty. The Jews would not understand: therefore Christ spoke to them in parables. C. 6:9. Mat. 13:14. &c.  
**13** *Taken.* God will make his prophets speak, notwithstanding your repugnance; or he will reduce you to the necessity of learning an unknown language. C.  
**14** *Men*, who make a parade of your knowledge, ( H.) to turn the most sacred things into ridicule.  
**15** *Protected.* Their conduct spoke this language. They would not fail to make alliances with Egypt, and to trust in idols, whatever the prophets might say to dissuade them. C.  
**16** *Stone.* Christ. Ch.—The Jews and Grotius would apply it to Ezechias. But he was already on the throne, and never could realize these glorious promises. The people were not to believe in him, &c. C.—*Hasten.* Let him expect his coming with patience. Ch.—It would be delayed some time. Heb. may also signify “stagger;” ( C.) in which sense the Sept. and the authors of the New Test. seem to have taken it. “Whosoever believeth in him, shall not be confounded.” See Rom. 9:33. H.—Isaias promises a Redeemer, though these people were unworthy; and then returns to his own times. M.  
**17** *Measure.* In the days of the Redeemer, they shall lead a virtuous life, ( C.) or the scorners shall be treated with rigour.—*Protection.* The wall, ( M.) or lies, (v. 15. C.) on which you depend, shall turn to your confusion. H.  
**19** *Hear.* Under the last kings of Juda, the misery was continual. Captivity opened the eyes of the people, and they were afterwards more docile. The murder of Christ, and the subsequent evils which befell the nation, seem to have had a quite different effect. They will at last submit to his yoke. C.  
**20** *Straitened.* It is too narrow to hold two: God will have the bed of our heart all to himself. Ch. 1 Cor. 10:20 and 2 Cor. 6:14. S. Jer. &c.—The Jews explain it of the utmost distress, to which the people would be reduced, so that they would not be able to assist a friend. Amos 3:12. Forcr. C.  
**21** *As in*, &c. As the Lord fought against the Philistines in Baal Pharisim, (2 K. 5) and against the Chanaanites, in the valley of Gabaon. Jos. 10. Ch.—*Strange.* He punished unwillingly. C.—“It is not God’s work to ruin what he has created.” S. Jer.—He will punish in an extraordinary manner those scoffers. v. 15. Num. 16:29. Piscat.  
**22** *Earth.* Nabuchodonosor will take a complete and speedy vengeance. C. 10:22.  
**24** *Sow.* The works of the husbandman vary, so will God’s punishments be inflicted with measure, according to each one’s deserts. v. 27. Wisd. 6:7. C.  
**25** *Gith* *.* Heb. ketsach. Sept. μελανθιον. H. Pliny xx. 17. M.—Sept. have not expressed all the terms of the original, ( H.) being perhaps ignorant of their meaning. S. Jer.  
**26** *God.* From him proceeds every useful invention. The pagans attributed the discovery of corn, &c. to their idols.  
**27** *Saws*, or heavy instruments. It would be thus crushed too much. C.  
**28** *But.* Sept. “it shall be eaten with bread. For I will not be angry with you for ever, nor shall the sounds of my bitter wrath trample upon you.” H.  
**29** *This also*, &c. Such also is the proceeding of the Lord with his land, and the diverse seeds he sows therein. Ch.

## Chapter 29

**1** *Ariel.* This word signifies *the lion of God*, and here is taken for the strong city of Jerusalem. Ch.—It was destroyed by the Chaldees, (4 K. 25) and still more by the Romans, 40 years after. C. W.—Ezechiel (43:15) styles the altar of holocausts *Ariel.*—*Took.* Sept. The Heb. means also “inhabited.” H.—Sion was called the city of David. C.—The invasion ( H.) of Sennacherib is here foretold (Forcr.) two years before. C. 31:9.  
**2** *Trench.* Sennacherib did not besiege the city. C. 37:33. But he made preparations for it, and his sentiments are expressed, ( C.) together with the fatal consequences which he felt, when his army was offered up ( H.) as a victim on the altar of holocausts. v. 1.  
**3** *Circle.* Thus provisions were cut off. C.  
**4** *The Python.* The diviner by a spirit. Ch.—Jerusalem shall hardly dare to make a noise. C.  
**5** *Away.* The numbers, and speedy downfall of the Assyrians, are described. H.  
**6** *Thunder.* Ps. 75:7. Tharaca was coming to assist Ezechias. C. 37:36. C.  
**7** *It*, in their dreams.  
**9** *Be*, &c. Though God spared the city, for the sake of the good, He will not fail to punish scoffers, in due time, as He now declares. H.—*Drunkenness* *.* You shall suffer for your crimes, (C. 28:7) or be affrighted.  
**10** *Sleep*, or compunction, (Rom. 11:8. C.) denoting their obstinacy. S. Chrys.—*Visions.* Prot. “the seers.” H.—The Jews perceived but very imperfectly the meaning of the prophets, when they spoke of a future Redeemer, God and man. They are now more infatuated, ( C.) having a veil on their hearts. 1 Cor. 4:3. Both learned and ignorant refuse to believe, excusing themselves. v. 12. H.—The more they read the Scriptures, the less do they understand. C.  
**13** *Men.* Our Saviour applies this to the Jews. The evangelists follow the Sept. Mat. 15:8. Mark 7:6. C.—“This people approacheth to me, (Grabe adds, with its mouth and with) their lips they honour me, but their heart is far from me. Yet in vain do they honour me, teaching the commands of men and doctrines.” H.—They still continue to corrupt God’s word by their false interpretations.  
**14** *Hid.* At the approach of Sennacherib, the politicians were confounded. But the obstinate blindness of the Jews in the midst of such a blaze of predictions, which are evidently accomplished in Jesus Christ, excites *admiration.* That their ancestors should have found them obscure, is not so wonderful. The prophets foretold this event; and the reprobation of the synagogue, which had been so highly favoured, is a proof of the truth of the Christian religion. 1 Cor. 1:18. C.  
**16** *Not.* So it is in vain to think that your hypocrisy or excuses will deceive God. C. 28:15. H.  
**17** *Charmel* *.* This word signifies *a fruitful field.* Ch.—Shall Carmel be presently a forest or barren mountain? No. But I will work a greater miracle. v. 18. Jerusalem shall rejoice, and Sennacherib shall be filled with dismay.  
**19** *Rejoice.* Our Saviour alludes to this text, (Lu. 7:22) which, under the figure of the deliverance from captivity, points out the vocation of the Gentiles. C. 35:5 and 42:7. 19.  
**20** *Prevail.* Wicked princes, scoffers, &c. (v. 10. C. 28:7) shall be exterminated. Ezechias promoted piety with greater zeal after his deliverance.  
**21** *Gate.* False prophets rose up against those who spoke the truth, and condemned them unjustly. C.—*The just*, Christ. M.  
**23** *I* *srael.* They shall serve God with fidelity and gratitude. C. 30:22. C.  
**24** *Murmured.* Magicians, (Grot.) or false sages. C. 28:9. C.

## Chapter 30

**1** *Of me.* Ezechias was guided by human prudence, in making an alliance with Egypt, though he might have just reasons for refusing to pay tribute to the Assyrians. 4 K. 18:20. C.—*And.* Sept. “alliances not by,” &c. H.  
**2** *Down*, with presents. v. 6. 4 K. 18:20.  
**3** *Shame.* Egypt had been defeated before Sennacherib’s approach.  
**4** *Hanes.* Chal. “Taphanes,” (Jer. 2:16) or *Daph* *næ Pelusiæ* *.* Herod. ii. 30.—In the Arabic, Nome, which formed part of ( H.) the dominions of Tharaca. C.  
**6** *Burden.* This title seems unnecessary, and may be added by some Jew, (C. 21:13) though the Chal. and others explain it, “They carry on their beasts, presents to the south,” to the nations of Arabia and Egypt, infested with lions, &c. The rest of the prophecy is against the Jews, who cannot well be styled beasts of the south. C.—Basilisk*.* The ibis devours many serpents on their flight from Arabia and Egypt. Herod. ii. 5. Solin. xxxii.  
**7** *Cried.* Heb. “called it *Rahab*, (or pride) it is rest.” The people are indolent, though they will make great promises. C.  
**8** *Box.* This word was covered with wax. Propert. iii. 3.—Write, that none may pretend that they were not admonished. Some think that this was addressed to Jeremias: but Isaias spoke to his incredulous countrymen.  
**10** *See not.* Such were the dispositions of their heart. C. 28:15.  
**11** *Us.* Mention God no more, or let him not meddle with our affairs. Seek not to reclaim us, we are pleased with our delusion. C.  
**12** *Oppression.* Lit. “calumny,” ( H.) or rebellion against the Assyrians. This was contrary to the respect due to God’s name, used in the ratification of treaties, how wicked soever those princes might be.  
**13** *For.* Ps. 61:3. If God had not miraculously cut off the army of Sennacherib, what would have become of the kingdom of Juda?  
**15** *Be.* Sept. “groan,” as Origen, &c. read. If you be seriously converted, and trust not in Egypt, you need not fear.  
**16** *Ones*, or chariots. C.—Egypt was famous for horses. Deut. 17:16. Forcr.—Rebsaces ridicules the Jews for the want of them. 4 K. 18:23. H.  
**17** *Five.* A small number shall put you to flight. M.—*Mast*, set up after a shipwreck, to warn others, or as a signal. C. 33:23.  
**18** *Wait for him.* Having convinced Ezechias that he ought to trust in on other, the Lord rescues him from the hand of Sennacherib. C.  
**19** *Weep.* The citizens expected certain death, ( H.) or slavery. C.  
**20** *Water.* The land will be reduced to a miserable condition by the ravages of Sennacherib. H.—The following was a sabbatical year. v. 23. C. 37:30.—*Teacher.* It seems that Isaias, &c. had been silent. He spoke after Ezechias had sent for him, and God promises that the people shall not be left without guides. C.—Christ will not abandon his Church. M.  
**22** *Garment.* Heb. “ephod,” belonging to the idol, or its priest. Ezechias had prohibited idolatry at first. After his deliverance he was still more zealous, and even those who had formerly retained an affection for idols, saw their vanity, and became sincere.  
**24** *Floor.* They shall not have straw only, but wheat, &c. to denote abundance.  
**25** *Towers*, or chief officers of Sennacherib. All shall be luxuriant.  
**26** *Sevenfold.* Exceedingly great, equal to the light of 49 days. C.—The fame of Ezechias spread widely. His kingdom was a figure of that of Christ, when this was more perfectly realized, the preaching of the gospel having dispelled the darkness of error. C.—He alludes to the day of judgment. S. Jer. M.  
**27** *Name.* Majesty of God, ( C.) in the future ages. H.  
**28** *Error.* The unjust government of Sennacherib, who endeavoured to engage all in idolatry.  
**29** *Night.* When the festivals commenced. C.—He may particularly mean that night, when the destroying angel slew the Egyptians. Vatab.—*Pipe.* Music. H.—This was not prescribed.  
**30** *Stones.* The Angel raised the storm, which destroyed many, while the rest in a panic fell upon one another. C. 9:5 and 28:2.  
**31** *Rod.* Sennacherib is terrified, who a few days before insulted the living God.  
**32** *Harps.* The sound of thunder will fill the people of Ezechias with joy, while the enemy shall perish irrecoverably. C.  
**33** *Topheth.* ‘Tis the same as *Gehenna*, and is taken for hell. Ch.—The Assyrians perish amid horrid cries ( H.) and thunders, which resembled the noise made by drums, and by children who were burning in the arms of Moloc. 4 K. 18:4 and 23:10. and 2 Par. 29:16. Some think that the carcasses of the Assyrians were to be burnt in this common sewer of Jerusalem. But they were too far distant. C. 37:33. C.  

---

## Chapter 31

**1** *Chariots.* He continues to inveigh against this practice. C. 30:16. C.—Salmanasar will ruin the ten tribes. M.  
**2** *Words.* The Lord will punish the wicked Jews, ( C.) after the Egyptians. Joseph. x. 1.—The former would not believe the prophets. W.  
**3** *Hand.* If God neglect to support empires, they fall of themselves.  
**4** *Thereof.* He will thence hurl destruction on the distant enemy. C.—He had destroyed Sennacherib’s army. 4 K. 19. Yet they forgot this and other proofs of God’s power and love. W.  
**5** *Over.* He will protect Jerusalem, notwithstanding the menaces of Sennacherib, as he did his people from the destroying angel.  
**6** *Revolted.* Let your conversion bear proportion ( C.) with your sins. H.  
**7** *Idols.* Their worship was afterwards more severely prohibited. C. 30:21.  
**8** *Flee not.* Heb. “flee to himself,” *lo.* Sept. and Vulg. have read la, “not.” The angel destroyed the army, and the king was slain at his return.—*Tributaries.* Ninive being afterwards subject to the Chaldees, &c. C.—Heb. “shall melt.” Vat.  
**9** *Strength.* Heb. “rock,” the king.—*Jerusalem*, to protect it, ( C.) and punish the guilty. Chal.  

---

## Chapter 32

**1** *King.* Ezechias or Josias, as figures of Jesus Christ, who is meant. C.—They and their counsellors only foreshewed the advantages derived from Christ and his apostles in a more abundant manner. S. Jer.—*Judgment and justice.* These words have a higher meaning than what is assigned to them by philosophers. In God, the former implies the preparation of the means for man’s redemption, as the latter does the execution; and in man, *judgment* denotes the selection of what is right, and *justice* implies the putting it willingly in practice. Thus Christ will fulfill all the he has graciously purposed, with the two other divine persons; and the *princes*, his pastors, shall discern what is good for their own and people’s eternal welfare. W.  
**2** *Land.* Ezechias and Josias were both a defence to their subjects.  
**3** *Dim.* True prophets shall speak, while false ones shall be silent. C.  
**4** *Plain.* Some parts of the prediction relate literally to the Old Test. But this alludes to the New, when the mysteries of religion are clearly confessed in the Catholic Church. W.—Even the most illiterate are guided with security, if they will but hear the Church. H.  
**5** *Deceitful.* Heb. “miser be called liberal.” Lu. 22:25. These good princes are contrasted with Achaz, who had oppressed his subjects.  
**7** *Vessels.* Arms, ( C.) or all the words and actions of the miser are bent on evil. H.—The ministers of wicked princes resemble them. M.  
**9** *Women.* Great cities. He announces the impending dangers.  
**10** *Year.* After a long time; or the prophet speaks two years before the arrival of Sennacherib, after the vintage was ended. C. 30:20 and 4 K. 19:29. C.  
**12** *Mourn.* Sept. “beat.” H.—*Breasts*, suckling infants. In mourning, women beat and uncovered their breasts, which, on any other occasion, would have been deemed very indecent. C. Ezec. 23:34. Herod. ii. 84.  
**13** *Up.* Being uncultivated for two years. This was still more the case during the captivity. C.—*How.* Sept. “from every house joy shall be taken away, thou rich city.” H.  
**14** *Ever.* Some palaces had been demolished by Sennacherib, though this seems to refer to the Babylonian captivity.  
**15** *Hi* *gh*, as Ezechiel (37:10) saw the dry bones rise again. Under this idea prosperity is frequently described. The rest of the chapter may very well be explained of the propagation of the gospel.—*Forest.* Carmel was a fertile spot. Judea shall flourish, and Assyria shall be laid waste. The synagogue will be rejected, while the Gentiles, ( C.) formerly so barren, shall embrace the faith and true piety.  
**17** *Peace.* The just shall enjoy peace, under Ezechias.  
**19** *Hail.* God’s judgment shall overtake Babylon, or rather Ninive.  
**20** *Waters.* Fruitful soils, abounding with cattle. C.—Both Jews and Gentiles shall submit to Christ. Clem. Strom. vi. S. Jer.  

---

## Chapter 33

**1** *Spoilest.* This is particularly directed to Sennacherib. Ch.—He was a figure of persecutors of the Church, to which many passages here allude. C.—*Remotâ justitiâ quid sunt regna nisi* *magna latrocinia?* S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. iv. 4.—Sennacherib plundered Samaria and Juda, and despising God, was himself contemned. W.  
**2** *Morning.* Speedily. Heb. “mornings,” or every day. Ezechias thus addressed God.  
**4** *Them.* The neglect of burying these insects has often brought on the plague. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. iii. 31.  
**6** *Faith.* Sincerity and justice adorn the reigns of Ezechias and Christ.  
**7** *Without.* The people of the country, and the envoys of Ezechias. 4 K. 18:14. Heb. “Behold their Ariel, cried they without,” insultingly, ( C.) pointing at Jerusalem. C. 29:1. At which ( H.) the envoys rent their garments, &c. C. 36:22. C.—“Behold I shall appear to them.” Aquila. S. Jer.—*Angels.* Messengers or deputies sent to negotiate a peace, ( Ch.) who wept because they could not obtain it. W.  
**8** *Void*, though Sennacherib had received what he demanded. 4 K. 18:14.  
**9** *Confounded.* Its trees were cut down. C. 37:24.  
**10** *Myself*, when all human aid fails.  
**11** *You*, Assyrians, are bringing destruction upon yourselves. C.  
**14** *Of you.* Heb. “of us.” H.—They are seriously alarmed at the sight of the fires prepared to burn the dead bodies of the Assyrians, (C. 30:33) and begin to think of hell, ( C.) which their sins deserve. H.  
**15** *Blood.* Avoiding revenge, and punishing the guilty, without respect to persons. Such was Ezechias, and therefore his enemies could not hurt him.  
**16** *Sure.* Never failing. C.—This was a great advantage in those dry regions. H.  
**17** *King* Ezechias, or he shall be one of his courtiers.—*Off.* Their limits shall be extended. Those who believe in Christ, shall cast their eyes up towards their heavenly country. Heb. 9:13.  
**18** *Ones.* These questions were put by the people, when the enemy approached; or they now rejoice that their severe masters were gone.  
**19** *Shameless*, unjust Assyrians. Lu. 18:2. When shame is gone, people give way to every excess.—*Profound.* Unknown to the Jews. 4 K. 18:26.—*No wisdom*, manners, or piety.  
**20** *Broken.* It was taken 125 years afterwards. The Church remains till the end of time, ( C.) whereas both the prophets and history assure us, that Jerusalem was subject to destruction. W.  
**21** *Of rivers.* He speaks of the rivers of endless joys that flow from the throne of God to water the heavenly Jerusalem, like a deep river. C.  
**23** *Thy tacklings.* He speaks of the enemies of the Church, under the allegory of a ship that is disabled. Ch.—Sennacherib shall attempt invasion no more than a ship without masts would put to sea.  
**24** *Feeble.* All were obliged to collect the plunder, to be afterwards divided. None shall plead illness. The inhabitants of Jerusalem will not feel the effects of sin ( C.) on this occasion. H.  

---

## Chapter 34

**1** *Come.* Both Gentiles and Jews are admonished of the world’s end before judgment. W.  
**4** *Away.* These strong expressions denote great misery. C. 13. Joel 2:10. Ezec. 32:27. C.—*Book.* Heb. “roll.” H.—Some thence foolishly inferred that the destiny of every one might be read in the heavens. Huet. Eus. præp. vi. 11. Philoo. xxiii. Pic. Astrol. viii. 5.—The prophet only means that the heavens shall be devoid of beauty, ( C.) and covered with darkness. H.  
**5** *Heaven.* Casting down the rebel angels. S. Jer.—The resolution to destroy the Idumeans, for their cruelty to the Jews, has been taken long ago. All these expressions allude to the last judgment. C.—Idumea*.* Under the name of Idumea or Edom, a people that were enemies of God and his Church. Ch.—Assaradon fell upon Edom two years after Sennacherib’s death. C.—No strong place like Bosra, shall rescue any from destruction at the last day. W.  
**7** *The unicorns.* That is, the great and mighty. Ch.  
**8** *Recompenses.* When the persecutors of Sion, that is, of the Church, shall receive their reward. Ch.—The Idumeans had frequently shown their ill-will towards the Jews. 2 Par. 28:17. Amos 1:11. C.—Sion shall perish as the wicked in hell shall be tormented. W.  
**9** *Pitch.* The soil was sulphureous, and became neglected, (v. 10) like the territory of Sodom. The people are now no more, and only a few miserable Arabs pitch their tents there.  
**11** *Line.* Intimating entire destruction. Lam. 2:8 and 4 K. 11:13. C.—Yet God will not punish more than people deserve. M.  
**13** *Dragons, Thannim.* C. 13:22. H.—*Ostrich* *es*, or swans.  
**14** *Monsters.* Lit. “Ass-centaurs.” H.—Heb. “fishermen shall find islands.” C. 13:21.—*Ones.* Goats.—*Lamia* *.* Heb. lilith*.* Chal. “owl,” the bird of Minerva, or the Moon, which the Arabs style Alilat. C.—Dicodorus (20) relates that Lamia was an African queen, who having last her children, was changed into a beast, and destroyed all the children she could catch; and the Jews deal still more in fables, ( C.) asserting that Lilith was the first wife of Adam, &c. Buxtorf. Syn. 2.  
**15** *Ericius* *.* Heb. “kippoz, ( H.) hath its nest.” It may denote the serpent, acontias. Bochart.—All this shews the desolation of the country.  
**16** *Read* what I have written.—*The other.* All these beasts will be there, ( C.) or all these declarations will be verified. H.  

---

## Chapter 35

**1** *Lily.* Judea flourishes under Ezechias: but the Church does more so after the coming of Christ, to whom these expressions conduct us. C.—The Gentiles shall be converted and flourish, as this text shews. W.  
**2** *Joy.* The primitive Christians rejoiced in a good conscience, and in suffering for the truth.  
**3** *Knees.* Ye prophets, comfort the people with these promises. C.—The apostles taught the Gentiles to do good. M.  
**4** *Recompense.* Christ will satisfy the justice of his Father. H.—He will redeem the world, and refute the false interpretations of the Bible. C.—He will bring the devil into subjection. M.  
**6** *Free.* Our Saviour healed both soul and body, ( C.) shewing by his works (Jo. 10. W.) that he had fulfilled this prediction. Lu. 7:22. Mat. 11:5.—*Waters.* Baptism has sanctified the most wicked.  
**7** *Dragons.* Sea monsters. C. 34:13. C.—All shall be in proper order, neither too dry nor too wet. H.  
**8** *Way*, leading to Jerusalem. Idolaters, &c. shall not be there. C. 52:1. This was only verified ( C.) in the Catholic Church, where, though some wicked may be found, the truth still prevails; and holiness can be obtained no where else. H.—This Church is unspotted. Eph. 5:27. C.—*Fools.* The most simple may learn what is necessary for salvation, ( M.) which will never be done by consulting Scripture alone. H.  
**9** *Lion.* The devil’s power shall be repressed, so that none will be deluded except by their own fault. M.  
**10** *Sion.* Before the defeat of Sennacherib, the roads were unsafe. C. 38:8. C.

## Chapter 36

**1** *And.* These four chapters are taken from 4 K. 18. &c. as a sort of explanation of what Isaias has been foretelling. C.—An abridgment also occurs, 2 Par. 32.  
**7** *Altar.* Such is the blindness of infidels, that they confound what is done to destroy idols, with their worship. W.

## Chapter 37

**1** *Sackcloth.* Emblems of repentance. Sennacherib’s boasting (v. 13) was chastised. v. 36. W.  
**7** *Spirit.* Angel, or a different design. 2 Thes. 2:8. C.  
**18** *Lands.* Heb. “all the lands and their land.” The parallel text is more correct, “the nations and their land.” Kennicott.  
**24** *Carmel.* See 4 K. 19. Ch.  
**25** *Shut*, &c. Heb. matsor, ( H.) “of Egypt,” where Sennacherib had been. C.  
**29** *Lips*, and treat thee like some ungovernable beast. H. Ezec. 29:4 and 38:4. C.  
**30** *Thee.* He directeth his speech to Ezechias.  
**35** *Servant.* Hence it plainly appears that God protects the living for the sake of the saints departed. To evade this proof, Prot. (Bible 1603) explain, “for God’s promise sake made to David.” But God never made any such promise to him; otherwise the city would never have been destroyed. W.  
**36** *They.* The people of Jerusalem, or rather the soldiers of Ezechias, who saw those who had been slain, near Pelusium. C.

## Chapter 38

**9** *Ezechias.* Sanchez groundlessly thinks it was composed by Isaias. C.—Ezechias was afflicted lest he should give way to dangerous joy. W.  
**10** *Hell.* Sheol, or Hades, the region of the dead. Ch.—He was afraid to die without issue. S. Jer. 5:12.—Manasses was born three years later. C.—The king would naturally have died. S. Aug. de Gen. ad lit. vi. 17. W.  
**11** *Living.* I shall not assist at the festivals of the Lord in the temple.  
**14** *For me.* He represents his disease, as an inexorable creditor.  
**18** *Truth.* He speaks only of the body.  
**22** *Lord.* The answer is given, (4 K. 20:9) which seems to evince that this is only an extract. C.—The prophet prescribed the medicine, and the king asked for a sign before he sung the canticle. W.  

---

## Chapter 39

**1** *And.* Sept. add, “ambassadors and presents.” See 4 K. 20:12. C.  
**8** *Days.* He is not unconcerned about his children, but dares not request more. Having given way to immoderate joy and vanity, he was informed that all his treasures should be taken away. W.  

---

## Chapter 40

**1** *Be.* Sept. “comfort my people.” Let them not be dejected. H.—The end of the captivity, and still more the coming of the Messias, afford consolation, ( C.) and to this the prophet chiefly alludes. W.  
**2** *Evil.* Heb. and some Latin copies have, “warfare.”—*Double.* A rigorous chastisement. Apoc. 18:6. C.  
**3** *God*, that he may conduct his people from Babylon. Sanchez.—Yet the prophet speaks chiefly of the baptist, (Mat. 3:3. C.) who is evidently foretold. W.  
**4** *Plain.* For the captives, or the conversion of the world. Bar. 5:6.  
**5** *Glory.* God will rescue his people. Christ will redeem mankind.  
**6** *Field.* On the downfall of the empire of Babylon, the Jews were liberated.  
**9** *Thou*, female. How beautiful are the feet of those who announce good tidings! Rom. 10:15. H.—Thus a feminine noun is applied to Solomon. Eccle. i. Prophets make known to all the coming of the Saviour. C.—Christ preaches from the mountain, and his apostles over the world. W.  
**10** *H* *im.* Christ will reward and punish. Jer. 31:16. Lu. 2:34.  
**11** *Young*, or have lately had young lambs, *fœtas* *.* Jesus is the good shepherd. Jo. 10:14.  
**12** *Who.* He now proceeds to shew the difference between God and idols.—*Fingers*, is not expressed in Heb. which may denote the epha. Ps. 79:6. C.—God’s power and goodness in the works of the creation, shew what he will do for man. W.  
**15** *Du* *st.* Heb. caddak, ( H.) “as dok fallen.” Sym.—It may signify an atom. S. Jer.—If all nations be only like a *drop*, what portion of it do I occupy? C. v. 17.  
**18** *Image.* Catholics never pretend to represent the Deity, when they depict the Father as a venerable old man, &c. The do not adore pictures, as our adversaries would insinuate. If we were disposed to cavil, we might bring the same charge against them. For a few weeks ago, “a beautiful altar-piece, painted and presented by the lady of major general Cheney, was put in Horn-sea church, representing Christ blessing the bread and wine.” But Protestants can confine such things to their proper use, and Catholic must adore them. H.—“Such things the Jew, Apella, may believe: not I.” Horace.  
**19** *Silver.* Is God like these idols? H.—Who knows not that the workman is better than they are? Wis. 13:11. C.  
**20** *Wood.* Heb. hamsuccan, ( H.) which Sept. Chal. and S. Jerom explain of a sort of wood used for idols. Moderns take it to be “a rich,” or rather “a poor man. He who is mean in his offering, chooses wood that,” &c. C. Prot.  
**21** *Beginning*, by the light of nature, and ( W.) has not Moses declared that God alone created the world? H.—His power and goodness herein convince us that he will not deny grace. W.  
**22** *Locusts*, compared with the greatest animals.—*Nothing.* Heb. “a curtain.” Sept. Syr. “vault, ( C.) or chamber,” καμαραν.  
**23** *Searchers.* Heb. “princes to nothing.” Prot. H.—Philosophers know nothing independently of God, nor can they subsist without him. W.  
**26** *Host* of heaven, the stars, &c. Gen. 2:1. Ps. 146:4.  
**27** *Judgment*, or conduct, (Gen. 40:13. C.) as if God minded not our affairs.  
**31** *Eagles*, who grow young, when they get new feathers. Ps. 102:5. S. Jer.—In this and the following 26 chapters the prophet chiefly comforts his people, as he had rebuked them for their crimes in the first part. W.  

---

## Chapter 41

**1** *Islands*, near Asia, whose conversion Isaias often predicts, ( C.) as he does that of all nations. H.—God continues to prove his divinity, ( C.) expostulating with idolaters, whose conversion is insinuated, and among the rest that of Britain, which is the most renowned island in Europe. Bristow, anot. 11. W.  
**2** *Just one.* Sept. “justice.” Christ, (Eus. S. Jer.) Abraham, (Chal. Grot.) or Cyrus, whose conquests were effects of God’s providence. v. 10. C. 45.—*Kings.* Cyrus liberated Persia, conquered Babylon and all Asia.  
**3** *Feet.* His march and victories shall be so rapid, like those of Alexander. Dan. 8:5.  
**4** *Beginning.* Disposing all things, as the conquests of Cyrus, announced so long before by name, evince.—*Last.* Alpha and Omega. Apoc. 1:8 and 22:13.  
**5** *Isl* *ands.* People of Asia Minor. Gen. 10:5. C.—The Babylonians made a league with the most potent king Crœsus, to oppose the young conqueror. Xen. B. i.  
**7** *Moved.* Thus the nations conspire against Cyrus ( C.) and the Messias. H.  
**10** *Upheld thee.* Cyrus shall gain the victory, and give thee liberty.  
**14** *Dead.* Though you were in the grave, I could protect you. Captivity is often represented under this idea. C.—You who are despised, fear not, since Christ will protect and reward you. W.  
**15** *Chaff.* Cambyses perished on the mountains of Judea, ( H.) and the Machabees gained many victories over the Syrians. Mic. 4:13. Ezec. 39. C.—They are here meant, as their exploits resembled those of Cyrus. Houbigant.  
**18** *Waters.* The captives shall be refreshed in the deserts. C. 35:6 and 43:20. C.  
**19** *The thorn.* In Hebrew, the shitta or *settim*, a tree resembling the whitethorn. Ch. S. Jer.—A fragrant shade shall speedily rise up. Bar. 5:6. C.  
**21** *Thing.* Add “strong,” *forte*, ( H.) any good proof of idolatry.  
**23** *Good.* The prescience and power of God prove his divinity. Can idols produce any thing similar? C.—None can tell what will happen, unless God reveal it. W.  
**24** *Work.* All that you can do or promise. Heb. “your work is worse than a viper.”  
**25** *Sun.* Cyrus had a Persian for his father, and a Mede for his mother; thus uniting both nations, ( C.) so that he was styled a *mule* by an ancient oracle. Eus. præp. ix. 41.—These countries lay to the north-east of Judea. C.  
**26** *Just*, or “the just one,” ( H.) that we may recognise Cyrus at once.—*Your words.* He addresses the idols. You cannot dive into futurity. C.  
**28** *I.* Isaias, ( M.) or God, ( H.) pronounces sentence against the speechless idols. M.  

---

## Chapter 42

**1** *My servant.* Christ, who, according to his humanity, is the servant of God, ( Ch.) and Redeemer of others; none else being able to satisfy for themselves. W. Phil. 2:7. C.—This passage clearly refers to the Messias, (Chal. Kimchi) who was prefigured by Cyrus. v. 6. C. Hugo.—It is quoted by S. Mat. (12:18) who has some variations both from the Heb. and the Sept. ( C.) particularly the first part of v. 4 which the Sept. renders, “He shall shine, and shall not be broken.”  
**4** *Islands.* Sept. and S. Mat. “the Gentiles shall hope in his name.” H.  
**6** *Gentiles.* This was literally verified in Christ. Cyrus is also styled the just, (C. 41:26) and gave liberty to many nations.  
**7** *House.* The Jews out of captivity, prefigured the redemption of mankind. These miracles proved that Jesus was the Messias. Lu. 7:22.  
**8** *Things.* They shall not partake of my divinity. Our Saviour was truly God. Phil. 2:6.  
**9** *Them.* The completion of former predictions enforces the belief of those which are yet to come. C.  
**10** *All.* Lit. “its fullness,” ( H.) sailors, ( C.) and fishes. H.—He concludes with a canticle.  
**11** *Cedar*, or the Jews in exile in the desert Arabia. P. 119:5. C.—The people dwell in tents. Roger. ii. 5.—Petra. A city that gives name to Arabia Petræa. Ch.  
**13** *Enemies.* The Chaldees, ( C.) by the hand of Cyrus.  
**15** *Pools.* Cyrus deluged the country about Babylon. C. 13 and 21:1. H.—The proud and covetous, who expected Christ to give them kingdoms, were deceived. He came to teach humility, and to grant eternal rewards. W.  
**16** *Blind* captives, or converts to Christianity.  
**18** *Deaf* Jews, who would not listen to the prophets. v. 19. C.  
**19** *Sold.* Heb. Cimshullam, ( H.) the perfect, or favoured. The Turks call “believers” *Musselman* *s.* C.  
**22** *Men*, whom they corrupt by their bad example. H.—Heb. “their young men are in chains,” during the last wars, and the captivity of Juda. C.  
**24** *We.* Sept. “they have sinned,” which seems preferable. H.  

---

## Chapter 43

**1** *And.* Notwithstanding the sins of his people, God will deliver them, that they may be his witnesses. v. 10. C.—*Name.* As an intimate friend, ( H.) or slave. C. 49:1. C.—God grants grace without any preceding merit. W.—Forerius explains this mostly of the Gentile church, though it regards the converted Jews. Houbig.  
**2** *Waters.* In every emergency, God will protect thee, ( C.) as he did the three children. H.—He will suffer none to perish, without their own fault. Hence the Church still continues pure. W.  
**3** *Ethiopia.* Heb. “Chus,” the isle of Meroe, (Grot.) or the country bordering on the Red Sea. C. 45:14. These were given to indemnify Cyrus. They obtained their liberty to return home, after 40 years. Ezec. 29:11.  
**4** *Eyes*, by a gratuitous choice.—*Men.* Chaldees, &c.  
**5** *East.* Babylon.—*West.* The island beyond the Mediterranean.  
**6** *North.* Assyria.—*South.* Egypt. The captives returned from these countries under Cyrus, Alex. &c. so that before the coming of Christ, Judea was as well peopled as ever. C.  
**7** *Calleth.* Heb. “is called by my name.” Prot. H.—My people’s chastisements and liberation prove my divine perfections.  
**8** *Ears.* Yet will not hear, ( C.) or who are miraculously healed. H.—It seems rather to mean idolatrous *nations*, (v. 9. C.) or rebellious Jews. Forer. Houbigant.  
**9** *Former.* The pagans were little acquainted with antiquity. Such researches lead to the knowledge of the true religion. H.—*Truth*, if they can produce any true prophecy.  
**10** *Witnesses.* The history of the Israelites was sufficient to shew who was God. C.—Thus the establishment of Christianity manifests its truth. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. xxii. 6.—Sept. add, “and I am witness.” H.  
**12** *One* idol, to announce what would happen.  
**14** *Bars.* Sept. “fugitives.” Theodot. “strong ones.”—*Glorying.* Sept. “shall be bound in ships,” to be sent beyond the Caspian Sea. C.—Cyrus was victorious for the sake of God’s people; for he will not neglect his Church. W.  
**16** *Waters.* of the Jordan and the Red Sea, in the latter of which Pharao perished. v. 17.  
**19** *New.* I shall work the like miracles as were seen in the wilderness.  
**20** *Chosen.* We know not that rivers were found in Arabia. But the people were equally favoured. Christ facilitates the road to heaven by his example and graces, while the most savage tempers are changed in baptism.  
**23** **Ve** **r.** **23** **.** *Incense.* My kindness is gratuitous. In a strange land, thou couldst not offer sacrifice. See C. 48:9 and 49:1. C.  
**24** *Iniquities.* Thou hast shewn the greatest ingratitude. H.—Yet I will save thee.  
**26** *Thyself.* God condescends to act thus with men. C. 41:20. Osee 4:1.  
**27** *First father.* Adam, (Liran.) or rather Abraham *sinned*, by diffidence, (Gen. 15:8. S. Jer.) or was formerly an idolater. Jos. 24:2. Geneb. A. 2049 S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. 12. C. T.—*Teachers.* Lit. “interpreters,” ( H.) Moses and Aaron. Num. 20:9. C.—All the patriarchs and teachers sinned, till Christ, the immaculate lamb, appeared. Adam engaged all in guilt. W.  
**28** *Profaned*, or declared such, ( H.) Nadab, &c. (Lev. 10:1. C.) or Moses and Aaron. M.—Sept. “and the princes defiled my holy *things.*” H.—*Slaug* *hter.* Heb. “anathema.” Yet I will re-establish all. C.

## Chapter 44

**3** *Stock.* I will give fresh life to my people, as to the figure of Christ’s Church.  
**5** *Israel.* They shall no longer be ashamed of being called Israelites or Christians.  
**8** *Wit* *nesses.* The history of the true religion is its best proof. C. 43:9. 10.—*Known.* Ruled, consequently no other can be truly God. C.—Idolaters are foolish, trusting in those who cannot announce future events. W.  
**9** *Ashamed* of the origin and imbecility of their idols. C.—All this may be turned against heretics, who worship their own fictions; which the Church never does. S. Jer. W.  
**12** *File.* Heb. mahatsad, ( H. Jer. 10:3.) “to make an ax, with,” &c. This is the remote cause of the idol.  
**13** *Man.* To be styled afterwards a god. C.—*Maluit esse deum* *.* Hor. i. ser. 8.  
**18** *Covered.* Sept. “darkened.” Are Catholics in the same predicament? C. 40:18. H.  
**20** *Lie.* Can I assert in conscience that it is a god?  
**22** *Return* from captivity, ( C.) and from their former errors. Mat. 11:26. H.  
**25** *Mad.* That people may be no longer deluded.  
**26** *Servant.* The prophets and Jesus Christ, whose works never fail. Mat. 24:35. C.—In all this prediction of the Church, Isaias alludes to Jerusalem destroyed, and afterwards rebuilt. W.  
**27** *Deep.* Babylon, situated amid waters. C. 21:1. C.—*Rivers*, as Cyrus did. Herod. i. 191.  
**28** *Cyrus.* This was spoken 110 years before his birth, which shews the prescience and power of God, so as not to injure free-will. The parents of Cyrus could not give him this name to fulfill the prediction, as they knew nothing of it. Amon was apprised that a person called Josias would overturn idolatry; but he had no reason to suppose that it would be his son. 1 K. 13:2.—*My shepherd.* Chal. “that he shall reign.” This was shewn by the Jews to Cyrus, on which account, ( C.) he gave them leave to return, &c. Joseph. xi. 1.—The title of shepherd is given to Agamemnon by Homer, and it denotes a good prince, such as historians represent Cyrus to have been. He observed that kings and shepherds had the like duties to perform; (Xenoph. viii.) and after his death he was bewailed as a “father.” Herod. iii. 89.—At first he did not bear the name of Cyrus, (Herod. i. 113.) which in the Persian language means “the sun.” Ctesias. Plut.

## Chapter 45

**1** *Anointed*, often implies one chosen for some great work. Cyrus was to ruin the empire of Babylon, and to set the nations at liberty. He was a proof of the Deity by executing his decrees.—*Cyrus.* Some copies of the Sept. seem to have read κυριω, “to the Lord,” incorrectly. S. Jer.—Though Cyrus was not anointed, he is styled thus, in allusion to the custom of the Jewish kings. W.  
**2** **Ver** **.** **2** **.** *Brass.* Babylon had 100 such gates. Herod. i. 179.  
**3** *Treasures.* See Pliny xxxiii. 3. He overcame the rich king of Lydia, &c.  
**4** *Likeness* of Christ.—*Known me.* Before the Jews had shewn Cyrus the prophecies, he did not attribute his success to the Lord, and even afterwards he seems not to have left the superstitions of his country, as his sacrifices to idols are described. He resembled Nabuchodonosor and the philosophers, who did not glorify God according to their knowledge. Dan. 2:47. Rom. 1:21. Cyrus even revoked the decree for building the temple. 1 Esd. 4:5. C.—He believed there was one God; (1 Esd. 1) yet he did not embrace the truth entirely. W.  
**7** *Create evil*, &c. The evils of afflictions and punishments, but not the evil of sin. Ch.—I afflict and comfort my people.  
**8** *Saviour.* Thus the ancient saints thirsted for the coming of Christ. His figure is styled the just. C. 41:2. 25.—*Him.* Christ, born of the virgin, in time, and of God from all eternity. I have appointed Cyrus to be his precursor, to set the captives free. C.—He has been spoken of before. But now the prophet turns to Christ alone, who built his Church on a rock. W.—Cyrus had not a right faith in God, and Zorobabel was himself set free, and was not king. S. Jer.  
**9** *Earthen.* Lit. “Samian.” H.—Samos was famous for its pottery. Pliny xxxv. 12. Heb. “Clay, *disputest thou* against the potters of the earth?” He shews the folly of idols, after having proved his own divinity. C.—Prot. “Let the potsherds *strive* with the potsherds of the earth.” H.  
**10** *Forth.* As such language would be improper to parents, so it is wrong to complain that God places us in any situation. M.  
**11** *To me.* Ask what will come to pass, or direct me how to act.  
**13** *Justice.* Cyrus shall punish the Chaldees and restore the Jews. C.—The prophet returns to him after having mentioned a greater Saviour. v. 8. Houbig.  
**14** *Stature:* the people of Saba were the tallest and best proportioned in Arabia. Agathar. v. 50.—Cyrus possessed all these countries. He sent the Egyptians home in the third year of his reign, at Babylon, A. 3470. Ezec. 29:11. They never became subject to the Jews; but embraced the religion of Christ, acknowledging him for God. v. 15. C.—*Besides thee.* Prot. “Surely God *is* in thee, and *there is* none else, *there is* no God.” Those whom we have hitherto adored, deserved not the name. Vulg. and Sept. make the people address Christ, the God-man. H.  
**15** *Saviour.* We confess that thou hast delivered the Jews; or rather, we acknowledge that thou, O Christ, art true God under the veils of thy human nature, and Saviour of all. Cyrus was only a feeble representation of thee.  
**16** *Confusion.* Idolaters shall be confounded, when they shall behold the glory of the elect.  
**18** **Ve** **r.** **18** **.** *In vain.* Heb. “to be a chaos.” Gen. 8:2.  
**19** *Earth.* The pagan oracles were given chiefly in mountains, where the impostures of the priests might escape detection. They were also generally ambiguous, or mere guesses. The declarations of the true prophets were quite the reverse.—*In vain;* without reward. C.  
**20** *Gentiles:* converts, ( H.) or Jews, returning from Babylon.  
**21** *Me.* He transports his auditors to the times succeeding the captivity, when the completion of the prophecies will be evident.  
**23** **Ver.** **23–24** **.** *Myself*, having none greater. Heb. 6:13.—*Justice:* sure.—*To me.* All that are born belong to me. The Jewish women had seldom recourse to midwives, (Ex. 1:19 and 1 K. 4:19. C.) no more than the Ethiopians. Ludolf. i. 14.—*Swear*, by the true God. H.—Oaths on proper occasions, honour him. Deut. 6:13. Nothing could be spoken more plainly of the Gentiles’ conversion.  
**25** *Empire.* Cyrus shall make this confession, (1 Esd. 1:2) and all who embrace the religion of Christ, shall attribute all their virtue to him.

## Chapter 46

**1** *Bel;* perhaps Nimrod, ( C.) or Saturn, to whom they sacrificed their children. W.—*Nabo*, “the oracle” of Belus. The Chaldees adored statues and beasts. But the Persians worshipped the elements. C.—Xerxes destroyed the tomb of Belus, after his expedition into Greece. Arrian vii.) He had there demolished the temples, (Herod. viii. 109.) pretending ( H.) that “the world is the house of the gods.” Cic. Leg. ii.—*Weariness.* The priests affected to be weighed down, as if the god were present. Bar. 6:25. S. Cyr.  
**2** *They.* Lit. “their soul.” H.—The pagans must have supposed they had one. C.—*Captivity.* “There are as many triumphs over the gods as over men.” Tert.—The former shared the fate of their adorers. Their statues were plundered.  
**3** *By my.* Vulg. may have read *a me ab*, ( C.) instead of *a meo.* Heb. and Sept. “taken from the womb,” ( H.) and treated with the utmost tenderness. C.  
**8** *Ashamed.* Sept. “groan.” Prot. “shew yourselves men.” H.  
**11** *Bird;* Cyrus, whose rapid conquests are thus denoted. C.—He chose a golden eagle, with wings expanded, for his standard. Xen. vii.—Christ came from heaven to redeem the world. Ps. 18:6. Mal. 4:2. C.—He was the orient, adored by the eastern sages, to whom the prophet refers. S. Jer. W.  
**12** *Israel.* It shall no longer be a reproach. Cyrus shall restore my people to their own country. But Christ more full accomplished what is here declared respecting the establishment of his Church. C.

## Chapter 47

**1** *Virgin;* delicate. M.—Cyrus overthrew this empire, ( C.) which now felt its share of misery. W.  
**2** *Shame.* Heb. tsammathec, Cant. 4:1, 4. Prot. “thy locks, make bare the legs, uncover the thigh, pass,” &c. H.—Thou shalt be reduced to a state of the most abject slavery. Ex. 11:5. Sup. 3:17 and 20:4. The Barbarians sold their slaves naked.  
**6** *Polluted;* deemed or declared unclean. But thou hast sought to gratify thy vindictive temper, in punishing my people. C.—The sins of both called down vengeance. W.  
**7** *Lady.* Pride goes before ruin. Prov. 16:18.  
**9** *Two.* The empire and the people shall be removed at once.—*Enchanters;* princes or magicians, who gave them evil counsel. v. 12.  
**11** *Know.* All this shews the vanity of magic, which cannot announce future events to do any good. C.  
**13** *Months*, to tell which would prove lucky. Est. 3:7.  
**14** *Thereat*, to warm themselves, ( H.) or to adore. C.—In Cappadocia are to be seen “Pyratheia, … in which the magi keep a perpetual fire, and sing hymns about the space of an hour.” Strabo xv.—These were a sort of open temples. C.  
**15** *Merchants.* The city was well situated for trade. C. 13:20. Diod. ii.  

---

## Chapter 48

**1** *Waters;* people, (Apoc. 17:15. H.) or from the stock of Juda. Prov. 5:15. C.—He claimed the sovereign power, but had not the fortitude or wisdom for *Israel.* W.  
**2** *City:* citizens of Jerusalem. Dan. 3:28. Mat. 4:5.  
**3** *Suddenly*, when there was no human appearance of the event, as when I foretold the exploits of Cyrus and the ruin of Babylon so long before.  
**4** *Brass;* unblushing. Jer. 3:3. C.—*Os tuum ferreum* *.* Cic. c. Piso.  
**6** *Them.* Could you have believed them?—*Knowest not.* He upbraids their ignorance and indocility.  
**7** *Knew.* Therefore I did not speak of the liberation from Egypt, but from Babylon, which is represented as just taking place. C.  
**8** *Opened;* docile, (Theod.) or acquainted with these things. Isaias first made known the captivity of Babylon, and its end; and he insists so much, that people may discern the truth of his predictions, and of religion. No atheist can, with a good conscience, hold out against his arguments. C. 40. &c.  
**9** *Bridle thee*, like a headstrong beast, ( C.) running to its own ruin. H.—God pardons freely, that people may be saved if they will. W.  
**10** *Poverty*, at Babylon. I have not treated thee with the utmost rigour, nor attempted to render thee free from every imperfection. C.—Sept. “Lo, I have sold thee, but not for silver; I have snatched thee from the,” &c. H.  
**14** *Things*, as I have done respecting Cyrus? (S. Cyr. &c.) who was a figure of Christ. v. 15.  
**16** *Spirit.* The Fathers here find the three Persons of the blessed Trinity specified. Isaias was not from the *beginning*, though the text may also speak of him C. as the spoke long before the event, by divine inspiration. Chal. S. Jer.  
**19** *Name.* The Jews were not forgotten, till they had rejected the Messias.  
**21** *Out.* Their return was facilitated. This may easily be applied ( C.) to the conversion of the Gentiles. S. Jer.  
**22** *Peace.* Sept. “rejoicing,” or prosperity for the Chaldees or wicked Jews. v. 18. C.—It is promised only to the penitent. W.

**1** *Give.* This fresh discourse continues to C. 56:9 relating to the Messias, who is introduced speaking to all the world. Acts 13:47 and 2 Cor. 6:2. Some apply a part to Cyrus, Isaias, or the Baptist, as to his figures. C.—The prophet has foretold the conversion of the Gentiles, as he now does, like an evangelist. S. Jer.—Many Jews will embrace the gospel at the end of time. W.  
**2** *Sword*, penetrating the very soul, (Heb. 4:12) and slaying the wicked. Apoc. 1:16 and 2 Thess. 2:8. Without Christ, his ministers can apply this sword to little purpose. Cyrus cut asunder the bonds of the captives by his decree. C.—Grotius improperly explains all of Isaias. Houbigant.  
**3** *Glory.* In the Church, God is adored in spirit and truth. Isaias is ordered thus to address the Israelites.  
**4** *God.* He will reward the labours of his ministers, though the people be obstinate. The prophets and our Saviour frequently complain. C. 65:2. Mar. 9:18.  
**5** *Will not.* Heb. Sept. &c. “to be gathered.” H.—The original text, independent of the Masorets, may have the sense of the Vulg. Yet there are other proofs of the synagogue’s rejection. C.—Prot. “though Israel be not gathered, yet,” &c. Margin, or “that Israel may be gathered, and I may,” &c. H.  
**6** *Earth.* S. Paul, explains this of Christ, (Acts 13) who said, *Go teach all nations.* Mat. 28. Isaias was one of his first preachers.  
**7** *Despised*, Christ, Cyrus, or Isaias; though it refer chiefly to our Saviour.  
**9** *Ways.* The captives shall find every convenience. C.  
**12** *South.* Heb. Sinim; ( H.) China, (S. Jer.) or rather Sin, or Pelusium, and Sinai, in Egypt and Arabia. Sept. “Persians.” C.  
**14** *Sion*, the Jews, who will at last be converted in great numbers. Houbigant.  
**16** *Hands*, which were nailed to the cross. Sept. “I have delineated thy walls on my hands, and thou art before me always.” H.—The Assyrians wore such characters on their hands or necks. Lucian. Lev. 19:28. C.—Christ will always love his Church, which is of all times and nations. W.  
**17** *Of thee.* Sanballat, &c. shall yield to Zorobabel, Nehemias, &c.  
**19** *Inhabitants.* The country was better peopled, ( C.) and Jerusalem enlarged under the Machabees. Jos. Bel. v. 6.  
**20** *Barrenness*, of which thou complainest. He alludes to the captives who returned, and to Christian converts. M.  
**22** *Shoulders.* Thus the Syrians commonly carried children astride. Cotovic. xiv.  
**23** *Nurses.* The Persian kings favoured the captives. The greatest monarchs bow before the prelates of the Church, ( M.) and kiss the Pope’s toe. They venerate relics, ( H.) and greatly enrich the Church. C.  
**24** *Strong.* Can I force the Babylonians to yield? Surely, and the devil also. Lu. 11:21.—*Mighty.* Heb. “just,” in lawful war. Sept. “unjustly.”  
**26** *Flesh.* They shall attack one another. C.—Neriglissor slew Evil-merodac. Beros. c. Ap. i.—Gobrias and Gadatas betrayed and killed Baltassar. Xenoph. iv. 5. and 7. C.—In their fury they shall tear their own flesh. M.

## Chapter 50

**1** *Away.* Such a one could not be received again, if she had taken another husband. Deut. 24:3. Some explain this of the captives. But God restored them to favour. It seems rather to relate to the reprobation ( C.) of the synagogue, which will never again become the true Church, ( H.) though many of Israel will be converted. Rom. 11:25.—*Sold you*, as a father might do. Ex. 21:1. Mat. 18:15. S. Ambrose (Tob. viii.) inveighs against such cruel parents, as the Christian religion had not then entirely repressed this inhumanity. C.—God rejected the synagogue, not out of hard-heartedness or want, but because of her sins. W.  
**2** *Hear.* My spouse had gone after other lovers. The people refused to hear the prophets; and the priests were become as corrupt as the rest, when the city was taken by the Chaldees and by the Romans. C.—*Sea.* Babylon. C. 21. H.—I could work the same miracles, as I did when Israel came out of Egypt.  
**4** *Weary.* Isaias speaks in the name of Christ, whose words carried conviction and comfort along with them. Jo. 6:69 and 7:46. C.—*Wakeneth.* Lit. “lifteth up.” *Cynthius âurem*—*Vellit* *.* Ec. 6.—*Hear*, or obey. H.—Christ preached more powerfully than Isaias, and continues to do so by his pastors. S. Jer. W.  
**6** *Spit.* The greatest indignity. Job 30:10. Deut. 25:9. Yet this was the treatment of our Saviour. Lu. 18:31. Mat. 26:67. C.—“The great Grotius, (I wish he were great in explaining the prophets)” applies this to Jeremias. Houbigant.  
**7** *Rock.* Christ heard the accusations of his enemies unmoved, as the had not been afraid to blame the conduct of the Pharisees.  
**10** *Light.* The faithful are exhorted to take courage, while the Romans will destroy the rebellious Jews, (v. 11. C.) and the wicked shall dwell in hell *fire.* M.

## Chapter 51

**1** *Lord.* He speaks of the redemption of mankind, under the allegory of the return from captivity.  
**2** *Alone*, and gave him children when he was grown old, and Sara barren. I can surely save you likewise. C.—The example of these great progenitors is set before the Jews. Thus S. Paul says: *Remember your prelates.* Heb. 13. W.  
**4** *Nations.* This was verified when the Bible was translated into Greek, and still more by the preaching of the gospel.  
**5** *Just.* Christ, prefigured by Cyrus, whose empire was very mild. C. 44:28.  
**6** *Fail.* Mat. 24:35. The prosperity of the Jews was not of long duration. But the Church will remain till the end of time.  
**9** *Proud.* Heb. “Rahab,” Pharao, king of Egypt. Job 26:12. Ezec. 29:3. C.—God drowned in the water, which had retired for Israel. He will thus destroy the devil. W.  
**13** *Oppressor.* If thou hadst not abandoned God, thou wouldst have had no reason to fear Nabuchodonosor; and his power is now gone.  
**14** *Fail.* Cyrus shall quickly restore the Jews to their country. He shall not lay waste the provinces, like many conquerors.  
**16** *People.* This may refer to Isaias, Cyrus, &c. as figures of Christ. C. 49:1. He has bestowed greater favours on Christians than Cyrus did on the Jews, opening the kingdom of *heaven* to true believers, &c. Eph. 2:19.  
**17** *Dregs.* Take courage: Babylon’s turn is come. v. 23. C.  
**19** **Ve** **r.** **19** **.** *Two.* War and famine cause desolation and destruction. W.—Jerusalem was reduced to the greatest misery in the last siege under Nabuchodonosor. Lam. 4:3. C.  
**20** *Ox, oryx.* Heb. Thua. Deut. 14:5. H.—Many accounts respecting it are fabulous. Some understand a sort of wolf, mentioned by Pliny viii. 34. Sept. “like beet half boiled.”  
**23** *Over.* This inhumanity was not uncommon. Jos. 10:24. Ps. 109:1.  

---

## Chapter 52

**1** *Thee.* Judea was no more laid waste by its ancient enemies. The persecution of Epiphanes did not continue long. Many have attacked the Church; but they cannot overcome her, nor will she cease to preach the truth, and to continue pure and holy.  
**3** *Money.* The Chaldees acted impolitically in leaving the country without inhabitants, and Cyrus will derive no immediate advantage from your return. C.—The Jews had not injured the Chaldees, nor mankind the devil. But both had offended God, who out of mercy paid their ransom. W.  
**4** *Assyrian.* Pharao, (Sa. T.) or rather Nabuchodonosor, ( C.) and the princes of Assyria, who acted tyrannically. H.  
**5** *Long*, by the Chaldees, weak Jews, and strangers, who misconstrue my conduct towards my people, and represent it as the effect of injustice, or of weakness.  
**6** *Here.* Jesus Christ appears, the Redeemer foretold so long before.  
**7** *Peace.* He come like a conqueror to save his people. It may also be applied to the prophets and apostles, ( C.) as S. Paul explains it. Rom. 10:15. M.  
**8** *Watchmen*, prophets. The angels sung at the birth of Christ. Lu. 2:14.  
**10** *Arm.* The Saviour. Lu. 1:51.  
**11** *Lord*, the Levites departing from Babylon. 1 Esd. 1:7. Num. 3:6 and 4:5. &c. C.—S. Paul proves hence that communication with infidels in spiritual things is always unlawful. 2 Cor. 6:17. W.  
**13** *Servant*, Christ. In vain do the Jews attempt to apply this to any other. It is wonderful that Grotius should follow their steps, and understand Jeremias to be meant; though elsewhere he allows that the prophet speaks only of the Messias. De Verit. v. 19.—This author has been of great prejudice to religion. The Chaldee and many modern Jews have been compelled by evidence to apply this to the Messias. See Geir. &c. Jesus was pleased to assume the form of a servant. Phil. 2:7.  
**14** *Of men*, who have disfigured the countenance of our Saviour with buffets, &c. The Jews would not receive him under this abject form, though it had been foretold equally with his elevation. C.  
**15** *Sprinkle* with baptism, ( H.) and his manifold graces. C.—Sept. “so many nations shall wonder at him.” H.—*Mouth*, out of reverence. How many great princes have submitted to his yoke? C.—*Beheld.* The Gentiles ( M.) embrace the faith, at the sight of Christ’s miracles. C.

## Chapter 53

**1** *Revealed.* Who could have believed such things? The apostles complain how few were converted. Jo. 12:38. Rom. 10:16. C.—These would not submit, though the gospel was not against reason. W.  
**2** *Plant.* Hebrew also, “suckling child.” Sept. &c.—*Ground.* The blessed Virgin. C.—*Was.* Sept. “he had no appearance nor beauty. But his appearance was abject and deficient above all men; a,” &c.—*That we.* Lit. “and we have desired him.” Notwithstanding his abject condition, He was the desired of all nations, and by his wounds we are healed. H.—Some assert that the person of Christ was not beautiful, while others think that his wounds prevented it from being discerned. Salmeron would supply a negation from the first number: “We have not desired him.”  
**3** *Not.* The whole life of Christ was spent in the midst of poverty, and contradictions. Heb. 4:15. He has thus taught us to despise ourselves.  
**4** *Sorrows.* Healing them by his own afflictions. Mat. 8:15. Sickness is an effect of sin, which Jesus came to destroy. 1 Pet. 2:24—*Leper*, who was bound to have his face covered. v. 3. Lev. 13:45.—*God.* Payva (Def. Trin. iv.) assures us that many Jews were converted by the perusal of this chapter, and particularly of this verse, which may be rendered “as a God wounded and afflicted.” C.  
**5** *Healed.* He inculcates this important truth repeatedly. Christ nailed the hand-writing that was against us to the cross. Col. 2:14. H.  
**6** *Astray.* We belong to his fold. C. 40:11. Jo. 10:11. Lu. 15:4.—*Laid.* Sept. “abandoned him to our sins,” as to so many executioners; ( C.) “and he, because he had been abused, opened,” &c. H.  
**7** *Will.* The pagans were very attentive that the victim should not make much resistance. Macrob. iii. 5.  
**8** *Judgment*, or by an unjust and cruel judgment. H.—Heb. “from prison and judgment.” C.—Sept. “in humiliation, ( H.) or humility, his judgment was taken away,” or rescinded, by his glorious resurrection. S. Philip follows this version in explaining this passage to the eunuch. Acts 8:33.—*Generation*, from his eternal Father or from the Virgin, his incarnation, life, resurrection, or posterity in the Church. All these may be meant, and are inexplicable. C.  
**9** *Death.* Heb. “and he made his grave with the wicked *men*, and with the rich *man*, in his death.” H.—Grave and death seem to be transposed; and we might better read, “He was taken up with wicked men in his death, and with a rich man was his sepulchre.” This indeed is only a conjecture, but well grounded in the context. See Jos. 24:19. Kennicott.—Sept. “and I will give the wicked for his grave, and the rich men for his death.” H.—The *rich man* may denote the small number of Jews who embraced the faith. C.—They esteemed themselves rich, and were highly favoured by God; yet they were blinded, ( H.) and given up to the Romans, in punishment of their deicide. Mat. 27:25. The Church is gathered both from Jews and Gentiles. v. 10. C. S. Jer.—“He will send to hell the wicked,” (Chal.) who slew him. M.—Christ was buried where malefactors were generally, yet honourably, in the tomb of Joseph. W. Mat. 27:57.  
**10** *Bruise.* Sept. “to cleanse him from the wound.” H.—God was pleased that he should satisfy fro our crimes.—*Hand.* Christ has died for all, and established a Church which shall not perish.  
**12** *Many.* Even to the ends of the earth. Ps. 2:8.—*Strong.* Demons, Jews, &c. Heb. “with the strong” apostles.—*Wicked* thieves. Barabbas, &c.—*Transgressors.* His executioners. The gospel could not speak plainer. C.

## Chapter 54

**1** *Barren* Jews in captivity, or Church of the Gentiles, to which alone the expressions can be applied. C.—The Gentiles were before unfruitful, as the Jews will be till towards the latter times. W.  
**2** *Stakes*, to receive so great a family. All the Israelites did not return, and it does not appear that many embraced their religion, as they have done that of Christ.  
**3** *Left.* To the north and south. Jerusalem increased. But what was it compared with the Christians establishment!  
**4** *Widowhood.* Thy former excesses shall be forgotten. C.  
**5** *Thee.* Heb. “Bohalaic ( H.) *shall be* your Baalim,” or husband, who was styled *Lord.* 1 Pet. 3:6. Perhaps he may allude to the two wives, the synagogues and the Church, or to the idols, which should be adored no more.  
**6** *Yout* *h.* This enhances her fault. God is pleased to overlook it, in the captives (C. 50:1) and Gentiles.  
**9** *Earth.* Giving him the rainbow for a sign. My covenant with the Church is equally irrevocable: she is founded on a rock. Mat. 16:18. C.—Christ will no more abandon her than he will drown the world. Some mountains shall be moved out of their place, but she shall not. W.  
**11** *Sapphires.* Heb. “antimony,” a mineral shining like silver. 4 K. 9:30.  
**12** *Bulwarks.* Heb. windows of crystal; (Ezec. 27:16. C.) Prot. “of agate.” H.—All this is allegorical, like the redemption of the new Jerusalem. Apoc. 21.  
**13** *Lord*, Christ. Jer. 31:33. John 6:45.  
**14** *Thee.* The Cutheans rendered the Jews suspected. 1 Esd. 4:2. and 6:1  
**15** *To thee*, in the inheritance. This was verified in the Church. We have no accout of many being converted before.  
**16** *Destroy.* I can give peace or war. C.—Sept. “but I have created thee not for utter destruction.” H.

## Chapter 55

**1** *Waters*, which in that country are very scarce.—*Milk.* Sept. “fat.” C.—In the western Churches, *wine* and honey were given to the new baptized. C. 7:15. S. Jer.—Christ invites all to come to him. John 4:14,. and 7:37. The establishment of the Church is described under the figure of the return from Babylon. C.—Grace is offered to all. But only those are justified who *thirst*, and do their best. Mat. 5:6. W.  
**3** *David.* I will be equally faithful to you. Ps. 88:29. Sept. “*the holy things of David faithful.*” Acts 13:34. The resurrection of Christ fully accomplished the promise made to David.  
**4** *Him.* David, who continually proclaimed the divine mercies, (Ps. 17:1) or rather Christ; though Grotius alone would refer it to Jeremias. C.  
**5** *Not* with approbation. H.—The Gentiles are converted.  
**6** *Near.* He will shortly ( C.) *turn to the Gentiles.* John 12:35. Acts 13:46. H.  
**7** *Way.* This is a necessary preliminary to God’s service. W.  
**8** *My ways.* I am not vindictive, but require a sincere conversion. C.—We cannot serve both God and the world. We must therefore adhere to the former. W.  
**11** *Sent it.* I will assuredly bring you from Babylon; and the rain shall sooner return upwards than I will break my promise.  
**12** *Peace*, by strangers. C. 49:22.—*Hands*, for joy. C.—*Ipsa sonant arbusta Deus Deus ille, Menacla* *.* Virg. Ec. 5.  
**13** *Myrtle-tree.* Instead of the wicked, the just shall be seen. Chal.—*Away.* The conversion and sanctity of the Gentiles shall be a trophy to the Lord. M.  

---

## Chapter 56

**1** *Judgment*, the right resolution to do God’s will, which *justice* executes. C. 32. W.—*My justice.* Sept. “mercy.” Christ is at hand. Prepare for your deliverance, by keeping the commandments.  
**2** *Sabbath.* All the Jewish festivals, ( C.) as well as those of the Christian Church, ( H.) and the whole law. W.  
**3** *People.* The Jews would not admit all nations to their communion. Deut. 33:1. A little before Christ’s coming, they began to make more proselytes; (Mat. 23:15) and the sacred books being translated, came to the knowledge of the Gentiles, who were thus induced by degrees to embrace the true faith. The road to heaven was always open for those who kept the commandments, (v. 6. C.) though they might not receive circumcision. H.—Christ has removed the wall of separation, (Eph. 2:14. C.) and established *one fold* for all. Jo. 10. H.  
**4** *Eunuchs.* It was ignominious to have no children among the Jews, as the propagation of the true religion depended much on their numbers. But now, since the Church is gathered from all nations, virginity is preferable to marriage, and those who keep the *sabbath*, or all the commandments, and *choose* this state freely, will receive greater glory than the other *sons and daughters of* God. Against this plain meaning, P. Martyr (de Cœlib.) asserts that God prefers eunuchs only because before those who transgress the law. But he gives them *a place better* than his other *sons*, &c.! Prot. (Bib. 1603) understand that eunuchs *shall be called after* (or according to) *God’s people, and be of the same religion*, which implies no preference at all. They add, therefore, *yea, under Christ the dignity of the faithful shall be greater than the Jews were at that time;* as if the comparison were between God’s servants before and after Christ, and not between eunuchs and such as have children. How much better is it for us to follow the holy Fathers, who hence commend those who make a vow of perpetual chastity? They shall possess an excellent dignity among the angels. S. Bas. virg.—The rewards of continency are great, *eximia* *.* S. Cyr. Alex. hic.—“In the eternal mansion they are preferred before children.” S. Greg. past. iii. 29. &c. W.—Such spiritual eunuchs, as S. John the evangelist, are meant. “He hath chosen what the Lord would, that he should offer more than was commanded … He who is an eunuch, and performs all that is prescribed, shall have … the best place, so that he shall be a tower, and occupy the rank of a priest, and instead of children of the flesh, shall have many spiritual children.” S. Jer. H.—The law excluded eunuchs from the Church. Deut. 23:1. But under the gospel, they may enter heaven. Mat. 19 and 1 Cor. 7:32. &c. Daniel (1:3) and his companions were eunuchs, yet in high estimation; and virtuous eunuchs are commended. Wisd. 3:13. C.—*Choose.* Observing the commandments and counsels, like religious men. M.—Those who *choose* to do more than is commanded, will have a greater reward. W.  
**7** *Prayer.* So the temple is justly styled. H.—This shall be open to all nations. After the captivity, the Jews condescended to let the Gentiles have a court, and they even suffered some princes to go into the court of the priests. 2 Mac. 3:33. Physcon wished to penetrate into the inner sanctuary, (3 Mac. Eccli. 1) which could not be granted.  
**9** *Beasts.* Here a fresh discourse begins to C. 61. The Chaldees and Romans are invited to punish God’s people for their sins, committed before the captivity. Zac. 14:2. C.—The prophet foresees the negligence of some pastors, and denounces their rigorous chastisement. W.  
**10** *Watchmen.* Priests and prophets. C.—We know ( H.) only Jeremias who continued firm. Lam. 2:14. In the days of Christ, the corruption was not diminished. C.  
**11** *Last.* The *scribes devour t* *he houses of widows, making long prayers.* Mat. 23:14. *They are blind.* Mat. 15:14. H.  

---

## Chapter 57

**1** *The just.* Christ, ( C.) Josias, (Grot.) or any whose cause is just, yet finds no protection from such corrupt magistrates. H.—*Evil*, by the wicked, or to prevent his fall. 4 K. 12:20. People little consider what a loss the world sustains, when those die who might have averted the divine wrath. C.—They are usually taken away, that they may not witness such misfortunes, and are settled in eternal peace. W.  
**2** *Bed.* The grave which affords rest to the virtuous, Josias, &c. C.  
**3** *Sorceress.* Sept. “lawless” children. H.  
**4** *Tongue*, in contempt. Saints, and particularly Jesus Christ, have been exposed to ridicule.  
**5** *Comfort.* Heb. “heat,” abandoning yourselves to shameful excesses.—*Torrents*, to avoid being seen. Such sacrifices would have been incredible, if the Scriptures, and all history did not prove their existence. Deut. 12:31. Wisd. 12:3 and 4 K. 23:10.  
**6** *Them.* The stones *of the torrent*, which were often the objects of adoration. Lev. 26:1. Gen. 28:18. The god, Helagabalus, was a rough boundary stone.  
**7** *Bed*, like a shameless prostitute. The idols are generally represented in this light, as corrupting God’s people. C.  
**8** *Remembrance* *.* Domestic gods. S. Jer. The *Lares* or *Penates* were usually placed in the court or porch. The Jews probably used Hecate or Trivia, for the same purpose. C. 65:11 and 66:17. To prevent this impiety, God had ordered some of the law to be written on the doors. Deut. 6:9. But this it seems was disregarded. 4 K. 23:8 and 1 Mac. 1:58. Ezec. 8:5.—*Near me.* Idols were placed in the very temple. Jer. 35:15 and 4 K. 21:4. Ezec. 8:3 and 16:17. C.—*Hand.* Prot. “where thou sawest it.” Thou didst even invite thy lovers by presents. Ezec. 16:32. H.  
**9** *King.* Moloc, or ( C.) any foreign king, of whose alliance God did not approve. Theod.—To please them, the true religion was adulterated.  
**10** *Rest.* They were obstinate before the coming of Nabuchodonosor, and of the Romans.—*Asked.* Confiding in their own strength.  
**11** *Afraid*, since thou hast despised my, my laws and offers.  
**12** *Justice.* He speaks ironically. C.—Self-righteousness is vicious. H.  
**13** *Companies*, or princes, in whom thou hast confided. Assyria and Egypt cannot save themselves. C.  
**14** *And I.* Seeing there is no aid in man, God will save his people for his own goodness’ sake. H.  
**16** *End.* I will not always threaten or be angry. Gen. 6:3. C.—*Spirit.* Holy Ghost. S. Iræn. v. 12. S. Aug.—God spares the humble penitent, and grants what they desire with as much eagerness as a sailor does a fair wind. W.—He does not regard the indifferent. H.  
**17** *Heart.* Dreadful state of the abandoned sinner! Deut. 32:21. Ps. 12:2 and 43:24.  
**19** *Lips.* Whatever they could ask, so that they might sing canticles. All should be content. He alludes to the liberation of the captives, which was *near*, and to the redemption of mankind *far off.* C.  
**20** *Dirt.* Lit. “treading,” *conculcationem* *.* H.—The works of the wicked are fruitless. They have no content. C.  

---

## Chapter 58

**1** *Sins.* During the captivity. v. 11. S. Thomas.—Some will not hear, and those must be *rebuked* with *all patience*, till they follow virtue. W.  
**2** *Approach*, and contend with God, scrutinizing his conduct, (Prov. 25:27) and doing good for the sake of applause and self-interest.  
**3** *Will.* This alone suggested their fasts, and they did not shew compassion. Ezec. 7:2. C.—*Debtors*, who are not able to pay. S. Jer. Deut. 24:12.  
**4** *Strife.* The usual works were interrupted. The Church formerly forbade law-suits on fast-days.—*Fist.* Mat. 18:28.—*Wickedly.* Sept. “the humble.”  
**5** **Ver** **.** **5** **.** *Circle.* They affected extreme debility. Mat. 6:16. C.—*Ashes.* These external marks of penance are not condemned, but the want of corresponding sentiments. H.—Prot. would hence infer that fasting from flesh is not requisite, or a religious worship. But S. Jerom shews the contrary, provided it be joined with the observance of other commandments, as the saints and Christ himself have shewn us.  
**6** *Bands.* Contracts of usury, &c. C.  
**7** *Deal.* Lit. “break.” H.—Thin cakes are still used in the East.—*Flesh*, or relation. Gen. 27:27.  
**8** *Light.* Prosperity, ( C.) or Saviour. H.—Mat. 4:2 and John 1:8. C.—*Health.* Aquila, “the scar of thy wound shall soon be covered.” S. Jer.—*Up.* He shall close the rear, like the angel in the cloud. Ex. 13:21 and 14:19. He will grant thee rest from bondage in the grave and in heaven. C.  
**9** *Finger*, contemptuously, or threatening. S. Jer.—Some explain it of the ordaining sacred ministers, or taking another’s property.  
**10** *Soul*, effectually, and with love relieving the distressed. C.  
**11** *Fail.* Sept. Alex. adds, “and thy bones as a flower shall spring and grow fat, and shall inherit ages of ages.” S. Jerom says this is not in the best copies. H.  
**12** *Generation.* As the Jews did not comply with the condition, the Church falls heir to these promises.  
**13** *Sabbath*, doing no work, or refraining from the violation of festivals.—*Delightful.* We must not think the sabbath of the Lord a loss: (Amos 8:5) but rejoice in praising him. Ps. 45:11. C.—*A word*, or to apply to God’s word. Grot.—Pious reading on holidays is the duty of all who have an opportunity. H.  
**14** *Earth.* Judea. C.—Sept. “upon the good things of the land.” H.

## Chapter 59

**2** *Iniquities.* The history of Susanna shews that the captives were not all free from sin, which alone prevented their liberation. Lam. 3:44. C.—God is willing and able to save. He punishes for sin, to cause us to repent. v. 20. W.  
**4** *Justice.* They arraign unjustly. None call upon the just God, but trust in idols.—*Iniquity.* They kill themselves, while they strive to injure others. Ps. 7:15. Mic. 2:1.  
**5** Basilisk, or viper. C.—The young ones “burst through the viper’s sides.” Pliny x. 62.—So the works of the wicked are useless or destructive.  
**8** *Peace*, or prosperity. They quarrel with all, and ruin themselves. Ps. 13.  
**9** *Therefore.* The wicked Jews nevertheless confess that their sins prove their destruction.  
**10** *Dead.* The Jews will not recognize Christ, notwithstanding the prophecies and miracles.  
**11** *Judgment*, that God would avenge us, (v. 9) and regard our fasts. C. 58:3.  
**14** *In.* Where truth is disregarded, there can be no justice.  
**16** *Himself*, to arrest his arm, stretched out to chastise his son; or to second him. There is nothing in man to stop God’s vengeance. He therefore pardons out of his own goodness. C. 59:2 and 63:4. C.—He became man to redeem us, as no pure mortal could do it. W.  
**17** *Justice.* None can blame his conduct.  
**19** *On.* Heb. “is standard-bearer.” Aq. S. Jer.—Cyrus, the figurative redeemer, proceeds rapidly.  
**20** *To Sion.* Sept. “from Sion, and will turn away iniquity from Jacob. (21) And this,” &c. H.—S. Paul hence proves that the Jews will at last be converted. Rom. 11:26. The return of the captives prefigured this event. C.  
**21** *Covenant.* Note here a clear promise of perpetual orthodoxy to the Church of Christ. Ch.—She hath still the spirit of truth. W. Mat. 28:20.—None will apply this to the synagogue, which is visibly in the dark, and abandoned. C.

## Chapter 60

**1** *O Jerusalem*, is not in Heb. or S. Jer. but in the Sept. Some few things may refer to the terrestrial Jerusalem, though the prophet speaks chiefly of the celestial and of the Church.—*Lord*, very great. Christ came to save us. C.—God prevents by his grace, but man must co-operate to be justified. W.  
**2** *People.* Babylon shall suffer, while thou art relieved. C.—The Gentiles continue in darkness till they embrace the faith. v. 3. H.—Only those who are in the Church receive the light of truth. W.  
**3** *Rising.* The three wise men were the first.  
**4** *Rise up.* S. Jer. “suck,” as the Heb. may imply. C.—Sept. “shall be carried on the shoulders.” H.—This may refer to the captives and to the Church.  
**5** *Wonder.* Heb. and Sept. in S. Jerom, “fear.” This sensation is often mixed with joy. Mat. 28:8.—*Thee.* No such nations joined the Jews, as they did the Church.  
**6** *Epha.* Abraham’s grandson, who dwelt near his father, Madian, in Arabia, which was famous for camels. C.—*Saba* *.* India mittit ebur, molles sua thura Sabæi? Geor. i.—The Arabians embraced the gospel, but never brought their treasures to Jerusalem. C.—The three kings came on swift beasts to adore Christ, and fulfilled his prophecy. Mat. 2. W.  
**7** *Cedar* and *Nabaioth* sprung from Ismael, and dwelt in desert Arabia, under tents, feeding flocks. S. Jer. Ezec. xxvii. 21.—They also were converted to Christ.  
**8** *Clouds.* They are thy children, accompanied by strangers.  
**9** *Afar.* All nations shall receive the gospel. Many made presents to the temple, after the return of the Jews. C.—The islands, Great Britain, &c. embrace the faith. Tert. Orig. Ven. Bede, S. Chrys. &c. W.  
**10** *To thee.* The Persians monarchs ( C.) were mostly favourable to the Jews. H.—The Gentiles help to form the Church, which rejects no one. v. 11.  
**12** *Desolation.* Though the Machabees conquered several nations, this can only be verified in the Church of Christ, to which God has subjected all; so that out of his faith none can be saved. Heb. 2:8.  
**13** *Glory;* cedar, which was chiefly used in building the temple. 1 Esd. 3:7. C.—This must be explained of the saints, who founded the Church, &c. S. Jer.—Emperors became Christians, with the most potent nations. W.  
**14** *Feet.* Prot. “shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet.” This posture is not then essentially idolatrous. H.—Jerusalem shall be rebuilt by those who destroyed it. C. 49:17. It is not easy to prove this of the earthly city: but the pagans, who persecuted the Church, have embraced her communion, and begged to receive baptism.  
**16** **V** **er.** **16** **.** *Kings.* Thou shalt be treated like royal babes. C. 49:23. C.—Sept. “and thou shalt eat the riches of kings.” H.  
**17** *Visitation.* Sept. “give thy chiefs in peace, and thy bishops in justice.” S. Clement (ad Cor.) reads, “I will appoint their bishops in justice, and their deacons in faith.” C.—The Scripture thus specifies the name and duties of the pastors of the Church S. Jer.  
**18** *G* *ates.* Jerusalem was not less corrupt after the captivity than before, if we except idolatry. C.—Heaven alone enjoys a perfect peace and freedom from sin, (S. Cyr. &c.) though the Church is always *holy* *.* H.  
**19** *Thou shalt*, &c. In this latter part of the chapter, the prophet passes from the illustrious promises made to the Church militant on earth, to the glory of the Church triumphant in heaven. Ch.—*Glory.* S. John seems to have copied this. Apoc. 18. &c.  
**22** *The least* of the apostles shall bring many converts, ( C.) or shall be spiritual ( H.) governor of a great city, (Mic. 5:2) in the Church militant. C.—A small shoot, or family, in the Church, shall produce many others. M.

## Chapter 61

**1** *Lord.* Heb. adds, “God.” Adonai seems to have been inserted to prevent the pronunciation of Jehovah, (Kennicott) which alone occurs in the Sept. Arab. and in S. Luke, 4:18. H.—Thus Elohim may have been substituted for Jehovah, Gen. 22:8 as v. 14, “Abraham called the name of that place *Jehovah jireh*, because he had said that day on the mount: Jehovah will provide” a victim, even Jesus Christ in the same place. *Perhaps* no part of the Bible is “so absurdly translated” as this, (Ken.) by *Protestants.* H.—S. Luke follows the Sept. in his quotation, only instead of *to preach a*, &c. he has an explanation, *to set at liberty them that are bruised.* Isaias may here speak of himself, (Chal.) yet only as a figure of Christ. The Jews admit that the Messias is meant. Christ had received the Holy Spirit at the Jordan. John 1:32. He performed these works, (Lu. 7:22) particularly addressing his discourse to the meek and poor. Soph. 3:12. Zac. 11:7 and 1 Cor. 1:26. C.—He was not anointed with oil, like Aaron, but with the Holy Ghost; so that *of his fullness* others must receive. Acts 10:39. &c. W.  
**2** *Year* of Jubilee, (Jer. 25:11) when the Jews should be delivered, as a figure of Christ’s redemption.—*Vengeance*, when the Chaldees, &c. should perish, ( C.) and all obstinate sinners, at the day of judgment. H.  
**3** *Glorify.* The rulers shall act with justice. C. 60:17, 21.  
**4** *Ruins*, as the Jews did. C. 58:12. The apostles preached to the Gentiles, who had been long neglected.  
**5** *Vines.* Bishops were soon chosen from among the Gentiles. The Machabees subdued the neighbouring nations. 1 Mac. 15:28.  
**6** *Priests.* They were greatly honoured, (Ex. 19:6) so that the sons of David had the appellation. The Jews had still to labour as before. Christians become heirs to these promises, and are styled a royal priesthood. 1 Pet. 2:9. Apoc. 1:6. They have received the Scriptures from the Jews, and employ human sciences for the advancement of religion. The wisest pagans yield to the force of truth.  
**7** *Part:* God, or the *land.* Converts shall bless God for having withdrawn them from the crowd of infidels, and they will rejoice in suffering for his sake, ( C.) preferring their lot before that of unbelievers. Before this change the apostles grieved. W.  
**8** *Holocaust.* The pagans saw such things were improper victims. Eus. præp. iv. 14.—Sept. “hate unjust plunder.” H.—Therefore will I subject the strangers to you. v. 5.—*Truth.* I will grant a sure reward.—*Covenant.* These of Nehemias and the Machabees were soon forgotten: but Christ’s covenant shall abide for ever.  
**9** *Blessed.* The Jews are visibly the reverse. The Church flourishes in spite of domestic and foreign enemies.  
**10** *Jewels.* Apoc. 21:2. Jerusalem, or rather the Church, praises God.  
**11** **Ver** **.** **11** **.** *Nations*, whose conversion is implicitly foretold. All behold the justice which God has treated both his people and their oppressors. C.  

---

## Chapter 62

**1** *Rest*, as long as God grants me life, or till I behold the Saviour; or Cyrus, the figure of Christ. C.—True preachers will not be silent on account of any threats, but will labour for the Church. 2 Tim. 2. W.  
**2** *One.* No profane historian mentions what Cyrus did for the Jews; but all the world knows how much Christ has favoured his Church. C.—*Name.* Thou shalt be no longer the rebellious Jerusalem, but the spouse and chosen people, the Church of Christ. S. Ignat. ad Magnes. S. Jer.  
**3** *Hand.* Chal. “before.” Heb. “by the protection.”  
**4** *Forsaken.* Yet the synagogue was again rejected, at the death of Christ. The promises naturally relate to his Church. C.—*Inhabited.* Prot. retain the Heb. words Chephtsi-bah, “my delight in her,” and *Beulah*, (marg.) “married.” H.  
**5** **V** **er.** **5** **.** *Dwell.* Heb. “marry.” They shall be attached to their country.—*Thee.* He shall love thee as a bridegroom does one whom he has lately married. Christ never abandons his virgin spouse. C.—Isaias speaks of some state of the Jews which has not yet taken place. Houbigant.  
**6** *Watchmen;* priests and prophets, (Mat. 2:1. Ps. 133:2. C.) or angels. S. Jer. S. Bern.—The synagogue has long been destitute of guides, but the Catholic Church has an uninterrupted succession of watchful pastors.—*Mindful* whose duty it is to remind him of his promises, and to recite the Church office. C.—Heb. mazcirim, monitors. 2 K. 8:16. H.—In these faithful watchman the Church is always visible. W.  
**8** *Hand;* inviolably. Deut. 32:40. The Persians deemed this oath most sacred. C.—Darius just expiring, said to Polycrates, “By thee I give this right hand to Alexander,” (Plut.) that he may revenge my death.—*Wine.* The Church cannot be deprived of her faith or of her God.  
**10** *People*, that they may return to Judea, and be converted to Christ. C.  
**11** *Work* the redemption of mankind. H.—Though Cyrus was a figure of Christ, he was as much beneath him as earth is below heaven. Zac. 9:9. C.  

---

## Chapter 63

**1** Edom*.* Edom and Bosra (a strong city of Edom) are here taken in a mystical sense for the enemies of Christ and his Church. Ch.—S. Jerom with reason finds it difficult to explain it of Christ, as it regards the Machabees. Houbigant.—The first six verses are applied to our Saviour’s ascension, which excites the admiration of angels. Ps. 23:7. Judas, the Machabee, the glorious figure of Christ, is introduced speaking in this and the following chapter. He conquered Idumea, (1 Mac. 5:3 and 2 Mac. 10:10) and fought *to save* the people. 1 Mac. 9:21. C.—The highest order of angels asks this question, admiring the beauty of Christ, though imbrued in blood after his victory. S. Dionys. Hierar. vii. W.  
**3** *Press.* Christ suffered, (S. Cyr.) and punished his enemies, Apocalypse 14:19. Judas received God’s sword from Jeremias, (2 Mac. 15:15) and liberated his people.  
**5** *Me.* I depended on the goodness of my cause, and on God’s aid. C. 59:15. C.  
**6** *Drunk* with the wine of my fury. Ps. 74:9. Ezec. 23:31. H.  
**7** *I*, Isaias; or rather the hero mentions what induced him to rise up. 1 Mac. 16:10. C.—The Jews confess God’s mercies. S. Jer.  
**8** *Deny*, or prove degenerate. C.—God approves the conduct of the Machabees. H.  
**9** *Presence*, in high authority. Ex. 33:20. C.—The angel guardian of the Church. Particular guardians also see God’s face. Mat. 18. W.  
**10** *One;* Moses. Num. 14:29 and 20:3, 12.  
**11** *Flock.* Ps. 76:21.—*One.* Moses inspired by God. C.  
**13** *Not*, the road was so plain. Wisd. 19:7. H.  
**15** *Back.* This is spoken by the prophet in the person of the Jews, at the time when for their sins they were given up to their enemies. Ch.—Judas uses the same language at Maspha. 1 Mac. 3:50. C.  
**16** *Abraham*, &c. That is, Abraham will not now acknowledge us for his children, by reason of our degeneracy; but thou, O Lord, art our true father and our redeemer, and no other can be called our parent in comparison with thee. Ch.—Abraham is not able to save us. C.—The patriarchs may justly disregard us, as degenerate children; yet we hope in God’s mercies. Thus S. Jerom, &c. explain the passage, which does not favour the errors of Vigilantius and of Luther, who maintain that the saints departed do not know what passes in this world. S. Aug. (Cura xv.) shews the contrary, from the example of Lazarus, Luke 16. They know each other, though they had not lived together, (S. Greg. Dial. iv. 33.) and beheld in the light of God what regards their clients. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. xxii. 29. We cannot decide how the martyrs do help those whom it is certain they assist. S. Aug. cura xvi. c. Faust. xx. 21. S. Jer. c. Vigil. S. Greg. 3 ep. 30. and 7 ep. 126. &c. W.  
**17** *Hardened*, &c. The meaning is, that God, in punishment of their great and manifold crimes, and their long abuse of his mercy and grace, had withdrawn his graces from them, and so given them up to error and hardness of heart. Ch.—They had abused his patience, to sin the more. Theodoret—The Jews are accustomed to attribute all to God, though they agree with us in reality God might prevent any sin. C.—But he chooses to leave man to the free exercise of his liberty. He hardens ( H.) “not by infusing malice, but by not shewing mercy; and those to whom he shews it not, are undeserving.” S. Aug. ep. ad Sixt. cxciv. 14.—God is never the author of error. Man takes occasion from his indulgence to become obdurate. S. Jer. W.  
**18** *Nothing;* holding them in the greatest contempt. Epiphanes though he should make them easily change their religion. His persecution lasted only three years and a half.—*Sanctuary.* 1 Mac. 1:23. 49. 57 and 3:45.  
**19** *Name.* We seem to have no distinction, temple, &c. C.—Prot. “We *are thine.* Thou never bearest rule over them. They were,” &c. H.  

---

## Chapter 64

**1** *Presence*, as at Sinai. Ex. 19:16. Judg. 5:4. Judas continues to pray. C.—The faithful sigh for Christ’s coming. H.—All good people desired it most fervently. W.  
**2** *They.* Sept. “As wax melts before the fire, *so* also fire will burn the adversaries, and thy,” &c. H.—*Burn.* Sparks of fire seem to proceed from it.  
**3** *Bear.* Ex. 20:18. Heb. “expect.” Judas appeared victorious, when the nation was prostrate.  
**4** *Thee.* Never was deliverance more unexpected or miraculous. S. Paul quotes this passage, to shew the wisdom manifested in the incarnation. 1 Cor. 2:9. It is commonly applied to the glory of heaven.  
**5** *Thee.* The little band of Judas was sincerely attached to the Lord. 2 Mac. 1:3.—*Sinned.* This excited thy anger. Yet thou wilt shew mercy. Sin is often put for punishment. C.—*Vau* means also, “for, and, yet.” Prot. “for we have sinned.” But we follow S. Jer. and the Vulg. W.  
**6** *Unclean:* leper. Grot. Lev. 13:45.—*Justices.* That is, the works by which we pretended to make ourselves just. This is spoken particularly of the sacrifices, sacraments, and ceremonies of the Jews, after the death of Christ, and the promulgation of the new law. Ch.—The justice which is under the law is stated uncleanness, when compared with evangelical purity. Phil. 3:8.—“If any one after the gospel … would observe the ceremonies of the law, let him hear the people confessing that all that justice is compared to a most filthy rag.” S. Jer.—The good works which are done by grace, and not by man alone, cannot be said to be of this description. They constitute the internal glory of man, and God will one day crown these his gifts. Of ourselves indeed we can do nothing, and the works of the Mosaic law will not avail, as S. Paul inculcates; but those works, point out the saint, which are preformed by *charity* with *faith* in Christ. This justice is not imputed only, but real; and shews where true faith exists, according to S. James. Thus the apostles explain each other. H.—*Woman.* Sept. “of one sitting down;” like Rachel. Gen. 31:35. Sym. “lying-in.” Aq. “of proofs.” Grot. “like a plaster on a sore, which is thrown away.” Such were Alcimus, &c. C.—To practise ( H.) the Jewish rites would now be sinful. M.  
**7** *Of thee;* to remove thy indignation, like Moses, Jeremias, (7:15.) &c. See Ezec. 13:5.  
**10** *Desolate*, under Antiochus Epiphanes. 1 Mac. 1:31 and 4:38. C.  

---

## Chapter 65

**1** *Me.* God answers the preceding prayer, and announces the rejection of the synagogue, alluding to the armies which prevailed in the days of the Machabees.—*Not.* S. Paul explains this of the conversion of the Gentiles. Rom. 10:20. C.—It cannot regard the Jews, who are spoken of in the next verse. W.  
**3** *Gardens*, to the impure Venus and Adonis.—*Bricks*, to the *Manes.* C.—  
**4** *Idols:* to have dreams, (Strabo xvi.) and commit impurities.—*Broth* of swine’s flesh, which was prohibited. Lev. 11:7.  
**5** *Unclean.* Thus acted the hypocritical Pharisees.—*Smoke.* A just punishment of those who had sought the smoke of human applause.  
**6** *Bosom:* good measure. Lu. 6:38. Rewards and punishments will be eternal.  
**7** *Hills.* Some offered sacrifices to God, others to idols; both unlawfully. C.  
**8** *Whole.* The good grain is preserved amid the general corruption. H.—A few of the Jews were chosen to believe in Christ.  
**9** *Mountains* of Judea, (Deut. 3:25) which the captives shall recover, as a figure of those who shall embrace the Christian faith.  
**10** *Plains.* Heb. Sharon, in the land of Basan.—*Achor*, near Jericho, called after Achan, ( C.) who perhaps was more correctly styled Achor. Jos. 7:26. Osee 2:15. H.  
**11** *Fortune.* Heb. “Gad,” the sun. Gen. 30:11.—*Upon it.* Sym. “without me.” Sept. “to fortune.” Heb. “to Meni,” the moon, or Queen of heaven. Jer. 7:18 and 44:17. C.  
**12** *Chosen.* Free-will is clearly expressed, as rewards are, v. 13. W.  
**13** *Servants;* Christians, ( C.) particularly the elect. H.—When the Romans approached Jerusalem, the Christians retired to Pella, and had plenty. Houbigant.  
**15** *Execration.* They can wish to be preserved from nothing worse.—*Name.* The faithful shall be no longer called Jews. C.—They shall be hated, while the name of Christian shall point out God’s servants. W.  
**16** *Amen*, or “of truth.” False gods shall be neglected. They shall not swear by them, as formerly. Soph. 1:5.—Christ usually adopted the asseveration, *Amen, Amen*, to enforce his truths. H.  
**17** *New earth*, in eternity, (Clarius) or here indeed, (2 Pet. 3:3. &c. Houbigant) having purified the former by the general conflagration, which many assert will take place at the end of 6,000 years. S. Jer. S. Aug. &c. At the return of the captives, the country flourished again under the Machabees; (v. 18. Grot.) or rather the gospel changes the face of the earth. C. 66:22. C. Forerius.—After the resurrection the qualities, and not the substance, of the world, will be changed. W.  
**20** *Fill up.* To die soon was deemed a misfortune. Ps. 54:24. Ex. 20:12. Virtue is the measure of the Christian’s life, and God will reward those who labour even late. Mat. 20:13.—*Accursed.* This age will not be spared. Both just and wicked shall be immortal in eternity. Theod.  
**22** *A tree.* Sept. “of the tree of life.” Jer. 18:8. C.—*Continuance.* Heb. “My elect shall long enjoy the works,” &c. H.—They shall not build for others to enjoy.  
**23** *In.* Heb. “for trouble.” Chal. “death.” Sept. “malediction.” The children shall not be cut off; and baptism shall secure their salvation.  
**25** *Straw.* People of the most perverse tempers shall become mild by the influence of the gospel, and shall dwell together in perfect concord. C.—*Food*, according to the sentence. Gen. 3:14. M.—The devil’s power is abridged. C. 11:6. C.—The proudest Gentiles are converted, and adopt the mild manners of Christians, in fasting and mortification. W.

## Chapter 66

**1** *House.* This is a prophecy that the temple should be cast off. Ch.—Isaias alludes to the return of the captives, as to a figure of the Church. They had flattered themselves with the idea of building a magnificent temple. God regards it not, as long as they follow their own wills and cherish pride. C.—He is pleased with the piety of his servants, which may be exhibited any where, though the temple is the most proper place. See Acts 7 and 14. After the gospel, the sacrifices of the law became unlawful. W.  
**3** *He.* Sept. “the wicked who.” H.—*Ox.* This is a prophecy, that the sacrifices which were offered in the old law, should be abolished in the new; and that he offering of them should be a crime. Ch.—Without the proper dispositions, sacrifice only displeases God. C.—*Brain*, or slay. H.—*Incense.* To offer it in the way of a sacrifice; ( Ch.) or to remind God of his people. The expression is popular, but energetic. Lev. 2:2, 9. and 6:15.—*Ways*, to please themselves, and to bind me. But I will not have a divided heart. C. 1:11 and 58:3. C.  
**4** *Mockeries.* I will turn their mockeries upon themselves; and will cause them to be mocked by their enemies. Ch.  
**5** *Brethr* *en*, the Idumeans, &c. or the Jews, who would not believe in Christ.  
**6** *Lord*, who is about to quit the temple, and to abandon the Jews to their internal dissensions, and to the arms of the Romans. Many prodigies announced this judgment. C.—One Jesus cried for seven years and five months, “Woe to the temple,” &c. At last he cried, “Woe to myself;” when he was shot dead. Jos. Bel. vii. 12. Tacit. Hist. v.—Angels were heard crying in the temple, “Let us go hence.” Jos.—There was *contradiction in the city.* Ps. 54. S. Jer. W.  
**7** *Before*, &c. This relates to the conversion of the Gentiles, who were born as it were all on a sudden to the Church of God. Ch.—Sion furnished the first preachers of the Gospel. H.  
**8** *Day.* Shall a whole nation be born at once? Twelve fishermen effect the most surprising change in the manners of the world.  
**9** *God.* His grace converts the nations. C.  
**10** *For her.* Ye shall be comforted, ( H.) when the captives return, and the gospel is propagated.  
**12** *You.* S. Paul fed the weak with milk. 1 Cor. 3:2. Heb. 5:12 and 1 Pet. 2:2.  
**14** *Herb*, in baptism and the resurrection.—*Enemies*, the Chaldees, infidel Jews, and all the reprobate. v. 15. How many miracles were wrought by Christian preachers! Persecutors have come to an untimely end. C.—Before judgment, the world shall be consumed. W.  
**16** *Many. Few are chosen.* H.—All the wicked shall perish eternally. M.  
**17** *Within* the court, or gardens, where they purified themselves, foolishly supposing that this would remove their crimes, as the pagans did. S. Jer. Tert. Bapt. v.—Instead of *gate*, S. Jerom wrote *unam*, “one,” moon or Hecate, which is obviously derived from Heb. Achat*.* C. 57:8 and 65:11. Chal. Syr. &c. “gardens, one after another with those who eat,” &c.—*Mouse*, or “field-rat,” (Bochart) all declared unclean; (Lev. 11:7. 29. C.) or, “the dor-mouse,” (S. Jer.) which was looked upon as a delicacy by the Romans. Varro iii. 15. Pliny xxxvi. 1.  
**18** *Gather them*, thoughts, &c. All is personified in poetry. The Gentiles shall witness my judgments. C.  
**19** *Sign;* the cross, which Christ left to enlighten us, (Ezec. 9. S. Jer. W.) or the gospel, with the power of working miracles. Some Jews shall be saved, and shall preach to others, as God’s servants.—*Sea.* Heb. “Tharsis, to Phul *in Thebais*, Lud, (*Ethiopians.* Bochart) *who were* expert archers.” Sept. “Mosoch.”—*Italy.* Heb. “Thubal;” denoting Italy, Spain, Iberia, &c.—*Greece.* Heb. “Javan;” who peopled Ionia and the Archipelago. *Islands*, near Asia, ( C.) and all distant places. Parkhurst, p. 4. H.—Men of all nations shall be converted, and brought by angels to the Church. S. Jer. W.  
**20** *Brethren*, as the converts may justly be styled. C.—*Coaches*, (*carrucis* *.*) Heb. circaroth, ( H.) “dromedaries,” (Bochart) “with songs of praise.” Chal. &c. The precise import is unknown. Truth shall shew its sweet force.—*Offering;* the first-fruits, brought by all with great solemnity. Deut. 26:4 and 2 Thes. 2:12. C.  
**21** **Ver** **.** **21** **.** *Of them*, Gentiles; (v. 19) some of whom alone will be properly priests, though all enjoy the title in a figurative sense. 1 Pet. 2:9. The Jews strive in vain to elude this text. C.—Under the law, one family alone enjoyed this honour: but Christ chooses the most deserving pastors. W.  
**22** *Name.* The faith and morals of Christianity shall subsist for ever, like the gospel, which is termed *t* *he new heavens.* C. 65:17. Mat. 16:18.  
**23** *Sabbath.* Grotius explains this of the Gentiles, who should come to Jerusalem. But this was never realized before the propagation of the gospel. The Jews came thrice a-year. Christians shall attend the sacred mysteries every week. Ex. 13:14. Mal. 1:11.  
**24** *Men;* rebellious Jews and persecutors, who perish miserably.—*Flesh.* Josephus (Bel. vi. 16.) describes the horrors of the last siege of Jerusalem. The prophet may allude to the fires kept up in the vale of Hinnon; (C. 30:33) and our Saviour applies this text to the damned. Mark 9:43. All shall condemn them. C.
