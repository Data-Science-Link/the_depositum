# Hosea Commentary

**Osee**, or Hosea, whose name signifies *a saviour*, was the first in the order of time among those who are commonly called *lesser prophets*, because their prophecies are short. He prophesied in the kingdom of Israel, (that is, of the ten tribes) about the same time that Isaias prophesied in the kingdom of Juda. Ch.—The chronological order is not observed in any edition. The Sept. very from the rest. They place the less before the greater prophets, and read some of the names rather differently, as Prot. do also, though they have nothing but novelty to recommend the change. We shall here specify the Prot. names, ( H.) in the order in which these prophets appeared: ( C.) 1. Hosea, 2. Amos, 3. Jonah, 4. Micah, 5. Nahum, 6. Joel, 7. Zephaniah, 8. Habakkuk, 9. Obadiah, 10. Haggai, 11. Zechariah, 12. Malachi. H.—It is not known who collected them into one volume. but the book of Ecclesiasticus (49:12) speaks of *the twelve;* and 4 Esd. 1:39 specifies them as they are found in the Sept. Osee, Amos, Micheas, Joel, Abdias, Jonas, Nahum, &c. as in the Vulg. C.—Many other prophets appeared before these, ( W.) but Osee is the first of the sixteen whose works are extant. He must have continued his ministry about eighty-five years, and lived above one hundred and ten, if the first verse speaks of him alone. But some take it to regard the whole collection, and may be added by another hand. C.—The style of Osee is sententious and very hard to be understood, (S. Jer.) as but little is known of the last kings of Israel, in whose dominions he lived, and to whom he chiefly refers, though he speaks sometimes of Juda, &c. C.—By taking a wife, and other parables, he shews their criminal conduct and chastisment, and foretells their future deliverance and the benefits to be conferred by Christ. We must observe that the prophets often style the kingdom of the two tribes, Juda, Benjamin, Jerusalem, or the house of David; and that of the ten tribes, Ephraim, Joseph, Samaria, Jezrahel, Bethel, or Bethaven; and often Israel or Jacob till after the captivity of these tribes, when the latter titles refer to Juda, who imitated the virtues of Jacob better than the other kingdom. W.—Then all distinction of this nature was at an end. H.

## Chapter 1

**1** *Israel.* He reigned forty-one years, till A.M. 3220. Usher.—The prophets usually give the date, that the prediction may be verified. Some Latin MSS. intimate, that “the Jews attribute these titles to Esdras, (who is Malachias) or to the respective prophets, which is more probable.” S. Jer. t. i.—Jeroboam II. died twenty-six years before Ozias, towards the end of whose reign Isaias commenced; so that Osee was more ancient. W.  
**2** *Fornications.* That is, a wife that hath been given to fornication. This was to represent the Lord’s proceedings with his people Israel, who, by spiritual fornication, were continually offending him. Ch.—The prophet reclaimed her. S. Jer.—She denoted Samaria, abandoned to idolatry. Ezec. 16:15. Several such actions were prophetical. Many have supposed that this was only a parable; but the sequel proves the contrary. C.—*Of fornications.* So called from the character of the mother, if not also from their own wicked dispositions. Ch.—He is ordered to marry a woman who had been of a loose character, and to have children who would resemble her; ( W.) or he takes her children to his house; (Grot.) unless the children of the prophet were so styled because the mother had been given to fornication. So the *rod* of Aaron retains its name when it was become a *serpent* *.* Ex. 7:12.—*Shall*, or rather, “has departed;” and therefore he denounces future chastisements.  
**4** *Jezrahel.* Jehu slew Joram in this place. He was the instrument of God’s justice, yet acted himself through malice and ambition, and was therefore deservedly punished. Zacharias, the fourth of his family, lost the crown, and was slain by Sellum, at Jezrahel. 4 K. 9 &c. C.—The offspring of Jehu, now on the throne, solicited Jezrahel or the ten tribes to idolatry, which God will revenge. W.  
**6** *Without mercy. Lo Ruchamah.* Ch.—Some copies of Sept. and S. Paul read, “not beloved.” Rom. 9:25. Samaria shall surely perish. After the death of Jeroboam II. the kingdom was all in confusion, and in sixty-two years time became extinct. It was afterwards blended with Juda.  
**7** *Horsemen.* Sennacherib was miraculously disconcerted. Juda returned from captivity and became more flourishing, giving birth to the Messias. C.  
**9** *Not my people. Lohammi.* Ch.—The kingdom of Israel seemed to be quite cast off; and in captivity it was hardly distinguished from other nations. Juda was preserved longer, and at all times was under the divine protection. Ezechiel, Daniel, &c. comforted the people in the worst of their afflictions. C.  
**10** *The number*, &c. viz. of the true Israelites, the children of the Church of Christ. Ch.—This is the primary sense. Rom. 9:25. Yet the Israelites are here also assured of their return from captivity. C.—*God.* Among many sinners, some are chosen. W.  
**11** *Head;* Christ, ( Ch.) the head of all the faithful, ( W.) consisting both of Jews and Gentiles. Israel and Juda returned under Zorobabel, &c. C.—The prophets blend present and future transactions together. S. Jer. in C. iii.—*Jezrahel.* That is, of the seed of God; for Jezrahel signifies the seed of God. Ch.—*For* may also be rendered, “when or though.” The seed of Jehu shall be exterminated. The kingdom, signified by Jezrahel, a great city, shall fall. C.

## Chapter 2

**1** *Brethren*, &c. Or, *call your brethren, My people; and your sister, Her that hath obtained mercy.* This is connected with the latter end of the foregoing chapter, and relates to the converts of Israel. Ch.—I seemed to have abandoned them at *the great day* of carnage; ( H.) but I will still receive ( C.) this portion of my people, as well as Juda. H.—Disdain not to call them brethren. More of the ten tribes than of the others embraced the faith of Christ, and more Gentiles than Jews became converts. W.  
**2** *Your mother:* the synagogue. C.—He addresses Juda, (v. 11, 15) or all God’s people. C. 1:11. This vineyard yields no good fruit. Is. 5 Idolatry prevails. Ezec. 16:5 and 23:3.  
**3** *Drought.* In Egypt the people were plunged into idolatry, and oppressed. C.  
**4** *Fornication* *s.* They imitate their parents. H.—I will not spare them, as I did some in the wilderness. S. Jer.—Punishment will not cease till people repent. W.  
**5** *Lovers:* idols, and foreign nations. Ezec. 16:15, 33.  
**6** *Paths.* The aid which she sought from foreigners shall prove vain.—It is often an effect of mercy, when our wicked plans miscarry. S. Jer.  
**8** *Baal:* or they formed idols.  
**9** *Se* *ason.* When the harvest is ripe, the loss is more afflicting. God withdraws what proves an occasion of sin.—*Liberty.* The creature serves unwillingly. Rom. 8:21.  
**10** *Folly*, or shame. Gen. 34:7. Judg. 19:23.  
**11** *Times.* This was verified during the captivity.  
**13** *Ear.* Heb. “nose-ring,” or ornaments hanging from the nose. C.  
**14** *I will allure her*, &c. After her disloyalties, I will still allure her by my grace, &c. and send her *vine-dressers*, viz. the apostles, originally her own children, who shall *open* to her the gates of *hope;* as heretofore, at her coming into the land of promise, she had all good success after she had satisfied the divine justice by the execution of Achan, in the valley of Achor. Jos. 7. Ch.—Sept. “I will seduce *or* make her stray;” πλανω. H.—I will permit her to yield to error, in captivity; (Theod.) or will cause her hopes to be frustrated yet in exile I will comfort her. The Jews were not changed till they had seen the vanity of idols, and suffered much. C.—God’s grace prevents sinners, that they may be converted. W.  
**15** *Vine.* Heb. “vineyards there,” ( C.) or “from,” &c. H.—*Achor.* The environs of Jericho were very enchanting. Is. 65:10.—*Sin* *g* is better than Sept. “shall be humbled.” Heb. “shall answer,” as people singing alternately. C.  
**16** *My husband.* In Heb. Ishi*.*—*Baali* *:* my lord. The meaning of this verse is: that, whereas, Ishi and *Baali* were used indifferently in those days by wives speaking to their husbands, the synagogue, whom God was pleased to consider as his spouse, should call him only Ishi, and abstain from the name of *Baali*, because of his affinity with the name of the idol *Baal.* Ch.—The very name shall become obsolete. H.  
**17** *Baalim.* It is the plural number of Baal; for there were divers idols of Baal. Ch.—The Jews hence styled Esbaal, Isboseth; as *boseth* means “confusion.” 1 Par. 8:33.  
**18** *Beasts.* The most savage nations shall receive the gospel, and become mild. Is. 11:6. Theod.—Wild beasts shall not infest the land. Lev. 26:22. C.  
**19** *I will espouse thee*, &c. This relates to the happy espousals of Christ with his Church, which shall never be dissolved. Ch.—God gives the dowry, *justice*, &c.  
**20** *Faith*, the root of all virtues. We shall be true to each other. This has been realized only in the Church of Christ. C.  
**21** *Hear the heavens*, &c. All shall conspire in favour of the Church, which in the following verse is called *Jezrahel*, that is, *the seed of God.* Ch.—Harmony shall subsist between all the parts of the universe. The earth shall receive rain, &c. This happiness was enjoyed in figure by the Jews, after their return, and in reality by Christians. Theod.  
**22** *Jezrahel.* This most fruitful valley shall again be covered with abundant crops. The whole nation of the Jews shall be happy. C.  
**24** *That which is not my people*, &c. This relates to the conversion of the Gentiles, ( Ch.) as the apostles explain it. 1 Pet. 2:10. Rom. 9. W.

## Chapter 3

**1** *Woman.* This second woman denotes the penitent Israel, yet not quite reconciled. The people in captivity are separated both from her idols and from God, though the latter still retains an affection for them. Osee does not marry this woman, but gives his word. We must not urge the parable too far. He acts as a figure of the Lord, who had received an outrage. C.—Grace is still offered to sinners, whose persons are never hated by God. W.—*Husks.* Sept. &c. “cakes made with grapes,” for idols. Theod. S. Jer.  
**2** *Core.* Sept. “gomor of barley, and for a nebel of wine.” The woman must consequently have been of very mean condition. In the East wives are still, even among Christians, purchased according to their rank, often without being seen or consulted. The parents give part of the price to the bride. C.—The unbelieving Jews, who refrain from idols, receive some temporal advantages; but not thirty pieces of silver, or three cores of wheat, denoting the faith of the blessed Trinity and the observance of the decalogue, whereby they might obtain eternal life. Towards the end of the world they shall be converted. W.  
**3** *Man’s.* After the person was espoused, any infidelity was punished as if she had been married. It does not appear that Osee took this woman to wife. C.—But he signified that the people must wait for God, in captivity. Theod. Sanct. lv.  
**4** *Altar.* Heb. “statue;” *matseba* instead of *mozbe*, as ( H.) others agree with S. Jerom, and there seems to have been no variation in his time.—*Theraphim* *.* Images or representations, ( Ch.) either good or bad. As the other things mentioned were good, such lawful images as were used in the temple must be meant. 3 K. 7:36. W.—S. Jerom explains it of cherubim. Sept. “altar, priesthood, and manifestations (Urim, &c.) being wanting.” H.—Yet some take it in a bad sense. The Jews adhere neither to God nor to idols. Vat. &c.—What misfortune, however, would the latter be? In exile the Jews were deprived of the exercise of their religion, and of their princes. C.—But this was only a figure of what they endured since they rejected Christ. Orig. Philoc. i. S. Jer.—This wretched state will probably continue till they at last embrace the yoke of Christ, the true king of ages. C.  
**5** *David, their king.* That is, Christ, who is of the house of David. Ch.—After the captivity, the Jews submitted to Zorobabel. Yet this only foreshewed a more sincere conversion to Jesus Christ. In fact, the house of David never regained the throne, ( C.) and it is not clear that Zorobabel had any authority over the people. H.—Christ is the literal object of this prediction. C.

## Chapter 4

**1** *Israel.* They are chiefly addressed, (Chal. S. Jer. C.) or what follows to v. 15, regards all. W.—*Judgment.* Heb. “a trial.”—*Mercy.* The want of humanity and of practical knowledge is urged. C.—The knowledge of God includes the observance of the commandments. 1 Jo. 2:4. W.—This science alone is requisite. Jer. 9:3. Is. 5:13. Blind leaders prove their own and other’s ruin.  
**2** *Blood* *.* The successors of Jeroboam II. were mostly murdered. C.—Incestuous marriages take place. H.  
**3** *Together.* The waters shall be dried up, or infected. C.—When the people are taken away, beasts will not long remain. Jer. 9:10. Soph. 1:2. H.  
**4** *Judge*, &c. As if he would say: It is in vain to strive with them, or reprove them, they are so obstinate in evil. Ch.—*Priest.* Such must be slain. Deut. 17:12. C.—Sept. “my people are like a priest contradicted,” ( H.) or degraded. Theod.  
**5** *Prophet*, both true and false.—*Night* of tribulation. Heb. and Sept. “I have compared thy mother to the night.”  
**6** *Silent.* Sept. “like those who had,” &c.—*Knowledge.* Jeroboam I. had appointed unlawful priests, and some of the house of Aaron went over to him, and were excluded from officiating at Jerusalem, after the captivity. 2 K. 12:31. Ezec. 44:10. Knowledge is always expected of priests. Deut. 17:8. Mal. 2:7. Gratian. dist. 38. c. *omnes* *.* C.—When the power of sacrificing is withdrawn, all spiritual functions cease, as sacrifice belongs properly to a priest. W.  
**7** *Me.* A father rejoices in a numerous offspring. But my people take occasion to offend me the more they increase. C.  
**8** *Sins:* victims. W.—*Iniquity;* or “they seek for support in their propitiatory offerings,” and lull the people asleep in their sins. The priests of the golden calf imitated the sacred rites of Moses. It would have been too difficult to make the people change altogether.  
**9** *Priest.* They are equally dissolute, and shall meet the like punishment.—*Devices*, or thoughts. C.—*Cogitatio mali operis pæna* *s luet* *.* S. Jer.  
**10** *Ceased.* Heb. “increased.” They have no children living. C.—Sept. “let them not succeed.”  
**11** *Understanding.* Lit. “heart.” H.—Some sins darken reason more than others; but none so much as spiritual fornication. W.  
**12** *Staff.* It was customary to use this mode of divination, (Ezec. 21:21) and likewise incense. v. 13.—*Oak.* These terms are variously rendered as the trees and stones mentioned in Scripture, will probably never be ascertained.  
**14** *Visit.* This is the most dreadful of God’s judgments. He permits those who offend him to receive discontent from their own families.—*Effeminate*, like the Galli, &c. (S. Jer.) and votaries of Priapus. 3 K. 15:11. Heb. “the consecrated women.” Sept. “initiated,” to honour a lewd idol by prostitution. C.—*Beaten.* Sept. “adhere to a harlot. But thou, Israel, be not ignorant, and Juda go,” &c. H.  
**15** *Offend.* It was more culpable for Juda to commit idolatry (as they had the temple, &c. of the true God) than for Israel, whom Jeroboam hindered from going to Jerusalem, after he had set up his golden calves. W.—*Galgal* and *Bethaven* *.* Places where idols were worshipped. Bethel, which signifies *the house of God*, is called by the prophet Bethaven, that is the *house of vanity*, from Jeroboam’s golden calf which was worshipped there. Ch.—Galgal was on the confines of the two kingdoms, and always venerated by the Jews. Idols had been there in ancient times, and probably a sort of oracle. Judg. 3:19. If Israel be thus abandoned, let not Juda imitate them. C.—*Lord.* Profane not this sacred name by giving it to idols. Theod.—Use not this expression, since you do not worship me. S. Jer.  
**16** *Wanton.* Sept. “stung,” or rendered furious. Thus Israel gives way to ungovernable passions. The people shall be led into captivity, and have room to range about.  
**17** *Partaker.* Heb. “tied to abominations.”—*Alone.* His case is desperate. C.—Sept. “he has placed stumbling-blocks for himself.” H.  
**18** *Separated* from that allowed to God’s people. Deut. 12:12. Heb. “insipid,” or spoiled. Chal. “their princes have sought after banquets.” Sept. “He has provoked (*surpassed*) the Chanaanites.” These two have not read as we do.—*They.* Heb. “their shields (*chiefs*) have loved shame:” dissolute practices, or “presents,” which are disgraceful. C.—Sept. “They have loved shame by her rage. (19) A whirlwind shall whistle in,” &c. H.  
**19** *Wings.* They shall be quickly removed hence. C.  

---

## Chapter 5

**2** *Depth*, or pits of fire, where victims were sometimes thrown. Iphigen. Grot.—By substituting *th* for *t*, we might read, “they have dug pits to take them.” C. 9:9. Jos. 23:13. C.—Idolatry leads to the abyss. H.  
**4** *Known.* Fornication had darkened their intellect. C.  
**5** *Answer.* Sept. “be humbled.” It appears openly, so as to deserve condemnation. H.  
**6** *Them.* He will receive their victims no longer. Is. 1:11. C.—In vain do they expect to escape by this appearance of sanctity, while they continue in sin. H.  
**7** *Strangers.* That is, aliens from God: and therefore they are threatened with speedy destruction. Ch.—Their offspring is rebellious, and deserves no longer to be called my people. C. 1:9.—*Month.* Every month the Assyrians shall come upon them; (Chal. S. Jer.) or, in the space of one month, they shall perish. C.—Sept. “the mildew shall eat them and their portions.” H.  
**8** **Ver** **.** **8** **.** *Back.* Bethel lay northwest of Benjamin. The two tribes would hear the distress of Israel, that they might beware and avoid the like misconduct. C.—The captivity is here described. W.  
**9** *That* *.* Lit. “faith,” ( H.) that my word shall come to pass.  
**10** *Bound.* This was a capital crime, under Numa, and forbidden. Deut. 19:14. C.—Juda hoped to seize what was abandoned. S. Jer.—They deferred doing penance, and removed the boundaries set by their fathers, (Theod. C.) the virtuous patriarchs, whom they would not imitate.  
**11** *Oppression.* Lit. “calumny.” H. Is. 52:4.—The Assyrians had no just reason for attacking Israel, though their crimes called for punishment ( C.) from God. H.  
**13** *Avenging.* Heb. and Sept. *Jareb*, (S. Jer.) which some explain of the king of Egypt; others understand the Assyrian; (C. 10:6) while most suppose that Ephraim applied to Phul, and Juda *sent to a* protecting *king*, Theglathphalassar. 4 K. 16:7 and 17:4. C.  
**14** *Lioness.* Heb. and Sept. “panther.” H.—The Assyrians, instead of assisting, proved the ruin of both kingdoms.  
**15** *Place;* to heaven. I will abandon my temple. C.—*Face:* “they will seek the absent.” S. Jer.  

---

## Chapter 6

**1** *Early*, or in haste. All the people will repent. C.  
**2** *Cure us.* God is always ready to receive penitents. W.  
**3** *Third.* In a short time the Lord will easily set us free. But the prophet refers more directly to the resurrection of the faithful, and of Christ. Eph. 2:5 and 1 Cor. 15:4. C.—S. Paul mentions the third day according to *the Scriptures*, which nowhere else so clearly specify it. W. See S. Jer. S. Cyp. Sanct. 9.—*Know.* Hitherto we have been reproached with voluntary ignorance in adoring idols. C. 4:6. We will amend.—*His*, Christ’s.—*Rain.* It falls only in autumn and in spring. Deut. 11:14. C.  
**4** *Mercy.* Heb. chesed, ( H.) “piety,” &c. (Grot.) whence the word Assideans is derived. 1 Mac. 2:42. The captives flattered themselves, that as soon as they began to entertain sentiments of repentance, God would relieve them. But he answers that their virtue is inconstant, and that they must suffer in proportion to their crimes.  
**5** *Mouth.* I have ordered my prophets to denounce death unto them, and to treat them roughly, like a piece of marble designed for a statue. Sept. &c. “I have slain thy prophets,” &c. by Elias, Jehu, &c. The former sense is preferable.—*Thy judgments*, or condemnation. C.—Heb. “and thy judgments light shall go forth.” H.—Pocock labours hard, but in vain, to explain this; as all the old versions, except the Vulg. have, “my judgments as the light,” &c. Heb. letters may probably have been ill joined, (Kennicott) as Meibomius suspects they have been also. Jer. 23:33. Here *umospoti caur*, “my judgments as the light,” &c. is exchanged for umishpatec or*.* This would be very easy when words were written undivided, as in ancient MSS. H.—“Some transcriber upon hearing umishpatecaor, from the person dictating to him, writ umishpateca or instead of umishpate caor*.* Kennicott, Diss. 1.  
**6** *Mercy:* sincere piety. v. 4.—*Sacrifice.* They had offered many. C. 5:6. C.—“My victims are the salvation of the faithful, and the conversion of sinners.” S. Jer.—*Knowledge*, of a practical nature, which was deficient. C. 4:6 and 6:4. C.  
**7** *Adam.* A compact was made with him, that if he continued faithful or otherwise, his posterity should be born in original justice or sin. H.—He transgressed, and was expelled from paradise, as the Jews were from their land. Sept. “like a man:” like any who had not been so highly favoured with the law, &c. C.—*Adam* means “a man,” and sometimes it would be as well rendered in this sense. H.  
**8** *Supplanted with blood.* That is, undermined and brought to ruin for shedding of blood; and, as it is signified in the following verse, for *conspiring with the priests*, (of Bethel) like *robbers*, to *murder in the way* such as *passed out of Sichem* to go towards the temple of Jerusalem. Or else *supplanted with b* *lood* signifies flowing in such a manner with blood, as to suffer none to walk there without embruing the *soles* of their feet in blood. Ch.—Thus they would become unclean, and might easily slip. H.—Galaad was famous for the treaty between Laban and Jacob; and all such places were chosen for altars in the latter times of the two kingdoms. Maspha or Ramoth were the usual resorts. Theodoret reads, “Galgal.” C. 4:15. C.  
**9** *Robbers.* Jephte had infested those parts, and the country was noted for murders; whence more cities of refuge were appointed in it. Judg. 11 and Jos. 20:8. The prophet alludes to what had been said to Gad. Gen. 49:19.—*Out of*, or to Sichem. They were jealous of people going thither, ( C.) wishing to receive their offerings themselves. H.  
**11** *Harvest.* This implies punishment or felicity. The turn of Juda shall come, and he shall be chastised; but after the captivity, he shall enjoy plenty. C. 2:15. Is. 9:3. C.  

---

## Chapter 7

**1** *Israel.* God divided the kingdom, that by this chastisement the people might be converted. But Jeroboam set up calves, and caused them to grow worse. W.—How often did God send his prophets to reclaim them!—*Without.* Most of the kings were of this stamp, while foreign nations invaded the land.  
**2** *Face.* I do not search ( C.) into their past lives; they sin publicly, and without ceasing. I have been too indulgent. H.  
**3** *Glad*, &c. To please Jeroboam and their other kings, they have given themselves up to the worship of idols, which are mere falsehood and lies. Ch.—We do not find one good king of Israel. C.—But Jeroboam principally *caused Israel to sin.* H.—His infernal policy changed the religion of his subjects.  
**4** Leaven*.* Jeroboam invited the people simply to a feast, and used no violence to make them adopt his novelties. But they soon prevailed, and brought on ruin. The *cake*, or whole nation, was burnt, (v. 8) as well as the princes. v. 7. C.  
**5** *Princes.* The chief men joined in the schism and idolatry. W.—*Mad*, with drinking at the king’s coronation, or at his coming to the crown. C.—Bacchus presents three cups to the wise; the fourth is the cup of petulance, the fifth of shouts, the sixth of debauchery, &c. Athen. Dipsc. ii. 1. Eccli. 31:38.—*Scorners.* Sept. “pestilent people,” who turn religion and piety to ridicule. Instead of repressing them, the king admits them to favour.  
**6** *Them.* Jeroboam seduces the subjects of the house of David, by indulging the passions of the great and small. He may then sleep; the poison gains ground. C.—But soon his own family will feel the direful effects of his policy. H.  
**7** *Judges*, or rulers. Idolatry proved fatal to all. v. 3.  
**8** *Mixed*, like oil and flour. Heb.—*Ashes.* Thin cakes ( C.) of this kind are used by the poor, in Spain, (Sanct.) and by the Arabs. Thevenot. Levant. xxxii.—*Turned.* There was no time allowed by the enemy, who came and took the Israelites away. C.—They became like other nations, and would not repent. W.  
**9** *Strangers:* kings of Assyria, Damascus, &c.—*Hairs.* He is grown old in misery, and yet is insensible of it, and sees not that he will shortly cease to be a *peo* *ple.* Is. 7:8.  
**10** *Humbled.* Heb. “answer.” C. 5:5. Pride is visible on his face, though he be so much reduced. C.—For all these sins Israel shall be severely punished. W.  
**11** *Decoyed.* Heb. “stupid.” C. 4:11. The dove is the only bird which is not grieved at the loss of its young. S. Jer.—It returns to the same nest, though repeatedly robbed, forgetting past dangers. Theod.—Thus Israel is not reclaimed, though idolatry has so often proved its ruin.—*Egypt.* Jeroboam had returned thither, and at his return brought about a division of the kingdom. 3 K. 11:40. Osee, the last king, applied to Sua, and this provoked the *Assyrians* to destroy the kingdom. They pretended that it was tributary to them, after Phul had been invited to assist Manahem for a thousand talents. 4 K. 15:19 and 17:4. Thus was a worldly policy confounded.  
**12** *Heard* the menaces of Moses, (Deut. 27) and of the prophets. 4 K. 17:13. C.—Sept. “I will instruct (or chastise) them by the hearing of their misery,” ( H.) when it shall become the subject of conversation throughout the world.  
**13** *Lies*, attributing their deliverance to the golden calf, (3 K. 12:28. C. Ex. 32:8. M.) and always denying my justice and power.  
**14** *Thought:* “ruminated.” H.—Heb. “assembled, *or* been afraid.” Sept. “they were cut,” ( C.) in honour of idols, hoping to avert the famine. S. Cyr.  
**15** *Arms.* I gave them my laws and power to resist the enemy. M.  
**16** *Returned*, imitating Apis, the folly of Egypt. They have repeatedly followed idols in Egypt, and in the desert, under Jeroboam, Achab, Jehu, &c.—*Deceitful.* Sept. “bent.” Theodoret reads, “unbent.” It never hits the mark, ( C.) but wounds the person who uses it. S. Jer.—*Derision.* The Egyptians laugh at them; ( C.) or thus they acted heretofore, in Egypt. Chal.

## Chapter 8

**1** *Eagle.* It makes a noise like a trumpet. Pliny x. 3.—Osee denounces judgments on the house of Israel, which, though schismatical, was not entirely abandoned by the Lord. Salmanasar overturned the kingdom, and may be compared to an eagle, as Nabuchodonosor is frequently, Ezechiel 17:3. But he is not here meant. C.—The temple shall be destroyed by him; (S. Jer.) yet not so soon. W.—Sept. “In their bosom like earth *appears*, like an eagle,” &c. H.  
**2** *Know thee.* They resemble those to whom our Saviour will reply, *Not every one that saith, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom* *of heaven.* Mat. 7:22. C.  
**3** *Him.* Sept. “they have pursued the enemy.” But the former sense is better. H.—The Assyrians prevailed. S. Jer.—They carried Israel into captivity, before Juda. v. 9.  
**4** *They.* Jeroboam and Jehu were assured by the prophets that they should reign, yet this was not a sanction of their right. God condemned their ambition and wicked conduct. The successors of Zarharias had still less pretensions to the throne. God permits such things. The people had not consulted him in these changes. C.—Kings were their own choice. 1 K. 18. Saul rose by their “error.” S. Jer.—*Knew*, or approved *not.* v. 2. Mat. 25:12. C.—*Perish.* This was the effect, though contrary to their intention. H.  
**5** *Calf.* The idol is broken in pieces, and carried away by the victorious enemy. Thus does the vanity of such gods appear. Their captivity is therefore often foretold. Jer. 43:12.—*Cleansed.* The physician is disgusted with the obstinacy of the sick. C.—How long will Israel *resist t* *he Holy Ghost?* Acts 7:51. H.  
**6** *Israel.* This enhances the crime. Can a people so highly favoured adore the work of an artist?—*Webs*, such as appear on a fine day in autumn. S. Jerom’s master suggested that this was the sense. Interpreters vary. C.—Sept. and Th. “is delusive.” Sym. &c. “instable;” shebabim. H.—Some erroneously read *v* instead of *i.* “The Lord casts off the calves of heretics, … and wonders that people should prefer heretical filth before the cleanliness of the Church.” S. Jer.  
**7** *Whirlwind.* They shall be punished for their folly, nor shall they reap any advantage from idols.—*In it*, or in Israel. The seed which I have sown yields no fruit. If any come up, the mildew destroys it. Yea, though any should come to perfection, which is impossible, it should be given to strangers. My people perform no acts of religion; or at least they render them useless, by adoring idols. C.—He speaks in general terms, as few continued faithful. Yet even in the worst of times, seven thousand were found. 3 K. 19:18. H.  
**8** *Vessel.* The nations around despised them, after they had applied to the Assyrians, who were looked upon as enemies of all independent states. Israel was not yet in captivity: but this event may be spoken of as if already past.  
**9** *Wild ass.* It is very jealous of liberty, (Job 11:12) and of its females, so that it prevents the young males from becoming its rivals. Pliny viii. 30. Solin xxx.—If this were true, the species would soon perish. H.—The Israelites disdained subjection to strangers. They even rejected God, their king; for which reason he abandons them to servitude, in a foreign land. They had run furiously after idols, and had given presents to such *lovers.*  
**10** *Princes.* Heb. “king of kings.” This proud title was afterwards taken by the monarchs of Babylon and Persia. Israel ceased to pay taxes, having nothing left. They shall cease to be a people. C.—Sept. “I will receive them, and they shall cease a little to anoint a king and princes.” H.—They had none during the captivity, as they would not consult God before in their appointment. v. 4. He speaks ironically. I will conduct them beyond the Euphrates, where they shall have nothing to pay for some time. C.—This wretched condition was of long continuance; (Tournemine) though short, if compared with their crimes. H.  
**12** *Foreign.* Shall I give them laws again to despise? Sept. “I shall write down their number.” It will be an easy task, they shall be so diminished. “His laws,” &c. ( C.) or, “I will describe to him a multitude, and his regulations: The beloved altars have been deemed foreign. S. Jerom’s and Grabe’s edit. H.  
**13** *Egypt*, to escape the Assyrian. C. 9:3. C.—They have imitated the Egyptian idols. S. Jer.—Osee had applied to their king for aid. 4 K. 17:4.  
**14** *Temples*, or “palaces.” C.—*Cities.* The two tribes, witnessing the calamities of their brethren, will not avoid a similar conduct, but trust in their fortifications. W.—*Fire* of war destroys both kingdoms.—*Thereof.* Sept. of S. Jerom adds, “and among the Assyrians they have eaten unclean things,” which may be taken from C. 9:3. H.—It is not found in the present Heb. or Gr. copies. C.

## Chapter 9

**1** *Reward*, or “present.” The kings took the tithe. 1 K. 8:15. Other infidel nations rejoice in their wealth. Israel ought not to do so; and, in punishment of idolatry, it shall be despoiled. After Jeroboam II. all went to ruin.  
**2** *Deceive.* The grapes shall yield no wine. C.—*Spem mentita seges* *.* Hor. ii. ep. 2. and 3. ode 1. and 16.)  
**3** *Egypt*, through distress. C. 8:13. S. Jer. v. 6. W.—Sua afforded no protection, and the country proved a grave to those who retired thither.—*Unclean.* The people observed these prescriptions, though they neglected the more important duties. Only some pious souls, like Tobias, Daniel, &c. refrained from such meats in exile. C.—Ezechiel (4:9) foreshewed this by his bread. S. Jer.  
**4** *Wine.* They shall be at a distance from the temple, and in a country where the wine will not be deemed pure. The Jews will drink none which they have not made; and they usually lift up the cup, and pour out a little in God’s honour. This they could not do in Assyria, ( C.) not having liberty to do all about the wine.—*Sacrifices.* The Israelites had long neglected to offer any in the temple, ( H.) though they had no hindrance. In exile, the fruits, &c. were all accounted unclean, like meats used in mourning, ( C.) which defiled those who partook of them. Deut. 26:14. Num. 19:11. “The sacrifices of heretics are the bread of mourning. They offer them not to God, but to the dead, to wicked heresiarchs.” S. Jer.—*Soul.* They have need enough of it. H.—“Let them gratify their appetite; I love not what is unclean.” S. Jer.  
**5** *Lord*, when he shall punish you. Is. 34:6. H.—Israel did not go to the temple, but they kept the festivals and banquets in their own manner, the privation of which they would feel.  
**6** *Gather* into the grave. Yet some shall escape. C. 11:11.—*Silver*, which they buried at the approach of the enemy, hoping to recover it when they should depart. The Arabs do so still, ( C.) and the Indians likewise, that they may have something to support them in the next world! Bernier.—*Bur.* Heb. “thorns.” C.  
**7** *Mad.* Israel shall promise itself all prosperity, not being inspired by God, but full of madness. W.—There were many false prophets. The true ones were often accounted idols. 4 K. 9:11. Ezec. 3:25. C.—“What is said respecting Israel, in this prophet, must be understood of heretics, who being truly mad, utter falsehoods against God. S. Jer.—Sept. “and Israel shall be hurt like the prophet beside himself, the man having (*or* hurried away by) the spirit.” H.  
**8** *My God.* I am such; but the false prophets strive to seduce you. C.—Jeroboam ought to have restrained the people, and he did the reverse, setting up a calf at Bethel, which proved more ruinous than the crime of Gabaa, (Jud. 19) or the election of Saul. “In ancient records, I cannot find that any have divided the Church but those who were appointed by God, priests and prophets, that is watchmen.” S. Jer.—Indeed, almost all heresies owe their rise to the pride or lust of some who have been in high stations.—*Madness.* Heb. “*and* hatred in (marg. against) the,” &c. Prot. H.—Instead of standing up for the people, he provokes God.  
**9** *Sin.* As they have imitated the citizens of Gabaa, they may expect a similar fate. C.  
**10** *Top.* These are the best. H.—The patriarchs were pleasing to God. He chose the Hebrews; but they began to worship Beelphegor or Adonis, even before the death of Moses. This worship was most shameful. What will not passion do when the gods shew the example!  
**11** *Conception.* Their children, in whom they glory, shall be destroyed ( C.) in the very embryo. H.  
**12** *When.* Sept. Th. “my flesh is taken from them,” which Theodoret, Lyran, &c. explain of the incarnation; but Aquila, &c. agree with the Vulg. which is more natural. C.  
**13** *Tyre.* The kingdom of Israel was no less proud. Ezec. 26. W.—It was in the highest prosperity under Jeroboam II. Osee saw this and the subsequent overthrow. Tyre was a most populous and wealthy city. C.—Other interpreters have, “a rock;” Sept. “a prey.” The latter read *d* for *r.* S. Jer. H.—The Vulg. seems best. C.—Tsor denotes, “Tyre and a rock.” H.  
**14** *Children*, as they have exposed them to the fury of the Assyrians, ( C.) or to their idols. Drus.—The prophet appears to demand vengeance through zeal; but it is only a prediction. C.  
**15** Galgal: “heaped together.” H.—When they erected profane altars here, I could spare them no longer. C.—*No more*, so as to suffer them to pass unpunished. H.—He afterwards restored them to favour. C. 1:10 and 2:14. C.—At Galgal they rejected the Lord’s spiritual and temporal dominion. M.  
**16** *Dried up.* They are compared to a vine. C. 10:1. C.  

---

## Chapter 10

**1** *Branches.* Sept. “Wood.” Sym. This is all: it yields no fruit. Prot. “empty.” H.—Heb. “plucked.” The grapes are taken away, as the Israelites were; though they boasted of their numbers. C. 9:16. They are often compared to a vine, the symbol of fecundity. Is. 5:3. Ps. 127:3. C.—The greater benefits of God enhanced their ingratitude. W.—On every noted hill ( H.) profane altars were erected.  
**2** *Divided* between the Lord and idols. 3 K. 18:21. C.—The Jews relate that Osee, the last king of Israel, gave the people leave to go to Jerusalem; (4 K. 17:2) and as they would not take advantage of it, their ruin was decreed. S. Jer.  
**3** *No king*, in captivity; or they give this title to the golden calf. Manahem had destroyed one, so that they could not but see its vanity. The neighbouring nations looked upon their idols as their kings.  
**4** *Covenant* with Phul, who seeks only your destruction. 4 K. 15:19. C.—*Bitterness.* Heb. “poison,” ( H.) or a bitter herb. C.  
**5** *The ki* *ne of Bethaven.* The golden calves of Jeroboam, ( Ch.) one of which ( H.) was set up at Bethel. W.—The feminine *cows*, is spoken in ridicule; as ( C.) *O verè Phrygiæ*, Æn. ix. Isis was represented with a cow’s head. Herod. ii. 41.—*Rejoiced.* To avoid this apparent contradiction, the Jews relate that the priests had sent a brazen calf to the Assyrians, and secreted the golden one. While they rejoiced at their success, Salmanasar, (Seder. Olam.) or Sennacherib, discovered the cheat, and came to destroy the kingdom. S. Jer.—This has the air of a fable. If ( C.) we substitute *e* for *g*, in yagilu, ( H.) we may give a good sense to the Heb. “The people shouting, *or* in black, (cemaraiv) have been in sorrow, because their glory is taken from them: so the idol is called. Ps. 105:20. C.  
**6** *Itself also is* *carried*, &c. One of the golden calves was given by king Manahem to Phul, king of the Assyrians, to engage him to stand by him. Ch.—*Avenging.* C. 5:13.—*Will*, or expectation of aid. C.—He had recourse to this nation, without consulting God. H.  
**7** *Pass.* Heb. “As for Samaria, it is undone. Its king is like froth, *or* a bubble,” &c. C. 11:1. The *calf;* (v. 3.) Zacharias or Osee may be meant.  
**8** *Us*, as the Jews would do at the last siege, and sinners before the day of judgment. Lu. 23:30. Apoc. 6:14. Too happy, if they could by a speedy death escape eternal torments! C.—People shall be in the utmost consternation at the approach of the Assyrians. H.—They will not think themselves secure enough in their caverns.  
**9** *Gabaa* *.* Sept. “high places;” or he alludes to the brutality of the citizens. Judg. 20:13.—*Stood.* Those of Gabaa were speedily punished by the other tribes. Now, all are perverse. At that time one tribe was guilty, and yet some were spared; but all Israel shall be now led into captivity. C.—From the time that Dan adored Micha’s idol, (Jud. 18:14) the evil has spread among the rest of the tribes, which did not punish this transgression. Hence all shall at last suffer. W.  
**10** *Their two iniquities.* Their two calves; ( Ch.) or because they have abandoned God, and followed idols. Jer. 2:13. Many render, “when I shall have tied them, *like oxen*, in their two furrows.” But the Vulg. is plainer, and adopted by most.  
**11** *Neck.* I will confine her to harder labour. While the oxen tred out corn, they may eat. Deut. 25:4.—*Himself.* Juda shall be chastised after the ten tribes; so that none of my people shall escape.  
**12** *Mouth.* Heb. “in proportion to ( C.) *your* piety.” Sept. “gather a vintage of the fruit of life.” H.—*Ground.* Reform you conduct. C.—*Justice*, when Christ shall appear, the source of all our grace and justice. S. Jer. &c. C.—Sept. “Light up for yourselves the light of knowledge, for it is time; seek the Lord, till ye obtain the fruit of justice.”  
**13** *Ploughed.* Sept. “Why have you concealed impiety,” refusing to confess? H.—*Iniquity*, or punishment.—*Lying.* Your hopes are frustrated, and no fruit is seen. C.—*Ways:* idols. S. Jer.  
**14** **4** **.** *Tumult.* Heb. shaon; the din of war, ( H.) or cry of soldiers. C.—*Salmana*, king of the Madianites, *was destroyed by the house;* that is, by the followers *of him that judgeth Baal;* that is, of Gedeon, who threw down the altar of Baal, and was therefore called Jerobaal. See Judg. 6 and 8. Ch.—*Of him.* Sept. Rom. “of Jeroboam.” But S. Jer. &c. have, *Jerobaal* *.* Theodoret, “in the house of Arbeel.” Heb. “as Salmana ruined the house of Arbela.” There were many places of this name; but none of great note, taken by Salmanasar. Some think that he took it before he was king. Yet this is all uncertain, and the Heb. seems rather changed, so that we should read with the Alex. MS. S. Jer. &c. *Jerobaal*, who defeated the Madianites, and treated Succoth with great severity. Judg. 8:15. C.  
**15** *Bethel.* This place, defiled by an idol, shall be the scene of your misery. Sept. “So I will treat you, O house of Israel,” &c. ( H.) which is not in Heb. (S. Jer.) but seems as good. H.—Heb. adds here properly, ( C.) “Presently, *or* in the morning, shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off,” which we have in the next chapter.

## Chapter 11

**1** *Away.* The last kings of Israel lived in the midst of troubles. H.—Osee, though one of the best, brought ruin on the nation. C.—*Son:* Israel. But as the calling of Israel out of Egypt was a figure of the calling of Christ from thence; therefore this text is also applicable to Christ, as we learn from S. Mat. 2:15. Ch. Julian pretends that the apostle has abused this text. But it speaks of both events. S. Jer.—Eusebius (Dem. ix. 3.) thinks that S. Mat. refers to Balaam; (Num. 24:8) and S. Jerom does not reject this opinion, (in Mat. 2. C.) to avoid “wrangling,” though he repeatedly alleges this text as a proof his version being more accurate than that of the Sept. which has *his children.* This reading the best editions retain; so that it may seem a matter of surprise, that Fabricius should give this verse as a specimen of Origen’s Hexapla, and still print *my son*, taking it, as he says, from the Barbarini copy, the London Polyglot, and Cave. Bib. Gr. iii. 12. The first column has the Heb. text, and the second the same in Greek characters, &c. The reader may form a judgment of this work from the following specimen: 1. Heb. (which we shall express) karathi bani. 2. Gr. καραθι βανι. 3. Aq. εκαλεσα τον υιον μου. 4. Sym. κεκληται υιος μου. 5. Sept. κεκληται υιος μου. 6. Th. και εκαλεσα υιον μου. If any other versions were added, to form Octapla, &c. they were placed after Theodotion, who, though prior to Symmachus, is placed after him, because his version was not so unlike that of the Sept. and the deficiencies were chiefly supplied from him. In the Rom. and Alex. edit. instead of the above we find, μετεκαλεσα τα τεκνα αυτου. “I have recalled his children.” H.—This is literally spoken of Israel, (styled God’s son, Ex. 4:23) and mystically, ( W.) though no less ( H.) truly, of Jesus Christ, as the inspired evangelist shews. W.  
**2** *They called:* viz. Moses and Aaron called: but they went away after other gods, and would not hear. Ch.—Sept. “As I called them back, or (repeatedly; μετεκαλησα. Grabe has, “he called;” meaning any of God’s ministers) so they rushed away from my presence.” H.—This sense appears preferable to the Heb. C.  
**3** *Healed them.* My laws were designed to counteract idolatry. H.—I treated them with the utmost tenderness. Deut. 1:31 and 32:11.  
**4** *Adam.* I placed my people in a sort of paradise, ( C.) like the first man; and as they have imitated him, they shall suffer accordingly. Rufin. Haimo.—But Sept. &c. render, “of a man.” They shall be treated like the rest. C.—Grace draws man by sweet means. His free-will is not destroyed, nor is he impelled, like beasts, by force or fear, ( W.) though the latter is often used for the most salutary purposes.—*Yoke*, or muzzle, which prevents them from eating. H.—I furnish them with manna. Can it be suspected that I wish to oppress them? C.  
**5** *Egypt.* Many went, contrary to this prohibition. H.—Yet they did not prosper, as they expected. The Hebrews had also often murmured in the desert, and threatened to return to Egypt.  
**6** *Heads.* Heb. “counsellors.” Civil war desolated the kingdom, and made way for the Assyrians. Sept. “they are devoured on account of their projects.” C.—They are at a loss what to do.  
**7** *Off*, for a long time; and indeed Israel never recovered its former state, after the captivity. H.—Then they became more docile. Heb. is very ambiguous. C.  
**8** **Ve** **r.** **8** **.** *Adama*, &c. *Adama* and *Seboim* were two cities in the neighbourhood of Sodom, and underwent the like destruction. Ch.—God punishes, like a father, with regret.  
**9** *Not man.* I am not actuated by the spirit of revenge, nor do I fear lest my enemy escape. C.—I punish in order to reclaim, (S. Jer.) and reserve eternal vengeance only for those who die impenitent.—*Holy one.* If there be a just man in Israel, I will spare the nation; (Gen. 18:32) or there are some just, like Tobias, and therefore a part shall be reserved; or, ( C.) I am the just ( H.) God. S. Jer.  
**10** *Lion.* His power is most terrible, and his commands must be obeyed. C.—All nations shall permit the return of Israel. H.—They shall come from *the sea*, of from its islands.  
**11** *Egypt.* Some returned soon; others not before the reign of Alexander, or perhaps later. C. Diss.  
**12** *Denials;* refusing to adhere to my worship. H.—They wished to unite it with that of idols. 3 K. 18. C.—*Saints.* The priests and temple are preserved in Juda. Ezechias brought the people to serve God faithfully, while Israel was led captive. Sept. “the house of Israel and Juda with impiety. Now God hath known them *lovingly*, and it shall be called the holy people of God.” Thus both kingdoms were criminal, and God exercised his mercy towards both. H.—The Jews relate that when their ancestors were pursued by the Egyptians, and the people were desponding, Juda signalized his courage by entering the bed of the sea. S. Jer.—These traditions are suspicious. C.

## Chapter 12

**1** *On.* Lit. the wind. H.—To trust in men is no less vain. W.—Sept. “Ephraim is an evil spirit,” &c.—*Heat.* Heb. “eastern *or* burning wind.” H.—Manahem attempted to engage Egypt on his side, but he was frustrated in his hopes, (4 K. 15. S. Jer.) as Osee was likewise; to which king the sense conducts us better. C. 13:15.—*Oil.* That of Palestine was very excellent. Ezec. 27:17.  
**2** *Judg* *ment.* Heb. “trial.” What follows refers to all the people, whose impiety is contrasted with Jacob’s virtue.  
**3** *Brother* Esau, thus foreshewing what would happen. Gen. 25.—*Angel.* Sept. “God,” whose place this angel held. Elohim implies both. v. 4. Gen. 32:24.  
**4** *Wept.* Sept. “they wept, and besought me.” Other interpreters agree with the Vulg.—*Us.* By changing a vowel point, in Hebrew, it might be, “He spoke to him.” Cap. Grot.—The most magnificent promises were made, at Bethel, regarding the Israelites: this made the profanation of the place more horrible. C.—Sept. “They found me in the house of On, and there the word was addressed to them.”—*Bethaven* was the name of Bethel, among the pious Jews, in the days of Osee. H.  
**5** *Memorial*, and the object of worship; or this great Jehovah spoke to Jacob.  
**7** Chanaan. The Phœnicians were so called, and all merchants. Here the title is given reproachfully ( C.) to all the posterity of Jacob. H.—None more ignominious could be used. Dan. 13:56. Thus Rome is styled Babylon.  
**8** *Idol.* Heb. also, “vanity.” Riches are vain, and lead to idolatry when people place their affections on them. Mat. 13:22. Eph. 5:5.—*Committed.* I am conscious of no injustice. C.—Yet he had used a deceitful balance, and his judgment is equally perverse. H.—“What rich man shall be saved?” Clem. Alex.  
**9** *Egypt.* At Sinai the covenant between God and Israel was chiefly ratified. The former ceased not to perform the conditions, but the latter repaid him with ingratitude.—*Feast.* The people shall be brought back, ( C.) or they shall again be forced to dwell under tents. Theod.—“Shall I still cause?” &c. Tournemine.  
**10** *Prophets.* They have represented me as it were under visible forms, that you cannot plead ignorance. The prophets prefigured Christ, the end of the law, &c. C.  
**11** *Idol.* That is, if Galaad, with all its idols and sacrifices, be like a mere idol itself, being brought to nothing by Theglathphalassar, how vain is it to expect that the idols worshipped in Galgal shall be of any service to the tribes that remain. Ch.—Will these idols be more powerful? Sept. copies vary. Rom. ed. has *Galaad*, and Comp. Galgal in both places. But that of S. Jer. and of Theodoret is better.—*Heaps* of stones. They are in ruins, or very numerous: ( C.) yet have not secured the country. H.  
**12** *Jacob.* The history of the patriarch, and of his posterity, serves to place the ingratitude of the people in the clearest light. W.—The prophet had interrupted the account of Jacob, (v. 4) who had signalized his piety in Galaad. Gen. 31:46.  
**13** **Ver** **.** **13** **.** *Prophet.* Josue put the people in possession of the country, and offered sacrifice at Galgal, where the rite of circumcision was performed. This place is now defiled. What perfidy ( H.) and ingratitude. C.  
**14** *Him.* He shall suffer for his crimes. M.—He can blame only himself. C.  

---

## Chapter 13

**1** *Spoke.* When Jeroboam proposed to erect the golden calves, people were seized with horror; yet they consented, and soon after Baal and other idols were worshipped. W.—Ephraim was one of the greatest tribes, and by its example the rest were drawn into idolatry. Achab principally introduced the worship of Baal, which caused God to decree the misery of his people. 3 K. 16:31.  
**2** *C* *alves.* A cutting reproach! Those who could stoop to adore a calf, might be so blind as to sacrifice men! Heb. “sacrifice, ye men who,” &c. Jeroboam issues this edict. C.—Sept. “immolate men; calves are wanting.” H.  
**3** *Away.* C. 6:4.—*Chimney*, or hole, at the side or top of the room. C.—Heb. arubba, ( H.) means also “a locust,” as the Sept. render it, though here it affords no sense.  
**5** *Knew* *:* treated thee with kindness, or tried thee. C.  
**6** *Pastures:* the more they were indulged. H. Deut. 32:15.  
**7** *Lioness.* Sept. “panther.” I will pursue them even in their captivity.  
**8** *Whe* *lps;* with the greatest fury. 2 K. 17:8.—*Inner.* Heb. “what encloses the heart;” or, I will break their hard heart. C.  
**9** *Own.* Evils are brought on by the sins of men, which God does not cause. W.—Sept. “who will aid *to prevent* thy perdition, O Israel.” H.—God alone is the author of salvation. He also punishes, (Amos 3:6) but for man’s amendment in life. W.  
**10** *Princes.* It was on this pretext that a king was demanded. 1 K. 8:20. Will any now save you? M.  
**11** *King;* Saul, Jeroboam, or the Assyrian.—*Away.* Osee, ( C.) so that you shall have no more kings of Israel. H.—Sept. alone have, “I took ( C.) *or* had *him* in,” &c. S. Jer.  
**12** *Hidden.* He thinks to escape. H.—But I keep it like pieces of silver, bound up in my treasury. S. Jer. C.  
**13** *Him.* He shall be taken when he least expects it. His fruit shall come forth. Jer. 4:31.—*Children.* He shall have no share in the division of property, or shall not escape when the father shall bring his children to an account. The Chal. &c. insinuate, that the infant affords no help to come forth, as it would if it had sense. C.  
**14** *Death.* This must be understood of eternal misery, from which the just are preserved. All must die, and many suffered a violent death from the Assyrians. W.—After denouncing the severest judgments, the prophet promises redress and a sort of resurrection, which was a figure of the real sufferings and rising of Jesus Christ. The apostle applies this text to him, but follows not the Heb. or Sept. 1 Cor. 15:55. C.—*Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is* *thy sting?* Prot. read, *O grave*, (marg. *hell*) instead of the latter *death.* Heb. ehi has been twice placed for *aie, I will be* instead of *where?* ( H.) as the Gr. Arab. and Syr. versions, as wll as the context, evince. All the versions prove the same corruption to be. v. 10. Kennicott, Aquila, and the 5. edit. read *where?* Sym. *I will be:* (S. Jer.) so that the change probably took place between A. 130 and 200. Sept. “Where is thy cause gained, (*in a lawsuit*, or thy *justice;* δικη. H.) O death?” &c.—*Eyes.* I can find no consolation, (S. Jer.) because the people cause dissension by their perseverance in evil. Hebrew also, “repentance,” &c. I will utterly destroy *Ephraim;* or rather, “vengeance … because he shall flourish,” &c. If Ephraim would repent, this should not take place; but now, *the Lord wil* *l bring* Salmanasar, *a burning wind.* v. 15. C.  
**15** *Springs* of death; or the sins which Christ, born of a virgin, shall destroy, and liberate the *vessels* of election from hell. S. Jer. H.

## Chapter 14

**1** *Perish, because she hath stirred up her God to bitterness.* It is not a curse or imprecation, but a prophecy of what should come to pass ( Ch). to Israel, in Assyria. Many such expressions occur. Ps. 68:25. &c. S. Jer.—Sometimes they are the efforts of zeal, conformable to divine justice. Ps. 140:6. W.—Heb. “Samaria has sinned, *or* shall perish.” C.—*Bitterness.* Sept. “she hath resisted her God.” H.  
**3** *Words.* In captivity, legal victims cannot be offered. C.—But a contrite heart is always acceptable. Ps. 50.—*Good.* While engaged in sin, ( H.) “we can offer thee nothing good.”—*Ca* *lves:* victims of praise. S. Jer.—Heb. parim. Sept. omit *m*, ( H.) and render *fruit.* They are followed by the Arab. and Syr. as well as by the apostle. Heb. 13:15. C.—We will offer what victims we please. E. Ps. 68:23 and 65:13.  
**4** *Gods.* The Assyrians, instead of protecting, oppress us; while Egypt, famous for *horses*, sits unconcerned. C.—But the source of all our evils are the idols, which we will follow no more.—*In thee:* adheres to the true faith in practice. H.—Israel was like an orphan during the captivity. Lam. 1:1. C.  
**5** *Breaches*, when Israel shall be converted, as some were to Christ, and many will be at the end of the world. W.—Heb. “their return.” Sept. “dwellings.” They shall be purified.—*Freely.* I have been forced to chastise, My heart dilates. C.—Sept. “I will love them manifestly.” Syr. “accept their free offerings.” H.  
**6** *Dew.* Israel has been like a plant dried up. C. 13:15.—*Libanus* *.* The cedars were tall and bulky, being well rooted.  
**7** *Glory.* Sept. “he shall be as fruitful as the olive-tree.”—*Libanus*, or incense. C.—The term has both meanings. H.  
**8** *His.* This may refer to the tree, or to God. The captives shall return, and be happy. But in a more sublime sense it refers to the nations which shall embrace the gospel.—*Libanus*, or fragrant. Such wine was esteemed in which certain odoriferous herbs were infused. Cant. 7:2. C.—Libanus was also famous for generous wines. Siconita 11.  
**9** *Idol?* or God will no more reproach them, as their conversion is sincere.—*Make.* Heb. “be to him like,” &c. C.  
**10** *Wise.* This denotes the obscurity of the prophecy. Theod.—No human wit can explain the prophets: yet the just shall understand as much as shall be necessary. S. Jer. S. Aug. de Civ. Dei. xviii. 28. W.—Only few will make good use of these admonitions, and share in the promises. C.
