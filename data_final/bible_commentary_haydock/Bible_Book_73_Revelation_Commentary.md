# Revelation Commentary

**Though** some in the first ages doubted whether this book was canonical, and who was the author of it, (see Euseb. l. 7, Histor. c. xxv.) yet it is certain much the greater part of the ancient fathers acknowledged both that it was a part of the *canon*, and that it was written by S. John, the apostle and evangelist. See Tillemont, in his ninth note upon S. John, where he cites S. Justin, S. Irenæus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertull. S. Cyp. S. Athan. Eusebius, S. Amb. S. Jerom, S. Aug. &c. It was written in Greek to the churches in Asia, under Domitian, about the year 96 or 97, long after the destruction of Jerusalem, when S. John was banished to the island of Patmos, in the Ægean Sea. It is by some called the prophecy of the New Testament, and the accomplishment of the predictions of all the other prophets, by the first coming of Christ at his incarnation, and by his second coming at the end of the world. As to the time when the chief predictions should come to pass, we have no certainty, as appears by the different opinions, both of the ancient fathers, and late interpreters. Many think that most things set down from the fourth chapter to the end, will not be fulfilled till a little time before the end of the world. Others are of an opinion, that a great part of them, and particularly the fall of the wicked Babylon, happened at the destruction of paganism, by the destruction of heathen Rome, and its persecuting heathen emperors. Of these interpretations, see Alcazar in his long commentary, the learned Bossuet, bishop of Meaux, in his treatise on this book, and P. Alleman, in his notes on the same Apocalypse, tom. xii, who, in his preface, says, that this in a great measure may be now looked upon as the opinion followed by the learned. In fine, others think that S. John’s design was in a mystical way, by metaphors and allegories, to represent the attempts and persecutions of the wicked against the servants of God, the punishments that should in a short time fall upon Babylon, that is, upon all the wicked in general; the eternal happiness and reward which God had reserved for the pious inhabitants of Jerusalem, that is, for his faithful servants, after their short trials and tribulations of this mortal life. In the mean time we meet with many profitable instructions and admonitions, which we may easily enough understand; but we have no certainty, when we apply these predictions to particular events; for as S. Jerom takes notice, the Apocalypse has as many mysteries as words, or rather mysteries in every word. *Apocalypsis Joannis tot habet sacramen* *ta quot verba … parum dixi, in verbis singulis multiplices latent intelligentiæ*. Ep. ad Paulin. t. iv. p. 574. Edit. Benedict. Wi.—In the first, second, and third chapters of this book are contained instructions and admonitions which S. John was commanded to write to the seven bishops of the churches in Asia. And in the following chapters, to the end, are contained prophecies of things that are to come to pass in the Church of Christ, particularly towards the end of the world, in the time of antichrist. It was written in Greek, in the island of Patmos, where S. John was in banishment by order of the cruel emperor Domitian, about sixty-four years after our Lord’s ascension. Ch.—This is the last in order of the sacred writings, and contains, in twenty-two chapters, revelations, as the name imports, extremely obscure it must be acknowledged, yet undoubtedly of the utmost importance to the Christian Church, if we may judge from the dignity of the author, who was the beloved disciple, or the grandeur and majesty of the ideas, which pervade every chapter of the work. Being a *sealed book*, or a hidden mystery, in the beginning of the Church, when nothing of this important prophecy had yet been fulfilled, it is no wonder we are deprived of the usual lights which we have hitherto followed in expounding the Scripture, viz. the works of the fathers. So little was it indeed understood at that time, that by many it was long considered as a *reverie*, and an extravagant composition, though the most learned always looked upon it as an inspired work. One reason, which may have led the faithful to class this among the apocryphal works, was the number of fables and illusions published by the misguided piety of the ignorant. We know at least, that on account of the heresy of Cerinthus, which was filled up with illusion and fanaticism, this book was not circulated among the faithful: a few copies were kept with care in the archives of the Churches, to be perused only by the bishop, or such as he thought not likely to abuse it. With regard to the interpretation of it, it will not be expected that it should be attempted in a work of this kind. We shall therefore only give a short account of the principal commentators, and their plans, that the enlightened reader may consult their works, if he wish to enter deeper into the subject. But it should never be forgotten, that the connection of sublime and prophetical ideas which compose this work, has at all times been a labyrinth, in which the greatest geniuses have lost themselves, and a rock on which most commentators have split, the great Sir Isaac Newton not excepted. Hence Scaliger’s praise of Calvin; Calvinus sapuit, quia non scripsit in Apocalypsim. 1. The fathers living before the accomplishment of the events, have of course given us no interpretation. Those, therefore, who have written on it at all, have explained it in a mere moral sense, and drawn from it useful parables and instructions. None of them have given a regular systematic explanation. It must, however, be observed, as a circumstance of some moment, that many of them, particularly SS. Augustine and Jerom, thought the Apocalypse contained prophecies regarding the *whole time* of the existence of the Church of Christ, till its triumphant state in the new Jerusalem. 2. Among the moderns we have abundant interpreters of the Apocalypse in all the reformed Churches. It has indeed grown into a mania among them, the only difference being their respective degrees of absurdity. This has been to all of them the common quarry, whence they have hewn the stones to cast at their mother Church. For to this day they have continued to disgrace themselves and Christianity, by depicting the Church of Rome as the scarlet w——e of Babylon, popery the beast, and the pope antichrist. We must, however, except Grotius and Hammond, who have given historical interpretations, and some few others. 3. Among Catholic expositors stands eminently conspicuous the learned bishop of Meaux, Bosseut. This light of the Galican Church has improved upon and filled up the outlines which Grotius had only sketched. The first three chapters, according to him, regard only the Churches of Asia, to which they are addressed; the other chapters, to nineteen, have been fulfilled in the persecutions which the Church endured under the pagan emperors. The last three are merely allegorical of the triumphs which the Church finally gained over her persecutors. 4. *Du Pin* has taken a wider range. The last three chapters regard the final judgment, and the establishment of the Church in heaven. And all the chapters between the first three and last three, are mere general descriptions of persecutions, fall of tyrants, heresies, &c. which shall happen in the Church; represented under the various figures which the rich imagination of S. John supplied. This system certainly removes all difficulties at once, by saving the trouble of comparing each figure with corresponding historical facts; but substitutes a vague and indeterminate sense, which we do not expect in prophecy. 5. *Calmet* does not vary a great deal in the outlines with Bossuet; but their applications of the text to the history are in many points widely different. He conceives the intermediate chapters between the first three and last three to have been fulfilled in the general persecution begun by Diocletian, in 303, and the destruction of Rome, in 410, by Alaric. The last three chapters give the triumph of the martyrs at that period, as well as many things, which are to take place at the coming of antichrist, and the dissolution of the world. 6. Conceiving that all the above commentators had too much contracted the time for the accomplishment of the prophecy, by limiting it to the establishment of Christianity, *Monsieur de la Chetardie* established a new system upon the supposition that the Apocalypse includes the whole history of Christ’s Church upon earth. In doing this, he had the authority of S. Austin, and other fathers. Observing, therefore, upon an attentive perusal of this work, that there were seven seals, seven trumpets, seven vials, and that at the opening of each seal a new revelation was made, he ingeniously concluded, that the history of the whole Church was divided into seven periods or ages, and that to each period belonged one seal, one trumpet, and one vial. Six of these periods he conceives to be already accomplished, the seventh yet remains concealed in the womb of futurity. 7. Ingenious as is this system of Chetardie, it was not adopted, since Calmet, who wrote after him, preferred his own, which resembled that of Bossuet. It has, however, been renewed by the late bishop Walmsley, under the name of Signor Pastorini, who has taken up the idea and general outline from Chetardie, but illustrated the same with his own interpretation and application to historical facts. The erudition with which the latter author has clothed this system, and the striking aptness of his comparisons of the words of the prophecy to the events which have passed, have gained a very general approbation, and he is almost exclusively followed in the interpretation of this sealed book. How far he has succeeded in his explanation of the seventh age of the Church, cannot be determined by us, since it is shut up in the dark recess of futurity. Posterity will decide. To him we refer the English reader for any further information on the subject, convinced that his researches will be amply gratified, his education wonderfully improved. For, says the illustrious prelate Bossuet, “notwithstanding the obscurities of this book, we experience in its perusal an impression so sweet, and at the same time so magnificent, of the majesty of God; such sublime ideas present themselves of the mystery of Jesus Christ, such noble images of his victories and his reign, and such terrible effects of his judgment, that the soul is quite moved and penetrated. All the beauties of the Scriptures are collected in this book. Whatever there is melting, lively, and majestic in either the law or the prophets, acquires in this book an additional lustre.” O truly adorable truths contained herein! of which God is the plentitude and eternal source; of which Jesus Christ is the prophet, the teacher and master; truths which have the angels for servants and ministers; the apostles and bishops for witnesses and depositaries; and all faithful souls, v. 3 for children and disciples. Let us prepare our hearts to hear Jesus Christ arisen from the dead, discovering to us the mysteries of his kingdom, and the truths of the gospel of his glory. Let us hear his warning voice, and prepare for his speedy coming by a strict observance of every duty. Happy, thrice happy that Christian whom the death of sin, and the sleep of tepidity shall not render deaf to this voice!

## Chapter 1

**1** **Ver.** **1–3** **.** *The* Apocalypse, or *Revelation.* I rather prefer the word Apocalypse, which the Latin interpreter did not think fit to change.—*Of Jesus Christ.… by his Angel*, sent *to his servant* *John.* So that these things were immediately revealed to S. John by an Angel, who represented and spoke in the person of Christ.—*Which must shortly come;* and as it is again said, (v. 3) *the time is at* *hand.* This cannot be meant of all things in the Apocalypse, where mention is also made of the day of judgment, and of the glory of heaven at the end of the world. It can only mean, that some things were to happen shortly, i.e. what is said of the seven churches. C. 2 and 3. Or the persecutions foretold should begin shortly. Or else these expressions are only to signify, that all time is short, and that from the coming of the Messias, we are not in the last age, or the *last hour.* See 1 Jo. 2:18. Wi.—S. John excites their attention by the most pressing motives, the approach of the events. Whatever explanation be given of this book, it is equally true in all, that the time is at hand, when it will begin to be accomplished. To find our consolation and happiness in this sacred book, according to the promise of the Holy Spirit, we must peruse it with faith and humility, receive the interpretation of the Church with submission and docility, and practise the truths contained with fidelity and promptitude. What is the life of man, since ages are but moments that escape us? Eternity is but a moment, but a moment that will never end.  
**4** **Ver.** **4–6** **.** *John to the seven churches*, [1] afterwards named; and by them, to be understood of all churches, bishops, and people in the like dispositions.—*From him, who is, who was, and who is to come.* As these words are only applied, and applicable to him, who is truly God and eternal, Alcazar (p. 176) applies them to God the Father. Others think them to be spoken of God, as the word God agrees to all the three divine persons, who are one and the same God. See Ribera.—*And from the seven spirits.* Alcazar understands them of seven of God’s attributes, or perfections, but, by the common exposition, are meant seven of the chief created spirits, who in a special manner assist at the throne of God, employed to execute God’s commands, as Raphael saith, (Tob. 12:15) *I am one of the seven who stand before God.* Wi.—*Spirits*, &c. Some understand this of the Holy Ghost, on account of his seven gifts; but the most literal interpretation is of the principal Angels, who always surround the throne of God, and are his ministering spirits. Calmet.—*And from Jesus C* *hrist*, [2] made man, and the Redeemer of mankind, whom S. John here names after the seven spirits, because he continues his discourse about Christ, *who is the faithful witness;* testified and approved of God by so many miracles, prophecies, &c. He is the chief of the martyrs or witnesses, as the Greek word signifies.—*The first begotten of the dead*, both first in dignity, and first that rose to an immortal life.—*The prince of the kings of the earth*, whose power is infinitely greater than all theirs; and this to put the suffering Christians in mind, that they needed not to fear the persecuting emperors, who have no power after this life.—*And* Christ *hath made us a kingdom*, inasmuch as by his grace he has made us members of his true Church, called the kingdom of God, and promised us to reign with him in his glorious kingdom in heaven.—*And* hath made us *priests to God, and his Father*, to offer up spiritual sacrifices. See 1 Pet. 2:9.—*To him be*, or is due, *glory and empire, for ever and ever. A* *men*. That is, to Jesus Christ. Wi.  
**7** *Behold he cometh*, or is to come at the day of judgment. Wi.  
**8** *I am Alpha, and Omega.* These, the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, signify the same as what follows, *the beginning, and the end*, the first cause and last end of all intelligent beings, *who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.* These words agree only to him, who is the true God, and here are applied to our blessed Redeemer, who is to come and judge all. Wi.  
**10** *On the Lord’s day.* [3] Not on the Jewish sabbath, which is our Saturday, but on the Christian sabbath, our Sunday, called the *Lord’s day*. The Church, in the apostle’s time, changed the day of rest, on which the Jews were commanded to rest and sanctify that day, from Saturday to Sunday, from the last day of the week to the first. They judged this only to be an indispensable precept, that some day or some time should be appointed, in a special manner, for God’s service and worship, on which Christians should also abstain from servile works, that were not of necessity: as to the determination of such a day of the week, they judged that the Church had power to change the day. The late pretended reformers have all agreed with us in this change. And if they would have all that is expressed in this commandment, to be of an indispensable and unchangeable obligation, according to the letter of the law, they ought certainly to observe, to sanctify, and to abstain from all servile works on Saturdays, or on the Jewish sabbath.—*A great voice, as of a trumpet.* To signify the importance of things to be revealed. Wi.—*Voice*, &c. This was most likely S. John the Baptist, who calls himself the voice of one crying in the desert, and who in Malachy is called the Angel of the Lord, as he is also styled in the first verse of this chapter. Pastorini.  
**12** *I saw seven golden candlesticks*, which, by the last verse of this chapter, represented the seven Churches of Asia. We may suppose these candlesticks to have been shewn to S. John, like what is described, Exod. 25:31. For in these visions of S. John are frequent allusions to the former tabernacle, and to things relating to the service and worship of God, which Moses was ordered to make. Wi.  
**13** *And in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks*, i.e. *walking* among the candlesticks, like unto Christ, as he many times called himself the Son of man, and at other times told the Jews he was the Son, the only begotten Son of God. By this walking among the candlesticks is signified his providential care over all the particular Churches, which make up one Catholic Church.—*With a long garment*, [4] and a *golden girdle*, with a resemblance of the habit of the priests. Wi.—Jesus Christ is in the midst of his Church to enlighten it, to defend and sanctify it, the true model of pastors, who should reside in the midst of their flock, be clothed with sanctity and justice, and girt with the golden girdle, i.e. with singular purity, always ready for combat and labour, by their charity and zeal.  
**15** *His feet like unto fine brass*, to signify the purity and steadfastness of his steps and actions.—*His voice as the sound of many wate* *rs*, the sound of his preaching by himself, and by his apostles, has been heard throughout all nations of the world. Wi.  
**16** *In his right hand seven stars*, which, as it is said, (v. 20) were the *A* *ngels*, i.e. the bishops of the seven churches, by this comparison is expressed their dignity.—*And from his mouth came out a sharp two-edged sword.* The word of God preached is compared to a two-edged sword. Ephes. 6:17 and Heb. 4:12. It also signifies God’s severity in punishing sinners. Wi.  
**17** *I am the first and the last*. These are the words of the Son of man, or of him that represented our Saviour, Christ, to S. John. To be the first and the last, is another expression agreeing only to him who is the true God, as it is divers times applied by the prophet Isaias. Wi.—From the 12th verse to this place we have a description of the Son of man, i.e. Christ. The different emblematical descriptions of his countenance, his dress, &c. are similar to what are used by other prophets, and easily explained of his attributes, his eternity, vengeance, &c. &c. Omnes passim.  
**18** *And alive, and was dead;* always living as God, and as man was dead, died on the cross for the salvation of all men, rose again, triumphed over hell, death, and sin, and am living for ever and ever, and have the keys of death and of hell, power over all, all things being made subject to me, even as man, or as God and man. Wi.  
**20** *Angels.* These are the seven bishops of the churches. Christ’s having them in his right hand, shews the care he takes of his Church. Calmet.

## Chapter 2

**1** **Ver.** **1–7**. *To the Angel of the church of Ephesus.* The great S. Timothy, who was bishop of Ephesus, died a glorious martyr about this time. But as for the admonitions and reprehensions given in these letters, we must take notice, that they are given to the faithful of each church, and not only to the bishops, as it appears by the words so often repeated. Wi.—*Angel.* This could have been no other than S. Timothy, who was then bishop of Ephesus. We must not suppose the faults, which are reproved by S. John, to belong individually to S. Timothy, but to some members of the Church. Bossuet, et alii.—*These things, saith he, who holdeth*, &c. That is, Christ, or the Angel who represented Christ, as appeareth by his titles repeated out of the last chapter.—*And hast not failed*, or fainted, in opposing the teachers of false doctrine.—*Thou has left thy first charity*, or first fervour, a common, yet a very dangerous disposition, and especially in a bishop, charged with the care of those under him.—*Do penance* … practise *the first works*, return to thy first fervour, or *I will remove thy candlestick out of its place.* The church of Ephesus is threatened, as in danger to lose its faith, which faith should be transplanted and received in other places. It is what God has divers times permitted, that churches flourishing in the profession of the true Christian faith should be perverted by infidelity and heresy, while the faith hath been planted in other kingdoms of the world. I need not bring instances, where candlesticks have been removed out of their places. Wi.—The Nicolaites were an infamous sect, who disturbed the rising Church by the superstitions and all the impurities of paganism. See S. Aug. de hæresib.—*To him*, to every one *that overcometh, I will give to eat of the tree* *of life*, (that is, eternal happiness, differently expressed in these letters) *which is in the paradise of my God.* It is spoke in the person of Christ, as man. Wi.  
**8** **Ver.** **8–11** **.** *To the Angel of the church* *of Smyrna.* To S. Polycarp, or some bishop there before him. No reprehension is given to this bishop, or to his church, but a commendation for suffering in poverty and tribulation, when they were rich in grace. Wi.—*Poverty.* He was poor in temporal things, but rich in grace and merits.—*Thou art blasphemed* by those false teachers, who call themselves Jews and Israelites, and the chosen people of God, waiting for the coming of the Messias, but are not to be looked upon as such; having refused to own their true Messias, Jesus Christ, they are *the Synagogue of* Satan, the greatest enemies of the true faith.—*You shall have tribulation ten days*, which several here understand for a long time, others for a short time, *ten times* being used in both senses. Wi.—The first death is that of the body, the second of the soul. Ven. Bede.  
**12** **Ver.** **12–17**. *To the Angel of the Church of Pergamus.* This Church is exhorted to *do penance*, and reprehended, as the seat or throne of Satan. It is only said, that the bishop lives where this satanical seat is, that *he had not denied* the *faith*, even under the persecution, when S. Antipas suffered martyrdom, of whom see Tillemont in the persecution under Domitian, tom. ii, p. 119, and note 523; and Bollandus, April 11th; though the acts themselves be not of great authority.—Thou hast *them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaites*, which is compared to that of *Baalam* who taught *Balac to cast a* scandal *before the children of Israel*, by which they were seduced by the women of the Moabites, and fell into the sin of fornication and idolatry. Num. 24 and 31:16.—*To him* *that overcometh, I will give the hidden manna;* a happiness in heaven, which the eye hath not seen, &c.—And *a white* [1] *stone*, with *a new name written*, as a mark of the happiness promised to all those who shall conquer. An allusion to the custom of giving a white stone to those that were tried and acquitted, and also to persons promoted to a dignity; and a black stone to such as were found guilty. See Acts 26:10. Wi.—This new name is the eternal recompense, unknown and despised by worldlings, but esteemed by the faithful, who know the excellence of the rewards promised by God. Calmet.  
**18** **Ver.** **18–29** **.** *To the Angel of the church of Thyatira.* Here is first a commendation of their constancy in the *faith*, in good *works, charity, patience*, and *ministry*, which chiefly regards their bishop, whoever he was at that time. The heretics, called Alogians, who rejected the Apocalypse, (chiefly because of the clear proofs of the divinity of the Word, or Son of God) pretended that there was no church at Thyatria, when S. John is supposed to have written his Apocalypse. They have no proof of this. This same church was afterwards perverted by the Montanists. See S. Epiphan. hær. li. p. 455. Here follows a reprehension that they permitted *the woman*, (here called by the name of *Jezabel*, [2] as was called the wife of Achaz, who persecuted the true prophets, and protected the false ones, 3 Kings 18) *to sedu* *ce* the *servants* of God, *to commit fornication*, and eat of things offered to idols. There is no probability that this Jezabel was wife to the bishop of that church. Had this been true, the bishop would have deserved a reprehension much more severe than is here given him. Alcazar thinks that by this woman was meant some heretical sect, or the corrupt synagogue of the Jews; but interpreters commonly understand some powerful woman thereabout among the infamous Nicolaites, who by her authority and artifices, brought many to embrace that sect.—*I give her time to do penance; and she will not*, or would *not repent.* It is Christ who speaks as God, for who but God gives sinners time to repent?—*Behold, I will cast her into a bed*, &c. Some understand a bed of sickness, others of corporal death, others eternal torments in hell, where she, and *they* that sin *with her*, shall be *in very great tribulation, unless* first *they do penance.*—*All the churches shall know that I am he, who searcheth the reins and* *hearts*, which God alone can do. See Ps. 7:10, Jer. 17:10. &c. It is God also who *will give to every one … according to his works.* See Ps. 61:13, Prov. 24:12, Rom. 2:6 and in divers other places.—*I wi* *ll not put upon you any other weight*, &c. That is, not the insupportable burden of the Jewish ceremonies, to which teachers of false doctrines would have you subject. Wi.—Whoever does not give in to this new doctrine of the Nicolaites and Gnostics, and does not approve the deep and abstruse doctrines of Satan, which they teach, shall have no new weight or punishment. Let them keep the doctrine once delivered. Calmet.—Yet in the faith which you have already learnt, remain steadfast, *till I come.*—To them who shall *overcome*, &c. *I will give power over* or above all *nations.* This shews that the saints, who are with Christ our Lord in heaven, receive power from him to preside over nations, and provinces, as patrons; and shall come with him at the end of the world to execute his will against those who have not kept his commandments. Ch.—*End.* This alludes to the day of judgment, when the faithful shall sit on thrones with Christ. And he shall inherit the morning star of perpetual bliss, that shall never set.—They shall triumph over all the wicked world, and under me *shall rule them*, as it were, *with a rod of iron*, being so much exalted above them.—As *the vessel of a potter*, shall all their present greatness *be broken.* To every such faithful servant, I will give *the morning star*, another expression to signify eternal light, or eternal happiness. Wi.

## Chapter 3

**1** **Ver.** **1–6** **.** *To the Angel of the church of Sardis*. He begins with a severe reprehension, *thou hast the name of being alive, and thou art dead*, which we may understand of the greatest part of them, and of being dead by the worst of deaths, which is that of sin. Wi.—In the style of the sacred writers, to live, is to be in the state of grace, and to bring forth good works; as, to be dead, is to live in sin, and in the neglect of Christian duties. Calmet.—Here we see that the opinion of men is no advantage to us, when our internal dispositions are not correspondent to our external appearance. For what we are in thy sight, O Lord, so much we are, and no more, says S. Austin.—The bishop is charged with this fault, that he did not watch and take care of his flock. He is admonished to repent, and to *strengthen* those that were not dead, but *ready to die.* [1] Wi.—God does not seek to surprise us and lay snares for us. But when he tells us that he will come like a thief, it is only to admonish us not to slumber. Had he wished to take us unawares, he never would have admonished us beforehand. Calmet.—*But thou hast a few names*, &c. That is, a few persons not yet defiled, neither as to their consciences, souls, nor bodies.—*They shall walk with me in white* apparel, &c. It is a new way of expressing the happiness of heaven. Wi.—White is the color of joy, festivity, and triumph. The Angels always appeared clothed in white. Calmet.  
**7** **Ver.** **7–13** **.** *To the Angel of the church of Philadelphia.* There were several towns of this name; here is understood that which was near Sardis, in Lydia. Here is no more than an admonition to persevere, to hold that which thou hast. Christ takes the title of the *Holy One*, and *True One, who hath the key of David;* i.e. being the son of David, and the promised Messias, hath supreme power in the Church: who opens the gate of salvation, and no one shuts it against his elect. Wi.—By the key in this place may be understood either the key of the Church, or of the kingdom of heaven. Jesus Christ has both, he opens and shuts the heavens by his infinite power. But in the Church on earth he has entrusted this key (his power) to his apostles and ministers; whatever is bound or loosened by them is ratified by him in the kingdom of his glory. Calmet.—*I have* set *before thee a door* open, by giving thee graces to save thee, which no one shall be able to hinder, *because thou hast* of thyself *little* power or strength, [2] *and hast kept my word*, and not denied the faith. Wi.—I have sent you to preach, and have given my blessing to your labours. You shall, notwithstanding all your adversaries, eventually succeed. S. Paul makes use of the same manner of expression. 1 Cor. 16. I see a great door is open to me, and at the same time many adversaries; and again, 2 Cor. 2 and Coloss. 4. On account of your little strength, your want of talents, eloquence, supernatural gifts, &c. I have not exposed you to great trials. Thus does the Almighty always proportion the trials he sends, and the temptations he permits in his servants, to the graces and strength he has given them.—Those who were neither Jews nor Christians, shall come and abjure at your feet their former errors, and shall evidently perceive that you are strengthened by me. Calmet.—Christ also promises that he will make the false abandoned Jews subject to the bishop and his Church, and to own them to be the beloved and chosen people. God promises to preserve them in *the hour* or time *of temptation* and persecutions, which should happen to all the inhabitants of the *earth.* Wi.—He here advertises him of the persecution which was about to take place, and by which he would try the fidelity of his servants. In v. 12 he relates the triumph and everlasting beatitude of the martyrs.—*He that* overcomes, *I will make him a pillar*, &c. so as to stand firm against his enemies, and to be secure of his endless happiness.—*I will write upon him the name of my God*, a subscribed citizen of the celestial Jerusalem, with *the new* name of Jesus, the Saviour and Redeemer of mankind. He alludes to the custom of writing names upon pillars, palaces, &c.—From the words *my God*, the Socinians pretend that Christ is not the true God, as we may find in the disputes which Servetus had with Calvin. Calvin answered the Socinians, as all Catholics do, that Christ was both God and man: this and divers things were spoken of Christ as he was man, but that many things in the Scriptures could not apply to him, unless he was also truly God. And by such places is clearly confuted the blasphemy and error of the Arians and Socinians. The argument concludes in the principles of the Catholics, who allow the authority of the Church in expounding the sense of the Scriptures; but the Calvinists, and all other pretended reformers, having shaken off that authority, and having allowed that the holy Scriptures are to be interpreted according to every man’s private judgment or spirit, this set Calvin and Servetus, every Calvinist and Socinians, upon the same level. Wi.  
**14** **Ver.** **14–22** **.** The seventh and last letter is *to the Angel of the Church of Laodicia.* Christ here takes the title of *the Amen*, [3] as if he said, I am the Truth.—*The beginning of the creation*, or of the creatures *of God*, to which is added in the first chapter, *the beginning and the end.*—*Thou art neither cold nor hot*, but *lukewarm.* A dreadful reprehension, whatever exposition we follow. According to the common interpretation, by the *cold* are meant those who are guilty of great sins; by the *hot*, such as are zealous and fervent in piety and the service of God; by the *lukewarm* or tepid, they who are slothful, negligent, indolent, as to what regards Christian perfection, the practice of virtue, and an exact observance of what regards the service of God. On this account they are many times guilty in the sight of God of great sins, they forfeit the favour and grace of God, fancying themselves good enough and safe, because they live as others commonly do, and are not guilty of many scandalous and shameful crimes, to which they see others addicted.—*I would thou wert* either *cold or hot*. This is not an absolute wish, because the condition of the cold is certainly worse in itself; but it is to be taken with regard to the different consequences, which oftentimes attend these two states, and to signify to us that the lukewarm may be farther from a true conversion, inasmuch as they are less sensible of the dangers to which they remain exposed, than such as commit greater sins. Their careless indevotion becomes habitual to them, they live and die with a heart divided betwixt God and the world; whereas greater and more shameful sinners are not without an abhorrence of such vices which they commit; a fear of punishment, of hell and damnation, strikes them by the mercies of God offered even to sinners, and makes them enter into themselves like the prodigal son; they detest their past lives, and by the assistance of God’s graces become both fervent and constant in the duties of a Christian life. Wi.—Tepidity in a Christian life, and in the service of God, is oftentimes more dangerous than absolute wickedness. The open sinner is easily made sensible of his danger; he experiences the stings and reproaches of conscience, whilst the tepid Christian lives without remorse, fear, or apprehension, and listens not to those who wish to shew him the danger of his situation. I dare venture to affirm, says S. Aug. that to fall into some public and manifest sin would be of advantage to the proud, that so those who by their self-complacency had so often fallen before, may now become displeased with themselves and humble. Calmet.—To the lukewarm it is said, *I will begin to vomit thee out of my mouth;* i.e. if thou continue in that state, I will permit thee to run on and be lost in thy sins. Thou blindly sayest within thyself, *I am rich*, &c. A false conscience generally attends a lukewarm soul and those who serve God by halves; they flatter themselves that all goes well enough with them, when they see they are not so vicious, as many others: but here the spirit of God, who penetrates the secret folds and windings of slothful souls, admonisheth them of their dangerous mistakes, that they are *wretched, poor, blind*, and *naked*, when God, by his grace, does not inhabit their souls, though they may have millions of gold and silver in this world. *I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire*, the love of God purified by trials and troubles in this life, to recover thy lost innocence, to be *clothed* with the habit of grace, to *anoin* *t thy eyes with eye-salve*, by a serious reflection on what regards thy eternal salvation.—I chastise *those whom I love.* He concludes all the former admonitions by telling them: first, that to be under trials and troubles, is a mark of God’s favour and his paternal care; secondly, to hearken to the voice of God, when he knocks at the door of their heart; and thirdly, he promises them the reward of eternal happiness—he that overcomes, shall *sit with me on my throne*: though this does not imply an equality of happiness, not even to all the saints, much less with God himself, but only that the elect shall be in the throne as it were of heaven, and partakers of heavenly happiness according to their past good works.—I should not here mention the wild and ridiculous fancies of one Mr. Brightman, when he pretends to expound to all men these letters to the seven bishops of Asia, were it not to shew how the obscure predictions of S. John’s revelation have been turned and abused by the loose interpretations of some of the late reformers, as may be seen more at large, when we mention their arbitrary fancies about the whore of Babylon and the popish antichrist. I shall here with Dr. Hammond, give the reader a taste of such licentious expositions of the divine oracles. The Calvinist, Mr. Brightman, pretended he had his expositions by divine inspirations, and so gave his commentary the title of *Revelation of the Revelation.* I shall quote his words out of Dr. Hammond. “Mr. Brightman assures his readers, that by the churches of *Sardis, Philadelphia*, and *Laodicia*, were meant Germany, France, and Britain. He says a most heavy trial was now suddenly to invade the Christian world … that the three said churches were most favourably admonished of this tempest by the epistles written to them *by* *name, nomination …* that he found and understood this to be so by divine inspiration, from the inscriptions of these letters, and so should be guilty of a sin against the Divine Majesty, if he concealed them.” Not to tire the reader with his fancies about *Ephesus* and *Pergamus*, which may be seen in Dr. Hammond. Rev. 2:13. “on those words, *in those days was Antipas*, &c. Mr. Brightman has this wanton fancy on the name Antipas, that it doth denote that the martyrs of his time (which was after Luther) should be antipapæ, or antipopes;” i.e. adversaries to the popes and popery. Dr. Hammond (p. 928) gives us Mr. Brightman’s conceit on the name *Thyatira*, which must be taken for the same as *Thygatheira*, signifying a young daughter, and so denotes the growth of piety in the Church from the year 1300, from Wycliffe’s time to 1520, that is, till it came to perfection in *Luther’s* days. Page 932. note *a*, “*Sardis*, according to Mr. Brightman,” says Dr. Hammond, “is the first reformed church in the antitype, to wit, that of Germany, which began at Wittenburg, by Luther, an. 1517. And the proof is, that Sardis is more to the south than Thyatira, and so must have more of truth in it; or, because there is no mention made of Balaam and Jezabel, which he resolved must signify the doctrines of Christian Rome, the absence of which must signify a breaking off from the Romish communion; or, that she (the German Church) had *a name to be living, but was dead*, by the doctrine of *consubstantiation* among the Lutherans, even after the reformation. This,” says Dr. Hammond, “were a strange way of interpreting dreams, which no oneirocritic would allow, but a much stranger of explaining prophecies.” Page 933, “*Philadelphia*, says Mr. Brightman, must needs be the Helvetian, Swedish, Genevan, French, Dutch, and Scotch reformed Churches. No reason again for it, but that the city of *Philadelphia* was yet farther south than *Sardis*, and so must needs signify more increase of reformation; 2. that the name of *J* *ezabel* was not in it; 3. that the word *Philadelphia*, signifying brotherly love, cannot be applied to any but this pattern of all piety (to which Mr. Brightman had so much kindness) the Church of Helvetia and Geneva. And the reformed Church of England must be that of *Laodicia*,.… because episcopacy was here retained, and so a mixture of cold with that *of heat*, and consequently is the *lukewarm* Church that is found fault with.” O the profound interpretations and bright inventions of Mr. Brightman! Wi.

## Chapter 4

**1** No sooner had S. John received in the preceding vision the documents he was to transmit to the seven Churches of Asia, when, behold, a new scene displays itself. Heaven opens, and S. John is invited up thither by the voice which had spoken to him before, and is told he shall see what is to happen in future ages. On a sudden appears a throne, and the Almighty himself seated upon it. The rainbow which surrounds the throne, denotes the covenant of reconciliation and peace between God and man. Walmesley.—*Behold a door open.* Here begins what may be looked upon as the second part of the Apocalypse, and from hence to the two last chapters are contained wars and victories of the Church over all its enemies, the devil, Jews, heathens, and heretics. These visions are so differently expounded, when applied to different events, that this alone may convince us how uncertain are those various interpretations. The servants of God are taught that they must expect to meet with many trials, afflictions, and persecutions; but this ought to be a great subject of consolation to the faithful, that they are assured of victory if they fight manfully, and of a recompense of endless happiness for their short labours. Such visions and majestic descriptions shew that S. John was inspired by the same spirit of God, as the ancient patriarchs and prophets.—*I will shew thee the things whi* *ch must come to pass hereafter;* i.e. after the things already revealed concerning the seven Churches, and therefore after the destruction of Jerusalem, which was about twenty years before S. John wrote this Apocalypse. Wi.  
**2** *I was in the spirit*, rapt as it were in an ecstacy into heaven, and saw a throne, and one sitting, representing God the Father. Wi.  
**3** *And he … was to the sight lik* *e the jasper*, [1] or had the appearance of jaspers, as to the colours with which he appeared, &c. Wi.  
**4** *About the throne were four and twenty seats*, or lesser thrones, with twenty-four seniors or senators upon them, representing the illustrious saints both of the Old and New Testament, *clothed in white garments*, in token of their innocence, and crowns of gold, signifying the glory of the heavenly inhabitants. Wi.—These four and twenty elders sitting round the throne of God, represent the judgment which the Almighty was about to pass upon the enemies of his Church. Thus in Daniel, when he was about to pronounce sentence against Antiochus Epiphanes, “thrones were placed, and the ancient of days sat, … the judgment sat, and the books were opened.” Dan. 7:9, 10. They represent kings and priests who attend on the Sovereign Judge. It appears as if God intended to designate by the number the ancient patriarchs and the twelve apostles, who judge with the Lord, and condemn the injustice of their persecutors. Calmet.  
**5** *Lightnings*, a symbol of God’s majesty and power.—*Seven lamps burning*, which signified the seven spirits of God, the chief spirits that attend his throne. See C. 1:4. Wi.—The lightnings, loud voices, and thunders, which come from the throne of God, announce alarms and severe hardships, such as persecutions, heresies, calamities, &c. by which he tries the fidelity of his servants on earth. And the seven spirits of God, who appear under the form of burning lamps, are seven Angels, as before mention, (C. 1:4) standing ready to execute the divine commands. Walmesley.  
**6** *A sea of glass, like crystal*, calm and transparent, and may signify that the saints had passed a boisterous sea of troubles in this world, which is now changed into everlasting tranquillity.—*Four living creatures*, or animals. Alcazar (p. 364) takes notice of thirty different expositions of these animals. He understands the apostles, bishops, and preachers of the Christian faith: others, four of the chief Angels or celestial spirits. Several others expound them of the four evangelists: yet this was before S. John himself had written his gospel. Wi.—The extensive sea of glass, here described transparent as crystal, represents what may be called the floor of heaven. Before the throne and round it stand four living creatures, of an extraordinary shape, which denote the four great prophets, Isaias, Jeremias, Ezechiel, and Daniel. Their bodies are described full of eyes, both before and behind, an emblem of their prophetic sight, that penetrates into all ages past, present, and to come. And their being also full of eyes within, indicates that their extensive knowledge arises from an interior divine inspiration. They have each six wings, in the same manner as the seraphim appeared to the prophet Isaias. C. 6:2. Some have imagined these four symbolical animals to represent the four evangelists; but we think improperly, as S. John was still living and there present in person. The first animal is here said to resemble a lion, the king of beasts, because the prophet Isaias, represented by it, was descended of the royal race of David. The second animal resembles a calf, and represents the prophet Jeremias in his character of priest; the calf, which was the principal victim in Jewish sacrifices, being on that account the emblem of the priesthood. The third animal, exhibiting Ezechiel, has the countenance of a man; because God, in speaking to that prophet, always addresses him by the name of son of man. The fourth animal, denoting Daniel, resembles a flying eagle, on account of the sublime oracles of this prophet, who soars to the highest objects, and views the succession of all the great empires that were to rise up in the world to the end of time. Probably these four principal prophets are to be understood to represent all the prophets of the old law. Walmesley.  
**7** *Like a lion*, &c. The qualities in these animals are observed to be courage and strength in the lion; profit to human life, by the calf; reason and wisdom, by the face of man: soaring high, and rapidity or swiftness, by the eagle: whether we understand those spiritual perfections to belong to blessed spirits, or to the apostles in general, or to the four evangelists. Wi.  
**8** *Each of them six wings.* See the like visions, Ezech. 1:4, Isai. 6:2. These signify their swiftness in executing God’s just commands.—*Full of eyes:* a symbol of knowledge and watchfulness.—*They rested not day and night.* There is no night in heaven; but hereby is signified, that they praised God without intermission for all eternity, saying: Thou art worthy, O Lord, our [2] God, &c. Wi.—They repeat the word *holy* three times, probably in honour of the blessed trinity. And the four and twenty elders prostrate before the throne, in token of their acknowledging all their happiness and pre-eminence to be his gift. Walmesley.  
**10** Nothing is so well adapted to give us an idea of the infinite majesty of God, and of the sovereign respect which is due to him, as this description. How ought Christians to appear in the presence of the God of armies, if what is most august and most elevated in heaven acknowledges its lowness and nothing before this tremendous Majesty? Calmet.

## Chapter 5

**1** *A book written within and without.* [1] Books were then skins, membranes, or parchments, and when written on both sides part of the writing appeared, though they were rolled up.—*Sea* *led with seven seals*, as containing mysteries and secrets of high importance. Wi.  
**3** *No man was able*, [2] &c. As to the contents, some understand the prophecies and mysteries both of the Old and New Testament; others, the events that should afterwards happen to the Church of Christ, as various persecutions against Christians. Alcazar would have the sense of these words to be, that only Christ and his Spirit could open the book to others, and make them believe and know the punishments prepared for the wicked, and the reward reserved for God’s faithful servants. Wi.  
**5** *Behold the lion,* *of the tribe of Juda*, &c. viz. Jesus Christ, who was descended from that tribe, denominated a *lion* on account of his great power, by which title we find him designated also in the prophecy of Jacob. Gen. 49:9. Calmet.—It is he who has merited by his triple victory over death, sin, and hell, the great honour of opening the book, and revealing the secrets therein contained.  
**6** *I saw.… a lamb st* *anding as it were slain*, with the prints and marks of its wounds. It was of this lamb (i.e. of our Saviour Jesus Christ) that S. John Baptist said: “Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world.” Jo. 1:29. Wi.—Here again Jesus Christ is plainly marked out, the Lamb of God, the victim of expiation, who by his death has reconciled us with his Father; and who, even in heaven, bears the marks of his passion, and by the wounds therein received continually inclines his Father to shew us mercy. He has seven horns, as so many crowns and marks of his omnipotence; and seven eyes, to represent his infinite knowledge and wisdom. Calmet.—*Having seven horns and seven eyes*, (to signify his power and his knowledge,) *which are the seven spirits* subject to Christ. See C. 1:4. It is observed that in the Revelation of S. John, the number seven is divers times applied to signify a multitude, and a number implying perfection, and three and a half for a small number. Thus are represented the seven candlesticks, seven churches, seven spirits, seven seals, seven trumpets, seven vials, &c. Wi.  
**7** **Ver.** **7–8** **.** *He … took the book*, [3].… *and when he had opened* it, or was about to open it, (in the Greek is only, he took it: which was a sign that he would open it) … *the four and twenty ancients fell down before the Lamb*, to adore him, as appears by what follows, v. 13.—*Having every one of them har* *ps* to celebrate his praise, *and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of the saints:* which shews that the saints in heaven offer up before the throne of the Divine Majesty the prayers of the faithful. Wi.—*Harps*, &c. These harps are symbols of the praise which good men render to God; and the vials full of odours, represent the prayers of the saints. In conformity with this idea, S. John wishes to represent these four and twenty ancients as so many senators, who present to the Almighty the prayers and homages of good men on earth. Estius. Clemens Alex.—This also is an imitation of what was practised in the temple, in which were always around the altar, in times of sacrifice, Levites with musical instruments, priests with vials to contain the wine and blood, and censers to hold the incense. Calmet.—*The prayers of the saints.* Here we see that the saints in heaven offer up to Christ the prayers of the faithful upon earth. Ch.  
**9** *They sung a new canticle*, &c. called *new*, as belonging to the New Testament, or alliance of the new law of Christ. Wi.—*Canticle*; that is, *excellent.* The Scripture generally attaches the epithet *new* to canticles. New canticles are always more agreeable, says Pindar. Grotius.—*And hast redeemed*, &c. The twenty-four ancients here may well represent all, who are in possession of beatitude. They all acknowledge it is to Jesus Christ they are indebted for the felicity they enjoy; it is he that has assembled at the foot of God’s throne all the nations of the world, faithful souls from every tribe and tongue, and people and nation, by his blood. Calmet.  
**10** *And hast made us to our God*, &c. See 1 Pet. 2:5, 9. Wi.—All Christians may justly be styled kings and priests of God, by the spiritual empire they possess over their passions and the world; and by the continual offering they make on the altar of their hearts, by means of the prayers they daily offer up to God. Origen.—Thus they say, we shall reign on the earth by the empire we shall exercise over our passions; and by the union we shall have with Jesus Christ and his Church, triumph over all who have persecuted us. Estius. Andræas.  
**11** *The number of them was thousands of* *thousands.* [4] In the Greek also, ten thousand times ten thousand. Wi.  
**12** *The Lamb is worthy … to receive power and divinity*, [5] &c. The Socinians and new Arians from hence pretend that the Lamb, Jesus Christ, is not the same true God with the Father, but only deserved divinity, or to be made God in an inferior and an improper sense. The argument is of no force at all in the ordinary Greek, where for divinity is read *riches.* The sense is, thou art worthy to have thy *power and divinity* acknowledged and praised by all creatures both in heaven and earth: and the following words are a confutation of the Socinians, “I heard all saying: To him that sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb, benediction, and honour, and glory, and power, forever and ever,” where the same divine power is attributed to the Father and to the Son of God, Jesus, true God and true man. Wi.

## Chapter 6

**1** *I saw that the Lamb had opened one of the seven seals*, or the first seal. The interpreters are much divided in expounding what is to be understood by the sealed up contents, and in applying them to such and such persecutions, persons, and events, by all which it appears that there is no certainty as to such applications and expositions, even of particular ancient fathers; though at the same time it is both certain and evident that many pretended interpretations, (that is, arbitrary inventions, from the private spirit of heretics) are both false and groundless, *contradictor* *y to the unexceptionable authority* (to use Dr. W.’s words) *of the primitive fathers, and inconsistent with the doctrine and belief of the Catholic Church*, as I may have occasion to shew that the ridiculous fable is of this number, of so many popes being antichrist, and the beast of this Apocalypse. I shall, for the satisfaction of the Christian reader, as I hinted in the preface of this book, give a short account of those expositions that are not improbable. Wi.  
**2** *A white horse*, such as conquerors used to ride upon at a solemn triumph. This is commonly understood of our Saviour, Christ, who, by himself and by his apostles, preachers, martyrs, and other saints, triumphed over all the adversaries of his Church. He had *a bow* in his hand, the doctrine of his gospel, piercing like an arrow the hearts of the hearers; and the *crown* given him, was a token of the victory of him who went forth *conquering, that he might conquer.* Wi.—He that sitteth on the white horse is Christ, going forth to subdue the world by his gospel. The other horses that follow represent the judgments and punishment, that were to fall on the enemies of Christ and his Church: the red horse signifies war; the black horse famine; and the pale horse (which has death for its rider) plagues or pestilence. Ch.—*White horse;* viz. Jesus Christ, who came to subdue all nations to the faith. The *bow* signifies the gospel, and the word of God, those powerful arms, of which S. Paul so often speaks, as being so necessary for all who are engaged in bringing souls to the faith of Christ. The *crown* marks the sovereign power of Jesus Christ, and the assurance of conquest. Cornelius. Bossuet. Du Pin.  
**3** **Ver.** **3–4** **.** *Opened the second seal*, &c. portending wars and shedding of blood, and so he is said to have power *to take away p* *eace from the earth*. Wi.—*Another red horse.* This red horse signifies the cruel persecutions, which the Roman emperors carried on against the Christian religion. For this end, it is said immediately after, one sat thereon, to take peace from the earth, and kill one another; for this purpose was a great sword given to him. Andræas. Menochius. Grotius.  
**5** *The third seal … a black horse.* This is also commonly expounded of wars and persecutions, and particularly of famine, by the *scales* in the rider’s hand, and by two pounds of wheat being sold for a penny: a great price, considering the value of money at that time. Wi.—The black horse represents the public miseries, famines, &c. which, particularly the latter, the Roman empire frequently experienced during the reign of the persecuting emperors. The *balance*, which the rider is said to hold in his hand, represents the strict manner in which people would measure out whatever they sold during the time of famine. Andræas. Hamm. Bossuet.  
**7** **Ve** **r.** **7–8** **.** *The fourth seal.… a pale horse*, the rider’s name *death*. It is also expounded of trials, afflictions, persecutions, and especially of plagues, over *four parts of the earth*, by which may be denoted the great power and extent of the Roman empire. In the Greek we read, *over the fourth part of the earth;* which some reconcile, by observing that the Roman empire had dominions under it in all the four parts of the world, east, west, north, and south; and that its dominions might be said to comprehend the fourth part of the world. Wi.—By the pale horse, and the rider, death, who sat upon it, followed by hell, are meant that dreadful mortality which ever attends famines, &c. He had power to kill with sword, with famine, &c. All these evils came upon the Roman people, and history has preserved the memory of them, to shew the truth of the prophecy here delivered by S. John. Grotius. Calmet.  
**9** **, &c.** After the opening of the fifth seal, the souls of the martyrs under the altar cried aloud for justice, saying, *how long*, &c. Out of zeal for God’s honour, and the good of the Church, they pray that the enemies of Christ, and of the Christian faith, may be humbled, and that all may acknowledge and fear the justice of God, by the punishment of his enemies, and the reward of his faithful servants. S. Jerom, by *under the altar*, understands Christ himself, under whom, as under their head, are all the martyrs. Some who doubted or held that the blessed were not admitted to see God, in heaven before the day of general judgment, have turned this expression, *under the altar*, or at least the expressions of some of the fathers upon these words, as if they were favourable to their error, which is sufficiently disproved, even by the words that follow, that *white robes were given to each of* *them one*, in which they are said to walk with him wherever he goeth. C. 3:4 and C. 14:4. Wi.—*Under the altar.* Christ, as man, is this altar, under which the souls of the martyrs live in heaven: as their bodies are here deposited under our altars.—*Revenge our blood.* They ask not this out of hatred to their enemies, but out of zeal for the glory of God, and a desire that the Lord would accelerate the general judgment, and the complete beatitude of all his elect. Ch.—These holy souls, who had been slain for the word of God, do not beg the Almighty to revenge their blood, through any hatred to their enemies, but through the great zeal with which they were animated, to see the justice of God manifested: that by this severity they might be moved to fear him, and be converted to him. Thus in the Scripture we often read of the prophets beseeching the Almighty to fill their enemies with confusion, to humble them, &c. Perer. Bossuet. Du Pin, &c.—*And white robes.* To console them, they each had given them a white robe, as a mark of their innocence, and as an assurance that on account of it they would in due time receive the full measure of beatitude. They should rest yet a little while, most probably to the day of final retribution, when the number of those destined to be their brethren in bliss should be completed. Then they should altogether receive full recompense, and their persecutors be covered with confusion. S. Aug. serm. xi. de sanctis. Greg. Mag. lib. ii. Moral. cap. iv.  
**12** At the opening of the *sixth seal.… a great earthquake*, &c. Many think that these dreadful signs, of the sun turning black, &c. are not to happen till the time of antichrist, a little before the end of the world. See Matt. 14, Luke 21, Isaias 13 and 34, Ezec. 33, Dan. 12. &c. Others apply these prodigies to God’s visible chastisements, on the heathen emperors and persecutors of the Christians, before the first Christian emperor Constantine. Wi.—*And I saw.* The sixth seal being opened, S. John sees painted before him the severe and terrible manner in which the Almighty would revenge himself on his enemies. It may refer either to the time of Constantine, when we behold the Christian religion triumphing on the ruins of paganism, and after his death, and that of his sons, the empire of Rome given up a prey to barbarians, Rome itself taken and pillaged, and all the provinces thrown into dreadful disorder and consternation; or it may likewise refer to the day of general judgment, when the Almighty will make sinners drink the wine of his indignation, in presence of all the just; of which dreadful time of vengeance all other particular judgments are only imperfect figures. Victorin. Bede. Tichon.—S. John, in imitation of the ancient prophets, makes use of the earthquake, &c. hyperbolically, to mark more strongly the dreadful and horrible evils with which the Roman empire, and its persecuting emperors, were to be overwhelmed. Rome itself was filled with wars and seditions, both at home and abroad. The emperors were all destroyed by the Almighty in a most singular manner; witness Maxentius, who was thrown headlong into the Tiber; Maximin Jovius, who, under a horrible and incurable disease, owned the hand of the Almighty afflicting him; Maximin Daia, who, being overcome in battle, fled away in disguise, and at last, seized with a strange disease, his bowels were all consumed, he lost his eyes, and died reduced to a mere skeleton. Witness likewise Licinius, who, being engaged with Constantine, was always beaten, and at length strangled. Maximian also, the rival of Constantine, who strangled himself in Marseilles, where he had been confined. Calmet.  
**14** *And every mountain.* In the dreadful confusion of the Roman empire, in the time of Constantine, so great was the revolution, that mountains appeared, as it were, moved out of their places; islands shifted from their accustomed situations. We behold at one time seven persons, Maximin Galerius, Maxentius, Severus Cæsar, Maximin, Alexander, Maximin Hercules, and Licinius, all aiming at the empire. The first six perished in nine years, from 305 to 314: Licinius was strangled in 324. All these were enemies of the Christian religion. Constantine, who supported it, remained sole master of the empire. Calmet.

## Chapter 7

**1** *I saw four Angels*, &c. Though some understand here evil spirits, whom God may make use of as instruments to punish the wicked, yet we may rather, with other interpreters, understand good angels sent from God to guard and protect his faithful servants both from evil spirits and wicked men. Wi.  
**2** *Having the seal.* This sign is generally supposed to be the sign of the cross. In the East, it was the custom to impress some indelible mark upon the soldiers. This sign amongst the ancient Christians was used on every occasion. Calmet.  
**3** *Hurt not the earth*, &c. Some understand Christ himself, who gives his commands in this manner to the Angels; others, an Angel of a higher rank or order.—*Till we seal the servants of our God in their foreheads*, which may be expounded, let not persecutions and trials come upon them till they are strengthened by the spirit and grace of God, with which S. Paul sometimes says the servants of God are *signed* and *sealed.* See 2 Cor. 1:22, Ephes. 1:13. He alludes to the passages of Ezech. (C. 9:4) where God bids an Angel mark with the letter Tau the foreheads of those who should not be hurt by the judgments that were to fall upon Jerusalem; so God would protect the faithful Christians, who believed and put their trust in Christ crucified, and who from the first ages, in testimony of this faith, used to sign themselves by making the sign of the cross on their foreheads, of which the letter Tau was a figure or resemblance. See Tertul. lib. de Corona militis. I beg the reader’s patience, if I here set down what I find in the great Synopsis Papismi, in folio, put out by Mr. Andrew Willet, and dedicated first to queen Elizabeth, and afterwards to king James the first. Among his demonstrations, as he calls them, that the pope is the antichrist, (Controv. iv. q. 10. p. 232 and 233) he tells us in plain terms, “that the sign of the cross is one of the visible signs of antichrist. And who,” saith he, “hath taught the papists that the sign of the cross is to be borne or made on men’s foreheads? And that with crossing the forehead we are preserved from dangers? The superstitious marks of the cross *had their beginning from the* *beast’s name*, since the number of the beast’s name in the Revelation of S. John is by these Greek letters, χξς. The first letter, χ, is a cross; the middle letter, ξ, (in Latin, **X**) is also a side long cross; and the last letter, ς, contains both ς and τ of which the latter is called a headless cross;” and then Mr. Willet concludes in these words, “And thus it *plainly appears*, that the marks whereby the papists say they honour Christ, are rather a dishonour to him, and are *in very deed the cognizance of antichrist.”* Such an ingenious, and at the same time learned fancy, may perhaps outvie even those we have cited out of Mr. Brightman, and may be equally serviceable to any country parson on the fifth of November, or on any day when he shall think fit to hold forth against the pope or popery. I suppose that Mr. Willet did not know that the Christians in the first ages (as all Catholics to this day) made so frequent use of the sign of the cross, as it is witnessed by Tertullian above two hundred years before even any Protestant pretended that the popes began to be antichrists, or the great antichrist. And this, says he, they do by *a tradition* from father to son. *At every setting forwar* *d or going about any thing, at coming home or going out, at putting on our clothes, at going to bathe, to table, to light a candle, to bed, to sit down, to any thing, we make the sign of the cross on our foreheads. And this* *is a* **tradition.** The like is witnessed by S. Chrys. S. Cyril of Jerusalem, and many of the Fathers. At the same time that with our hand we make the sign of the cross, we say these words, “in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;” the words used when any one is made a Christian, according to the command of Christ. So that the action itself puts us in mind that Jesus Christ died for us on the cross; and by the words, we make a profession of our Christian faith, that we believe in one God and three Persons. Can we do this too often? Dare we be ashamed of doing it? Was ever any thing more ridiculous than to call this *in very deed the cognizance of antichrist?* What must Mr. Willet have thought of the Protestants, or what can they think of him, and such like folio scribblers, to prove the popes the beast of S. John’s Revelation? What must, I say, Mr. Willet think of the public liturgy, or the book of common prayer, approved and used by the Church of England in his time, and which ordains that the *sign of the cross shall be made by the priest on the forehead of every one that is baptized?* This, according to Mr. Willet, is (when any one is made a Christian) to give him the badge, and *visible sign of antichrist*, to the dishonour of Christ, and what *in very deed is the cognizance of antichrist.* Wi.  
**4** *I heard the number of them that we* *re sealed.* By these determinate numbers need only be understood a great number of Jews converted and saved, though much greater was the number of the saved taken from among the Gentiles of all nations, of which it is said, *I saw a great multitude, which no man could number*, &c. Wi.—The number of one hundred and forty-four thousand is not to be taken in a literal and strict sense, but to express in general terms the great number of the elect; for it appears that the tribe of Dan, which certainly must have produced some elect, is not mentioned, and the tribe of Joseph is put in lieu of that of Ephraim: so that if it be supposed that these numbers must be taken literally, the tribe of Joseph would have produced a double number to that of any other tribe, since Manasses was his son, and the tribe of Dan would have produced none. Ven. Bede.  
**10** *Salvation to our God;* i.e. our salvation is from God, to whom be praise for ever, *Amen, benediction*, or blessings, *thanksgiving.* &c. Wi.  
**14** **4** **.** *White in the blood of the Lamb.* That is, they have been cleansed and purified from sin, by the death, merits, and grace of Christ crucified. Wi.—The whole of this verse must be understood in a mystical sense, for we are said to make our garments white in the blood of the Lamb, when we enter into his Church by baptism, or wash away our sins by penance or martyrdom. Calmet.  
**15** *Therefore the* *y are before the throne of God … in his temple*; i.e. therefore are they now happy in heaven, where the temple was represented to be, as observed before.—*He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell*, or dwelleth *over them.* Wi.  
**17** *The Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne*, God and man, *shall rule* [1] *them* as a shepherd does his flock. By the Greek, *And shall lead them unto fountains of living* *waters;* [2] lit. to the fountains of life of waters; shall bless them with everlasting happiness. Wi.—He represents the happiness of the saints, under the idea of being exempt from all the wants and evils of this life. For we are not able, according to truth itself, to conceive the happiness that is prepared for us; wherefore we must content ourselves with considering what it is not, rather than what it is. He, nevertheless, seems to compare heaven to a temple or palace, in which we observe ministers and servants all in their proper order, his counsellors (if we may be allowed the expression) and friends seated in presence of their prince, and the souls of the just singing the praises of the Most High.

## Chapter 8

**1** *There was silence in heaven:* which is to represent as it were a general consternation, and an expectation of dreadful events at the opening of the seventh seal, and when seven Angels stood prepared to sound seven trumpets. Wi.  
**3** *Stood before the altar, having a golden censer*. In the visions is an allusion to the tabernacle and its parts. The altar of perfumes was in the sanctum, hard by the entrance into the sanctum sanctorum, and here the golden altar is said to be before the throne of God. The incense from the censer is said to be the prayers of all the Saints, which the Angel offered up. The altar seems to signify our Saviour Christ, as the prayers of all the faithful are always made through the merits of Christ, our only chief Mediator or Redeemer. By the fire cast upon the earth, (v. 5) is signified the fire of divine charity, now to be exercised by the ways of justice, to draw persons to their conversion by punishments. Wi.—We may observe both in this and other places of the Apocalypse, that S. John makes continual allusions to what was done in the temple of Jerusalem, for which he gives us symbolical reasons. Thus on the present occasion, the incense which was offered morning and evening in the temple, on the golden altar, is represented as done here in heaven. Calmet.  
**7** *The first Angel sounded*, &c. From this place to the eleventh verse of chap. 20 the visions are differently expounded. Some interpret them, without applying them to any particular events, as general comminations, in a mystical and allegorical sense of the many persecutions which God permits to happen to his Church. Others think that they are all predictions, which shall not happen till a little time before the end of the world, in antichrist’s time, after which will follow the day of the general judgment, the punishment of the wicked, and the reward of the just. But there are others, both ancient and later writers, as in particular Alcazar, the bishop of Meaux (Bossuet,) Pere Alleman, to whom we may add among the Protestants, Dr. Hammond, whom the bishop of Meaux calls the most learned of all the English Protestants. According to the interpretations which these writers have followed, these predictions of S. John (except the last persecution, when the devil shall be let loose, C. 20:7 in the time of the great antichrist) have already happened in the three first ages, during the persecutions of the heathen emperors, as I shall briefly take notice. *Hail* therefore, and *fire, blood, falling of stars*, &c. some look upon as mystical representations, to signify that a great many trials and persecutions shall happen to the good, and a great many punishments and chastisements shall fall upon the wicked; with this grand difference, that the sufferings of the good shall be short and momentary, and their reward a crown of endless glory; but the wicked, if any of them escape punishments in this world, can never escape eternal torments with the devils in the next. 2. It is also a very common opinion, that all these disasters shall happen in a great measure, literally about antichrist’s time, a very short time before the end of the world. 3. Others apply all these events to the judgments which God’s justice exercised either upon the Jews, in the time of Trajan and Adrian, or upon the heathen Roman emperors, and upon the pagan city of Rome, for persecuting the servants of God. Wi.—As these Angels with their trumpets, according to Pastorini, denote the sufferings of the Church during the seven ages that it lasts, it may not be improper to point out the time, according to his opinion, when each Angel sounded the trumpet. Thus the first trumpet denotes the persecutions of the first three centuries, in which the Christians suffered death by the sword, (denoted by blood) by being stoned, (denoted by the hail) and by fire, when the third part of the trees were burnt, that is, the third part of the clergy were destroyed. Pas.  
**8** The great mountain denotes the heresy of Arius, which caused the greatest troubles in the Church, and destroyed many churches, which are here denoted by the ships. Pas.  
**10** *A great star fell.* The bishop of Meaux thinks this agrees very well to Cochebas, or Barcochebas, who in Adrian’s time pretended to be the true Messias of the Jews; his name also signifying a star. He was the chief cause of those wars, and of the utter destruction of the Jews. Wi.—The third trumpet points out to us the punishment that falls upon the Roman empire, in its destruction by the northern nations. These people spread themselves over the third part of the rivers and provinces of ancient Rome. The star is called wormwood, from the bitter calamities and miseries which they inflicted upon the Roman empire. Pas.  
**12** *T* *he third part of the sun was smitten.* This may signify a third part of men killed in those wars, or (according to the opinion that refers all to antichrist’s time) that in those days the sun and moon shall not give above a third part of their light. Wi.—Here we behold a noble figure of the Church, which whilst in its most flourishing state, like the sun, is suddenly obscured, and a third part extinguished by the heresy and schism of the Greeks, under Photius, which began in 866, and infected all orders of Christians, clergy and laity, princes and individuals, signified by the sun, moon, and stars. Pas.  
**13** *The voice of one eagle:* in divers Greek copies, of an Angel, saying, *Wo, wo, wo!* It is to foretell, in general, greater punishments and miseries. The Prot. translation has followed those Greek copies that read an *Angel;* but Dr. Wells, in his amendments, has restored that reading of an *eagle* which the ancient Latin interpreter had met with. Wi.—An eagle, on account of its swiftness, is here represented as chosen to announce by its cry of *wo* on the three succeeding ages of the Church, greater disasters to be sustained than in the preceding ages. Pas.

## Chapter 9

**1** *The fifth Angel … and I saw a star*, &c. This again may be to represent the confusion of all things in antichrist’s time, or it may signify the fall and apostacy of great and learned men from the Christian faith. Bossuet applies it to the fall of Theodotus, of Byzantium, towards the end of the second age; but certainly no great stress can be laid on such arbitrary applications, which it is no hard matter to invent, as may be seen by the different fancies we may meet with about the *locusts*, &c. Wi.—Here is a description of the rise and progress of the reformation. This trumpet begins with announcing to us the fall of a star from heaven; a very just emblem of the apostacy of Luther, who in quality of a priest and religious man is styled a star, but renouncing his faith and vows, may truly be said to have fallen from heaven upon the earth. Past. hic.—*To him* (i.e. to the Angel, not to the fallen star) *was given the key of the bottomless pit*, which properly signifies hell. Wi.  
**2** *And the smoke*, &c. Luther and his followers propagated and defended their new doctrines with such heat and violence, as to occasion every where seditions and insurrections, which they seemed to glory in. Luther openly boasted of it. “You complain,” said he, “that by our gospel the world is become more tumultuous; I answer, God be thanked for it; these things I would have so to be, and wo to me if such things were not.”—*The sun was darkened*, &c. The light of faith, which is the word of God, may well be represented by the sun, according to that of the Psalm 118:105. “Thy word, O Lord, is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my paths.” And as the air is the spring of man’s respiration and life, it may be a just type of morality, which gives spiritual life and worth to all human actions. By the sun, therefore, and air being darkened, we are to understand faith and morality obscured and perverted by the novel doctrines of the reformers. Past. hic.  
**3** *There came out locusts;* devils, in antichrist’s time, when the chief devil, Abaddon*, the destroyer*, shall be as it were let loose. Others by locusts, understand the Goths and those barbarous people that made an irruption into the Roman empire, in the time of Decius, about an. 250. Others again, by locusts, understand heretics, and especially those heretics that spring from the Jews, and with them denied the divinity of our Saviour Christ, as Theodotus, Praxeas, Noetus, Paul of Samosata, Sabellius, Arius, &c. These were the great enemies of Christian religion, and instruments of the devil: they tormented and infected the souls of men, stinging them like scorpions with the poison of their heresies. They had power for five months, by which is signified for a short term, but had no power to hurt those who were sealed with the seal of God in their foreheads. God protected, at least from sin, his faithful servants. It is to no purpose to give the reader divers fancies and inventions about their shape, their heads, tails, hair, teeth, &c. nor is it worth my while to confute such writers as Mr. Willet, who, Brightman-like, makes Abaddon the pope, and the locusts to be friars mendicant. With this fifth trumpet ended the first of the three woes, as we are told v. 12. Wi.—The locusts are commonly understood of heretics. They are not able to hurt the green tree; that is, such as have a lively faith, working by charity; but only the reprobate. The latter are represented as *prepared to battle*, as being ever ready to contend; they wear counterfeit gold on their heads, for all is but pretence and fiction; in shape they are as *men*, in smoothness of speech as *women;* in fury and rage against all that opposes them, as *lions;* their breasts and hearts are as hard as iron; they are full of noise and shuffling; the sting of their pestiferous doctrine is worse than that of a scorpion; but their reign is generally but for a short time. Ch.—Heretics are compared to locusts, says S. Jerom, because they are a species of insects extremely hurtful to mankind, as they occasion famine, eat up the harvest, and even strip the trees and the vines. With very great propriety then may the locusts here mentioned be understood of the first reformers, not only on account of their rapacity, but also for their number. Luther was their leader, by allowing every one to be his own interpreter of Scripture, the effects of which we have described by Dudithius, a learned Protestant divine, in his epistle to Beza. “What sort of people are our Protestants, straggling to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, sometimes to this side, and sometimes to that? You may, perhaps, know what their sentiments in matters of religion are to-day; but you can never certainly tell what they will be to-morrow. In what article of religion do these churches agree, which have cast off the bishop of Rome? Examine all of them from top to bottom, and you will scarce find one thing affirmed by one, which is not immediately condemned by another for wicked doctrine.” The same confusion of opinions is thus described by an English Protestant, the learned Dr. Walton: “Aristarchus heretofore could scarcely find seven wise men in Greece, but with us scarce are to be found so many idiots; for all are doctors, all are divinely learned; there is not so much as the meanest fanatic, or jack-pudding, who does not give you his own dreams for the word of God.” Past. hic.  
**4** *Nor any green thing.* The Greek and Latin texts express it *every* green thing; meaning, that though the locusts, or the sects of Protestants, are allowed by the Almighty to seduce some of all sorts from the Church, yet that the generality of the faithful will be preserved unhurt. Past.  
**7** *And the shapes of the locusts.* We now come to the description of these locusts, which expresses the spirit of sedition and rebellion that animated the reformers and their proselytes. Luther proclaimed himself the leader in this as well as in other articles of the new discipline: see his works, particularly Contra statem Ecclesiæ et falsò nominatum ordinem Episcoporum, lib. contra Sylvest. Prieras, De Sæculari potestate et Contra Rusticos, &c. Erasmus thus describes the effects of the inflammatory doctrine of these ministers of evangelical liberty: “I saw them (the people) come forth from their sermons with fierce looks and threatening countenances,” like men “that just come from hearing bloody invectives and seditious speeches.” Accordingly, we found “these evangelical people always ready to rise up in arms, and equally as good at fighting as at disputing.” The learned Protestant historian, Dr. Heylin, in his Cosmography, (B. i.) says of the Calvinists: “Rather than their discipline should not be admitted, and the episcopal government destroyed in all the Churches of Christ, they were resolved to depose kings, ruin kingdoms, and to subvert the fundamental constitutions of all civil states.”—*And on their heads*, &c. These crowns shew clearly their general spirit of independence; and their faces being as the faces of men, indicate the presumption with which they announced themselves as teachers of orthodox and holy doctrine. Past. hic.  
**8** **Ver** **.** **8** **.** *And they had hair as the hair of women.* This latter allusion, unhappily for the sectaries, betrays too plainly their sensual disposition towards that sex, their shameful doctrine on that score, and the scandalous example of their practice. Luther, in despite of a vow he had solemnly made to God of observing continence, married; and married a nun, equally bound as himself to that sacred religious promise! But, as S. Jerom says, “it is rare to find a heretic that loves chastity.” Luther’s example had indeed been anticipated by Carlostadius, a priest and ringleader of the Sacramentarians, who had married a little before; and it was followed by most of the heads of the reformation. Zuinglius, a priest and chief of that sect which bore his name, took a wife. Bucer, a religious man of the order of S. Dominic, became a Lutheran, left his cloister, and married a nun. Œcolampadius, a Brigittin monk, became a Zuinglian, and also married. Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, had also his wife. Peter Martyr, a canon regular, embraced the doctrine of Calvin; but followed the example of Luther, and married a nun. Ochin, general of the Capuchins, became a Lutheran, and also married. Beza, the most celebrated minister in the Calvinistic party, being asked in his old age, by an intimate acquaintance of his, (Deshayes, governor of Montargis) what was the leading reason which connected him so closely with the Calvinists? Beza called in his mistress, a beautiful young girl who lived with him, and said: “That is the principle reason which convinces me of the excellence of my religion.” Marsollier’s Life of S. Francis of Sales, book iii.—Thus the principal leaders in the reformation went forth preaching the new gospel, with two marks upon them—apostacy from the faith, and open violation of the most sacred vows. The passion of lust, it is also well known, hurried Henry VIII. of England, into a separation from the Catholic Church, and ranked him amongst the reformers. Past. hic.—*Teeth o* *f lions.* What is more known than the truth of this representation? Did not the reformers, wherever they got footing, pillage the churches, seize the church possessions, destroy the monasteries, and appropriate to themselves the revenues? Such was the case in Germany, in Holland, in France, in Switzerland, in Scotland, and in England; what a scene of rapine! Let it suffice to say, that in the reign of Henry VIII. were suppressed not less than 645 monasteries, 90 colleges, 110 hospitals, and 2374 chantries and free chapels; (Baker’s Chron.) the lands, &c. of all which were confiscated to the king. Is not this to devour with lions’ teeth? The whole explication here given of the allegory of the locusts, we presume, appears so consonant with the history of the reformation, that the propriety will not be denied. The application is even so obvious, that the learned Protestant divine, Dr. Walton, used it for describing the multitudes of new sectaries that swarmed out of the English Church. Thus he speaks in the preface of his Polyglot: “The bottomless pit seems to have been set open, from whence a smoke has risen, which has darkened the heavens and the stars; and locusts are come out with stings, a numerous race of sectaries and heretics, who have renewed all the ancient heresies, and invented many monstrous opinions of their own. These have filled our cities, villages, camps, houses, nay our pulpits too, and lead the poor deluded people with them to the pit of perdition.” Past. Apoc. ix.  
**10** *And their power was to hurt men five months.* The duration of their power is here limited, but we dare not venture to explain what is meant by the dark expression, five months; time to come must clear up the difficulty. A.  
**13** At the sounding of the sixth trumpet, are said to be loosed the four angels bound in the river Euphrates. By these four angels, and the two hundred millions of horsemen, many understand the devils and their instruments, men incited by them in antichrist’s time, to make war and persecute the Church of Christ, who shall destroy a *third part*, that is, a great part of men then in the world. Divers others apply this to the Persians, the successors of the Parthians, who about the middle of the third age, in the time of Valerian, a great persecutor of the Christians, passed the Euphrates, which used to be the bounds of the Roman empire to the east, defeated, took, and kept Valerian prisoner, which by its consequences gave a great stroke to the Roman empire. See the bishop of Meaux, Pere Alleman, &c. Wi.  
**15** *And the four angels were loosed.* This seems to indicate the moment in which Satan himself is loosed from the abyss or hell, where, as we shall see Apoc. 20:2 he was chained up for a thousand years. This is the time of antichrist, whose coming, as S. Paul says, is according to the working of Satan. 2 Thess. 2:9. The antichristian period is described by the ancient Fathers as the most dreadful of all; and the Apocalypse plainly shews it to be so, as we shall see. But we have this comfort, that his time will be short. He must be loosed a little time. Apoc. 20:3.  
**16** *Twenty thousand times ten thousand*, or two hundred millions. Such an immense multitude cannot be accounted for, but by supposing a great part of it to consist of the infernal beings in human form, as it is doubtful whether there be that number of men capable of bearing arms upon the whole globe of the earth.  
**17** *And thus I saw the horses in the vision.* The horsemen appeared to S. John with breastplates of fire, and of hyacinth, and of brimstone. By this expression is indicated the firing of carabines, or such firearms as cavalry use, which are applied to the breast when shot off. S. John took the fire that issued out of the muskets to come from the horsemen’s breast, on which the muskets rested, and so thought the horsemen had breastplates of fire. The prophet here even describes to us the composition of gunpowder, with its three ingredients, viz. brimstone or sulphur, fire or charcoal, and hyacinth or saltpetre; because saltpetre, when set on fire, emits a flame of a fine purple colour, similar to the colour of the hyacinth stone. Here then we see revealed to S. John both the composition and use of gunpowder, to which he and all mankind at that time were strangers. Then it is said: *And the heads of the horses*, &c. Here is pointed out the artillery of the army, or cannon. He saw in this vision the whole army drawn up at a distance, and the artillery placed upon a line with the cavalry. He seemed to confound the cannon with the horses, and the cannons’ mouths with the mouths of the horses, as the height of both from the ground is nearly the same. He describes the appearances as he saw in the vision, not the reality. When therefore he says, *the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions*, it is the same as if he said, the mouths of the cannon were as to the noise they made, like the mouths of roaring lions. Hence it appears that S. John, in this vision, both saw the fire of the cannon, and heard the explosion.  
**19** *For the power of the horses.* The power of the imagined horses or real cannon, lying in their mouths and in their tails, signifies that the mischievous *power* of the cannon is directed to the object by their *mouths*, but takes its birth in the *tail* or breech of the cannon, where the charge is lodged: whence the cannon’s breech is here compared to the serpent’s head, which contains its venom. Past. hic.  
**20** *The rest of men, who were not slain by these plagues*, which before are metaphorically called *fire, smoke*, and *brimstone*, did not for all that do penance, nor repent of their idolatrous worship of devils, and of idols of gold, silver, &c. nor for their sorceries of magic, nor for their fornication, nor for their thefts. This again may be either understood of what shall happen hereafter, a little before the end of the world (see a Lapide); or perhaps of the Roman heathen idolaters, who still persisted in their iniquitous practices. Dr. Hammond expounds it of the Gnostic heretics. But to apply it to popish Christians, is a groundless invention of the late pretended reformers, neither supported by any authority or reason; (though Dr. W. is pleased to join with them) whereas all Catholics (and as he calls them, papists) have constantly declared in their controversies, in all their catechisms, that they adore none but God alone. Of this more hereafter. Wi.

## Chapter 10

**1** *I saw another mighty Angel.* Some expound it of Christ himself: others of an Angel, representing the power of God over the sea and land. Wi.  
**3** *Seven thunders uttered their v* *oice*, to signify the following approaching evils, which S. John is ordered not to write down, though they were shewn to him; and if he was not to write them, even in such a mystical and prophetical manner as he wrote the other things, who can pretend to know any thing of them? Wi.  
**4** *And when the seven thunders had*, &c. S. John is not permitted to write, but ordered to seal up the things which the seven thunders had spoken; which circumstance seems to insinuate, that the things spoken by the seven thunders were seven particulars of antichrist’s persecution, as the word thunder is generally used in the Apocalypse to denote some disaster; and these seven particulars being most dreadful and severe, the Almighty chose to have them sealed up, or kept concealed, lest the foreknowledge of them should too much terrify and damp the human mind.  
**5** **Ver.** **5–6** **.** *The Angel … swore … that time shall be no longer.* This seems to favour very much the exposition of those interpreters who think that all these things are not to be fulfilled till some short time before the end of the world. Others (of which see Alcazar, &c.) take this to be a prediction of the ruin and destruction of the Jews, particularly under the emperor Adrian. Others (see the bishop of Meaux) understand by this, that the time was approaching when God, by his judgments, would put an end to the idolatry and heathen worship of pagan Rome, and that his providence would make the Christian faith triumph over all its adversaries, and his Church flourish, as foretold by the ancient prophets; that is, this should come to pass when the seventh Angel should sound his trumpet. Wi.  
**7** *Declared.* Lit. *evangelized*, to signify the *good tidings*, agreeable to the gospel, of the final victory of Christ, and of that eternal life which should be the reward of the temporal sufferings of the servants of God. Ch.  
**9** **Ver.** **9–10** **.** *Take the book, and devour it.* See Ezech. 2 and 3. It was sweet in my mouth; I was delighted to read and hear the victories and glory of God’s faithful servants; but it became bitter in my belly, when I considered the judgments of God upon so many sinners, who by their own wilful blindness were lost for eternity. Wi.—This mysterious book, presented to S. John precisely between the sound of the sixth and seventh trumpet, or rather between the irruption announced at the sound of the sixth trumpet, and the persecution which is then to follow and to precede the sound of the seventh trumpet, appears to represent the book of the gospel, which shall be given to the Jews at the end of the sixth age of the Church. This book will be then to them full of sweetness, because they will see in it the tender love of Jesus Christ; but at the same time it will cause bitterness, because they will see in it with grief their infidelity and that of their fathers. V.  
**11** *Thou must prophesy again:* we may understand what still follows in this Apocalypse, or his gospel written afterwards, or his preaching and instructing the Asiatic Churches. Wi.

## Chapter 11

**1** The apostle is ordered to measure the temple. Two prophets are promised, to teach mankind. They are put to death, and in three days and a half after they are raised to life, and ascend to heaven. A great earthquake follows. The seventh Angel sounds the trumpet. The elders give thanks to God.—*Measure the temple*, &c. This is to signify that the divine Providence would always protect his faithful servants, who are called the temple of God; (1 Cor. 3:17 and 2 Cor. 6:16) but by the *outward court* not to be measured, *because it is given to the Gentiles*, &c. (v. 2) is commonly understood idolaters, infidels, heretics, who are not in the temple of God, nor in his Church. It is an allusion to the Jewish temple, and the different divisions of it, the Gentiles not being permitted to enter into the temple itself, but only into that outward part called the court of the Gentiles. Wi.—The churches consecrated to the true God, are so much diminished in number, that they are represented by S. John as one church; its ministers officiate at *one altar;* and all the true faithful are so few, with respect to the bulk of mankind, that the evangelist sees them assembled in one temple, to pay their adorations to the Most High. Pastorini.  
**2** *The holy city they shall tread under foot forty-two months.* [1] That is, Gentiles and Jews shall be permitted to persecute the Church and the faithful servants of God; but only for a short time, expressed by *forty-two months*, as elsewhere by *twelve hundred and sixty days*, and also by *a time*, and *times*, and *half a time*, which, as S. Jerom observes, is for a year, and two years, and half a year, which three different ways of speaking by years, by months, and by days, are only to signify that God never permits his faithful to be under any violent persecution for any long time. Wi.  
**3** *My two witnesses.… shall prophesy twelve hundred and sixty days.* It is a very common interpretation, that by these two witnesses must be understood Henoch and Elias, who are to come before the end of the world. It is true this is what we read in several of the ancient Fathers, insomuch, that Dr. Wells, in his paraphrase, calls it the “consent of the primitive fathers,” and in his notes says, it is of “unexceptionable authority.” This opinion (at least as to Elias) is grounded on those words of the prophet Malachy, (C. 4:5) *behold, I will sen* *d you Elias, the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord;* and also on the words of our Saviour, Christ, (Matt. 17:11) where he tells his disciples: *Elias indeed shall come* *, and restore all things.* But I cannot say that the consent of the fathers is so unanimous as to Henoch: for we find by S. Hilary, that some thought Jeremy was to come with Elias, and he himself thought that with Elias would come Moses. See his commentary on Matt. p. 710, Nov. edit. Secondly, allowing it a received opinion that Henoch and Elias are again to come before the day of judgment, yet it is not the constant doctrine of the ancient fathers, that by these *two witnesses* in this place of the Apocalypse, must be understood Henoch and Elias. S. Cyprian expounds it of two sorts of martyrs for the Catholic faith; to wit, they who suffer death, and others who only suffered imprisonment, loss of goods, and the like. Others expound it of the testimonies concerning Christ and his Church, of which some are in the Old Testament, some in the New. To these we must join all those interpreters who expound all the visions and predictions in the Apocalypse, till the 20th chapter, of the persecutions raised by the Jews: or by the heathens against the Church, which have already happened. Of these, both as to ancient fathers and later interpreters, see Alcazar in his Prologomena, note 6, p. 33, and note 12, p. 48. Wi.—*Two witnesses.* It is commonly understood of Henoch and Elias. Ch.  
**4** *These are the two olive-trees*, flourishing with works of piety and mercy, *and the two candlesticks* shining with faith and good works. Wi.  
**5** *And if any man would hurt them*, &c. These two verses seem to signify both the miracles which God many times wrought by the prayers of his martyrs, as he had done formerly in the time of Elias, and the exemplary punishments with which from time to time he chastised those by whom they were persecuted, and that he will do the like by Henoch and Elias, when they shall come. Wi.—In this and the following verse are expressed the miraculous powers with which the two witnesses will be invested. These powers will be necessary to enable them to prove the truth of their doctrine. Every messenger who appears with a commission from God, is always furnished with means to prove it. Thus our Saviour and his apostles worked miracles in testimony of the Christian religion. And in the Old Testament, Elias convicted the false prophets by a miracle. See 3 K. 18. Every new teacher consequently, who comes destitute of this sanction, can claim no credit, but is only to be considered as an imposter. Past.  
**7** *The beast*, &c. God, for the greater good and glory of his servants, permits the devil by antichrist, and such like instruments, to torment them, and put them to death; and yet by dying they conquer, to the eternal confusion of their persecutors, who shall behold them going up to heaven, to be there happy with God in his kingdom for ever. Wi.—Antichrist, impelled by Satan, shall kill them. Past.  
**8** *Their bodies shall lie in the streets.* It is what has often happened to the bodies of the martyrs, and may happen to Henoch and Elias, *for three d* *ays and a half*, for a short time.—*The great city.* Some understand any city where Christians are persecuted. Others by the following words, *where also their Lord was crucified*, will needs have to be understood Jerusalem, which they hold shall be rebuilt in the time of antichrist, and where by him shall be put to death Henoch and Elias. But others think it may be expounded of heathen Rome, which in a mystical sense might be called *Sodom* for its infamous crimes, and *Egypt* for its idolatries and superstitions, where Christ might be said to be *crucified*, not as to himself, but in his members, according to what he himself said, Mat. 25:40. “inasmuch as you did it to one of these, my least brethren, you did it to me.” Wi.—*City;* Jerusalem, which it is supposed will be the residence of antichrist, and filled with a great concourse of people. Menochius.  
**10** *The inhabitants of the earth shall rejoice*, &c. The persecutors rejoice and make merry for a while, when they seem to get the better of the Christians. Dioclesian caused pillars to be erected to him, as if he had destroyed the Christian religion; and when, by his cruelties he saw the faith of Christ, still increase more and more, he fell into a kind of madness, and laid down his empire. See Baron. ad an. Dni. 304, p. 771. Wi.  
**11** *The spirit of life from God entered into them*, &c. It is an allusion to a vision in the prophet Ezechiel, c. 37. Wi.  
**13** *A great earthquake.* By which may be signified the consternation that fell upon the persecutors of Christians, when by God’s visible chastisements, *seven thousand* (i.e. many of them) perished miserably; others were struck with fear, others converted. Wi.  
**14** These visions belonged to the second wo, and the third wo is at hand. Wi.—*Second wo;* the persecution of antichrist.—*Third wo*, or the day of judgment, is near at hand. Past.  
**15** *The seventh Angel*, &c. The saints and blessed spirits in heaven are represented praising God with loud voices, at the approaching of the kingdom of God; some understand at the end and consummation of the wicked world, after the destruction of antichrist, when the blessed shall reign in heaven: but others expound this of the triumph of the Christian faith and Church, when the providence of God putting an end to the persecutions against the Christian religion, by the miserable end of Dioclesian, Maximian, Maxentius, &c., made *the kingdom of this world* (the powerful Roman empire) become the kingdom of our Lord, by his raising Constantine the great to the empire, and under him making the faith of Christ triumph over all its persecutors and adversaries. Wi.  
**19** *The temple of God was opened … the ark of his testament was seen;* which P. Alleman applies to the cross that appeared in the air to Constantine. Such applications may be probable, but cannot be called certain. Wi.

## Chapter 12

**1** *A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet.* By this woman, interpreters commonly understand the Church of Christ, shining with the light of faith, under the protection of the sun of justice, Jesus Christ. The *moon*, the Church, hath all changeable things of this world *under her feet*, the affections of the faithful being raised above them all.—*A woman:* the Church of God. It may also, by allusion, be applied to our blessed Lady. The Church is clothed with the sun, that is, with Christ: she hath the moon, that is, the changeable things of the world, under her feet; and the twelve stars with which she is crowned, are the twelve apostles: she is in labour and pain, whilst she brings forth her children, and Christ in them, in the midst of afflictions and persecutions. Ch.—Under the figure of a woman and of a dragon, are represented the various attempts of Satan to undermine the Church.—*On her head … twelve stars*, her doctrine being delivered by the twelve apostles and their successors. Wi.  
**2** *With child*, &c. to signify that the Church, even in the time of persecutions, brought forth children to Christ. Wi.—It likewise signifies the difficulties which obstructed the first propagation of Christianity. Past.  
**3** *Another wonder in heaven;* that is, in the Church of Christ, though revealed to S. John, in the visions, as if they were seen in heaven.—*A great red dragon*; a fiery dragon, with *seven heads and ten horns*; i.e. many heads and many horns. By the dragon is generally understood the devil, (see v. 7 and 9) and by the heads and horns, kings and princes, who act under him, persecuting the servants of God. Wi.—*Dragon*, &c. the devil; and by the seven heads and ten horns, are meant those princes and governors who persecute the Church of Christ. Calmet.  
**4** *His tail drew the third part of the stars:* a great part of mankind. This is spoken with an allusion to the fall of Lucifer from heaven, with the rebellious angels, driven from thence by S. Michael. Wi.—According to Pastorini, this passage refers to the angels whom Lucifer drew after him by sin to the earth. Menochius interprets it of those bishops and eminent persons who fell under the weight of persecution, and apostatized.—*And the dragon stood before the woman*, &c. The devil is always ready, as far as God permits him, to make war against the Church and the faithful servants of God. The woman, the Church, brought *a man child*, or rather many men children, stout and valiant in the profession of the true faith, able to resist and triumph over the attempts of the persecutors in all nations, not of themselves, but by the grace and power of Jesus Christ, their protector, who is able to rule all nations as it were with a rod of iron, to frustrate all their attempts, and turn their hearts as he pleaseth. Wi.  
**5** *A man child;* that is, a masculine race of Christians, willing to confess the name of the Lord, and *to fight his battles;* who, through the merits of Jesus Christ, should triumph over all the attempts of the world. Calmet.—*Her son* (or children) *was taken up to* heaven, guarded by the special favour of God. They always overcome the devil, and all their adversaries, by reason of *the blood of the Lamb*, by the merits of Christ. And they loved not the life of the body, so as to preserve it, by incurring the death of the soul. Wi.  
**6** *The woman fled* *into the wilderness.* The Church, in the times of persecutions, must be content to serve God in a private manner; but by divine Providence, such persecutions never lasted with violence only for a short time, signified by 1260 days, or as the same is expressed here, (v. 14) *for a time, and times, and half a time*, i.e. for a year, and two years, and half a year. Wi.—The Christians were accustomed to fly during the times of persecution into the deserts, to avoid the fury of the pagans. This was done by the greatest saints; and S. Jerom remarks, that it was this which gave rise to the eremitical state of life.  
**10** **Ver.** **10–12** **.** *Now is come salvation … rejoice, O ye heavens.* The blessed in heaven rejoice for the victories of the faithful on earth, and also for the reward and glory which would shortly be given them in heaven. Wi.—*Wo to the earth*, &c. Both Pastorini and Calmet refer this wo to the persecution of Dioclesian. The dragon, the devil, is more irritated than ever against the Christians; he therefore stimulates the pagans to exercise their utmost cruelty against them, knowing that a Christian emperor (Constantine) would in a short time extend the reign of Jesus Christ over the whole world.  
**14** *There were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle.* By these two wings, some understand the love of God, and the fear of offending him; others, piety, prudence, &c. Wi.—The Church, on account of the severe pressure of the persecution, obtained from the Almighty a special protection and assistance. Past.  
**15** *The serpent* (the dragon, the devil) *came out of his mouth*, &c. He endeavoured to destroy the Christian religion; but the *earth*, that is, the princes of the earth, as God was pleased to turn their hearts, helped to turn away the persecutions. Wi.—As a last effort, the devil raises a more bloody persecution than was ever known before. See Euseb. Hist. Eccles.  
**16** *And the earth helped the woman.* A prince of the earth, Constantine, came to the succour of the Church, and caused the persecution to cease.  
**18** *And he stood upon the sand of the sea;* [1] i.e. the dragon seemed to be at a stand, to rest a while, not being able to raise any more persecutions. Now as to the time that these things should come to pass, many by seven heads and ten horns understand many powerful wicked kings, who should persecute the good, especially about antichrist’s time, when the faithful at different times should be oppressed, and forced to fly as it were into the wilderness to worship God in private. And when the end of the world seems to draw near, the devil with greater malice will persecute God’s servants, his time being short. Others apply these predictions to the particular persecutions in the Church by the Jews, and by the heathen emperors in the first three Christian ages before Constantine’s time, when idolatry was destroyed, when the face of the Church was changed, and when she became victorious, and publicly triumphed over her former enemies, the heathens; and by the man child, whom God took under his special protection, they will have to be understood Constantine himself. Wi.

## Chapter 13

**1** *I saw a beast coming out of the sea.* By this first boast several understand antichrist, as S. Iren. l. v. c. xxviii. and S. Greg. l. xxxi. Moral. c. xli. But this is not certain. By the *other beast* [1] *coming up out of the earth*, (v. 11) many understand antichrist’s false prophet, some famous impostor and magician in antichrist’s time, who will do great wonders and signs. The *seven heads and ten horns*, may again signify a great number of kings and princes, who shall be overcome by antichrist, and submit themselves to him. The *dragon*, or devil, gives that great power to antichrist, signified by the different parts of the beast, some like to a *leopard*, others to a *bear*, and others to a *lion.* The head *wounded to death* and cured, is either antichrist himself or some one of those heads or kings, cured by the devil and diabolical arts after a mortal wound. Wi.—This first beast, with seven heads and ten horns, is probably the whole company of infidels, enemies and persecutors of the people of God, from the beginning to the end of the world. The seven heads are seven kings, that is, seven principal kingdoms or empires; which have exercised, or shall exercise, tyrannical power over the people of God: of these, five were then fallen, viz. the Egyptian, Assyrian, Chaldean, Persian, and Grecian monarchies: one was present, viz. the empire of Rome: and the seventh and the chiefest was to come, viz. the great antichrist and his empire. The ten horns may be understood of ten lesser persecutors. Ch.  
**2** M. Bossuet, bishop of Meaux, observes in the emperors Maximian Herculeus, Galerius Maximin, and Dioclesian, the distinguishing characters of these three animals. The leopard represents Maximian, a changeable, restless and cruel prince. The bear figures Galerius Maximin, a man from the north of cruel and brutal disposition, terrible mein, and gigantic stature. Lactantius moreover informs us, that he took a pleasure in feeding bears, which bore so great a resemblance to him in size and brutality. The lion, in fine, is the symbol of Dioclesian, who was cruel and vehement against Christians. Calmet.—The whole of this is by Pastorini applied to the empire of Rome, which was composed of the territories of the three preceding empires, which are represented by Daniel under the figure of these animals. And as the body of the beast was like to a leopard, the centre and capital of the Roman empire, under antichrist will be the Grecian empire, denoted by the leopard, of which Constantinople became the capital. Various interpreters explain the whole of this vision by different ways. A.  
**3** *One of his heads*, &c. Some understand this of the mortal wound which the idolatry of the Roman empire (signified by the sixth head) received from Constantine; which was as it were healed again by Julian the apostate. Ch.  
**4** *They adored the dragon;* i.e. in antichrist’s time, they will adore both antichrist and the devil, who will make war against the saints for forty-two months, i.e. a short time, signified also by 1260 days, and by three years and a half. Wi.  
**6** *His tabernacle*, &c. That is, his Church, and his saints. Ch.  
**8** *Slain from the beg* *inning.* In the foreknowledge of God; and in as much as all mercy and grace, from the beginning, were given in view of his death and passion. Ch.  
**10** *Here is the patience*, &c. Here is the motive of the patience and the faith of the saints, or the servants of God in this world. By *faith* they rely on the promises of God for the reward of their *patience*, and leave him to vindicate as he may judge fit their cause with respect to their persecutors. Past.  
**11** *I saw another* [2] *beast*, &c. He had two horns like those of the Lamb, pretending to imitate Christ by an outward sanctity, and by working strange things. Wi.—This second beast with two horns may be understood of the heathenish priests and magicians, the principal promoters both of idolatry and persecution. Ch.  
**12** *He executed a* *ll the power of the former beast in his sight*, or before him, doing great wonders, as Christ foretold should be done by false prophets, (Mat. 24:24) making even fire by lightning come from heaven, as the devil was permitted to do in the time of Job. C. 1.—*He caused* men *to adore the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed*, and the image of the first beast, of antichrist, to be adored, and that no one should buy or sell any thing, unless he had on his forehead or on his arm, some particular mark, called the *character* of this false Christ, or antichrist; or his name, or the number of his name, that is, his name which was made up of numeral letters, 666; but as S. Irenæus thinks, in Greek letters or characters, as S. John wrote his Revelation in Greek. According to the application made by the bishop of Meaux, &c. by the first beast with seven horns were signified the cruel persecutors of the Church, Dioclesian and other six persecuting emperors, to wit, Maximian Herculeus, Galerius Maximian, Constantius Chlorus (father to Constantine), Maxentius, Maximinus, and Licinius. These they look upon to have been the seven heads of the first beast, and by this beast they understand the idolatry of the heathen Roman empire; and by the *ten horns*, a great many barbarous nations, who in their time made irruptions and pillaged the empire, and afterwards brought destruction upon the whole Roman empire, to wit, the Goths, Vandals, and the rest. The resemblances of a leopard, bear, and lion, are introduced with an allusion to what is written by the prophet Daniel, (C. 7) meaning the four great empires: by the leopard, that of the Chaldeans; by the bear, that of the Persians; by the lion, that of the Grecians and of Alexander the great; lastly, that of the Romans, which is not represented by any one beast, but as a compound of others. When it is said that the beast had received a mortal wound, and was *cured again*, these interpreters understand the idolatry of the empire, which was in a great measure destroyed by Constantine, but which was again revived and renewed by Julian the apostate. He might well be said to have a *mouth speaking great things and blasphemies;* but his power lasted only for a short time, signified by forty-two months, though literally he did not reign so long. By the *other beast*, (v. 11) these interpreters, as also Dr. Hammond, understand the philosophers and magicians, with their auguries and pretended oracles of the heathen gods. For these men, under Dioclesian, and particularly under Julian, were constantly exciting the emperors and the people against the Christians, telling them that the gods required that the religion of the Christians should be utterly destroyed. We find in the histories of those times, that an *image* or statue was erected to Julian, together with Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury, and orders given to put to death all those who refused to adore that image. See S. Greg. Naz. Orat. 3. cont. Julianum, and Sozomen, l. v. Hist. c. xvii. Under Dioclesian, and also under Julian, meats offered to idols, were thrown into fountains; and waters consecrated to idols, were sprinkled upon all things to be sold in the market, to the end that the Christians might be defiled by every thing that they bought or eat. As to the number of the name of the beast, 666, in these Greek letters, χξς, nothing can be produced but mere conjecture. S. Irenæus [3] (l. v. c. xxx. p. 371. Ed. Feuardentii) says, that according to the testimony of those who had seen S. John, the number of the beast was to be computed by Greek letters. He takes notice that this number of 666 may be found in several names. He produces some examples, and amongst others the word Lateinos; of which he says, it may seem very likely that this is the name, because the last of the four empires, which were spoken of by the prophet Daniel, was then extant, and had this name of the empire of the Latins. Take notice, that he has not a word that hints at the Latin Church, as some of the late pretended reformation would insinuate. But, says he, the word Teitan carries with it a greater probability. Yet, he concludes, that such expositions are uncertain, and he will not venture to say that this will be the name. The bishop of Meaux proposes, DIoCLesAVgVstVs: but this is to look for it in Latin letters. Others have produced other names. Such fancies and conjectures seem full as well omitted. Wi.  
**18** *Six hundred sixty-six.* The numeral letters of his name shall make up this number. Ch.

## Chapter 14

**1** *Behold a Lamb*, by which is divers times represented our Saviour Christ. Wi.  
**3** *They sung as it were a new canticle.* In these visions, after persecutions, are sometimes introduced rejoicings to encourage the servants of God in their sufferings from the wicked world.—*No man could say* (or sing) *the canticle, but those hundred and forty-four thousand*: by which are signified the elect, *who were not defiled with women.* Some expound this literally of those who always lived virgins; others understand all those who lived or died with a pure and clean heart, exempt from the corruption of vices, and of whom it is said, (v. 5) that *in their mouth was found no lie*, and that they were without spot for the throne of God. Wi.  
**4** *These are they*, &c. In the style of the prophets, by fornication is meant idolatry, and virginity signifies cleanness from all sacrilegious worship. These, therefore, are virgins in this sense, who have not fallen into the impurities of creature worship. But others, as S. Augustine, understand it of persons who have lived in continency. The first, however, is the more literal sense. Calmet.  
**6** **Ver.** **6–7** **.** *Another Angel, … saying: … Fear the Lord.* [1] By this Angel are represented the preachers of the gospel, exhorting all men to the true faith and a good life. Wi.  
**8** *Another Angel, … saying: … She is fallen, she is fallen, that great Baby* *lon.* By Babylon, as observed before, may very probably be signified all the wicked world in general, whom God will punish and destroy after the short time of this mortal life: or may be signified every great city, and perhaps Rome returned to idolatry in the time of antichrist, a little before the end of the world, or may be signified the idolatry of heathen Rome, in the fourth age, when the Christian religion, under Constantine and his successors, began to triumph over paganism, i.e. according to those interpreters followed by Alcazar, Bossuet, P. Alleman, &c. which exposition Dr. Hammond thus expresseth: “the whole impure city of heathen Rome, under the title of Babylon, that old idolatrous city that had lain so heavy upon the people of God … should speedily be destroyed, for advancing the heathen worship.” Wi.—It is probable that here by the great Babylon is meant the city of the devil; that is, the universal society of the wicked: as Jerusalem is taken for the city and the Church of God. Ch.  
**9** **Ver.** **9–10** **.** *The third Angel followed … if any man shall adore the beast, … he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mingled with pure wine*, &c. That is, he shall drink of the bitter cup of God’s indignation, not mixed with water, or any thing to diminish its force, but with wine and wine; i.e. with punishments upon punishments for ever and ever. Wi.  
**12** *Here is* *the patience of the saints.* Here patience is necessary, so as not to be carried away with such pleasures and vanities as are offered in the wicked Babylon, and to remain firm under persecutions with the pious inhabitants of Jerusalem. Wi.  
**13** *Blessed are the dead* (all the dead) *who die in the Lord*, and not the martyrs only, for their works follow every one. Wi.—It is understood of the martyrs, who die for the Lord. Ch.—*For their works follow them*. It is just that they rest at length from their labours, and enjoy for eternity the recompense of their fidelity. They land on the shores of their native country, enriched with the treasures of the good works they have done in this lower world. This is said in express contradiction to those who denied the necessity of good works, and maintained the indifference of actions. This seems to have been the doctrine of the Nicolaites and other heretics of those times. Calmet.—The Holy Ghost confirms the sentence of their happiness, not only because at the moment of their departure their hard labours and penitential works cease, but their souls are admitted to a glorious immortality, the recompense of their good works. Past.  
**14** **Ver.** **14–20** **.** *Like* *to the Son of man.* That is, to our Saviour Christ, sitting on a white cloud, with a crown of gold, and in his hand a sharp sickle. And another Angel, desiring of him to do justice, by putting in his sickle, because the harvest of the earth was ripe, dry, and withered; i.e. the wicked, ripe for punishment. The like is again represented by the sickle, which is said to be put to the clusters of the vineyard: and they were cast into the great wine-press, or lake of the wrath of God, into hell, where the blood is said to come out *even up to the horses’ bridles, for a thousand and six hundred furlon* *gs:* a metaphorical way of expressing the exceeding great torments of the wicked in hell. But to pretend from hence to give the just dimensions of hell, is a groundless conjecture; of which see Corn. a Lapide. Wi.

## Chapter 15

**1** *I saw … seven Angels, having the seven last plagues.* Many by these understand chastisements that will fall upon the wicked a little before the end of the world, and so take these plagues and vials that are poured out, in the next chapter, mostly in a literal sense. Others apply them to different calamities that happened to heathen Rome; but the applications are so different, that they serve to convince us how uncertain they are. In the mean time S. John seems to repeat the same things in a different manner, and some times by way of anticipation, as here the saints are introduced rejoicing, in view of that happiness in heaven which is prepared for them. Wi.—Here is a new vision, great and wonderful, seven Angels holding the figurative symbols of seven plagues. They are called the last, because in them is completed the wrath of God, being inflicted on mankind in the last period of the world, the period of Christianity. The first of these scourges takes place shortly after the commencement of the Christian era, and the seventh puts an end to the world. Past.  
**2** *I saw … a sea of glass, mingled with fire:* by which are signified the storms and dangers which they had happily passed: now they are said to be singing the canticle of Moses after he had passed the Red Sea, *Cantemus Domino*, “Let us sing to the Lord,” &c. As Moses was a figure of Christ, and the Israelites of the Christians, so it is now called the canticle of the Lamb. Wi.—By the sea of glass is meant the firmament that makes the floor of heaven, which is here said to be mingled with fire, in allusion to the troubles and persecutions which the faithful, who are standing on this sea, have sustained. The beast that is here mentioned is an allusion to idolatry or heresy. Past.  
**3** *And sin* *ging.* This sea of glass and fire may also represent the sea which Moses passed in leaving Egypt; and the memory of this famous event, in every respect so similar to the deliverance of the saints from the persecutions to which they had been exposed during their lives, affords them the opportunity of singing the canticle of Moses, at the conclusion of which, they join in the praises of the Almighty for their own particular deliverance. Calmet.—*O King of ages.* In the common Greek is now read, O king of saints. Wi.  
**5** *And after these things.* Here the scene changes, and is carried back to the period of time that immediately precedes the seven plagues. This removal of the scene S. John insinuates by the unusual circumlocution, “after these things I beheld,” and looked on the commencement of this scene. The temple opens, and the seven Angels with the seven plagues proceed from the sanctuary to execute the work they are charged with. Past.—One ought not to be surprised to see the good Angels employed in these kinds of offices, as justice is no less an attribute of the Deity than mercy, and therefore equally the object of the ministry of the Angels. Calmet.—*Behold, the temple of the ta* *bernacle … in heaven, was opened.* We have before observed, that these visions were shewn to S. John as it were in a temple in heaven, and with an allusion to the sanctuary and its parts under Moses. The Angels are seen coming out with clean and white linen, and with golden girdles, being an allusion to the habits of the priests in the ancient law. Wi.  
**8** *The temple was filled with smoke*, &c. as in the time of Solomon. 2 Par. 7. Wi.—The vials are given to the Angels by one of the four living creatures, that is, by a prophet, because at that time the effects had not happened, but were to happen in time to come, and are therefore announced by way of prophecy; and the temple was filled with smoke, manifesting first the majesty of God, and secondly his power. Pastorini.

## Chapter 16

**1** *I heard a great voice.* Bossuet explains the pouring out of the seven vials in this manner. The five first he supposes to have taken place under the reign of Valerian and Gallien; the sixth he supposes to have been poured out during the reigns of Valerian, Dioclesian, and Julian; and the seventh under Honorius and the Alani. Bossuet.—All commentators, however, seem to agree that the great city mentioned in the 19th verse, is to be understood of Rome, and that the plagues which are here foretold, are denounced against her. Calmet, Pastorini, &c.—*Go and pour out the seven vi* *als*, &c. According to the exposition followed by the bishop of Meaux, all these seven vials are already past, being punishments and judgments exercised against the heathen emperors, from the time of Valerian even to the time of Julian, at whose death it might be said, (v. 17) *it is done.* Idolatry is destroyed, as to its public worship. Here in particular, by the drying up of the Euphrates, and by the armies of the East, these interpreters understand those of the Persians, who first gave the great shock to the empire in Valerian’s time, and by whom afterwards Julian the apostate was defeated, and killed. By the great Babylon they also understand idolatrous Rome; and by the islands and mountains sunk by earthquakes, they understand the destruction of divers kingdoms. According to another interpretation, (which is very common) all these judgments are to come before the end of the world; and will be in a manner literally executed about antichrist’s time. At the first vial, men shall be struck with ulcers and wounds, not unlike to the sixth plague of Egypt. At the second and third vial, the sea and fountains shall be turned into blood, as in Egypt. At the fourth vial shall be excessive scorching heats, tormenting men, and burning every thing for their use. At the fifth vial darkness, like that of Egypt. At the sixth vial, (v. 12) the Euphrates dried up, to open a passage for the armies from the East, to come and join the forces of antichrist. And the three unclean spirits like frogs, may signify devils sent by the dragon, or chief of the devils, to excite the wicked to all manner of unclean abominations. They are here said to be gathered together in a place called Armagedon, perhaps with an allusion to Mageddon, in the tribe of Manasses, where the two kings of Israel, Ochozias and Josias, perished. 4 Kings 9:21. And they are brought in only to signify a place of great destruction. See also Zach. 12:11. At the seventh vial, a voice, *it is done*, i.e. the reign of the wicked in general, and of antichrist, is at an end. Wi.  
**2** *And the first.* From hence it appears that the first vial was poured out indiscriminately upon the good equally with the wicked. But behold the different consequences that follow: those that have the mark of the beast are afflicted with a sore and grievous wound, which is said in allusion to the madness, fury, and despair with which the wicked were afflicted, whilst S. John’s omitting to say any thing of the just, shews that they bore it with resignation and joy. Calmet.  
**3** *And the second.* On pouring out the vial follows the divine judgment. There appears blood, like that of a dead man. This passage, Pastorini is of opinion alludes to the Arian heresy, which, like blood, flowed in vigorous circulation whilst in health and strength, gradually retarded its motion, as in a dying man, and was at last totally lost and stopped, like the circulation in a dead man. Hence every living soul died in the sea. Pastorini.—Calmet interprets it as a prediction of the calamities which befell the Roman empire, during the invasion of the Persians on the east, and the Goths and other barbarous nations on the west.  
**4** *Upon the rivers.* That is, on the Roman provinces in Italy, and Rome itself. This is the last stroke employed by the Almighty for the total destruction of Rome. The divine judgment being executed, the Angel of the waters, that is, the Angel that presided over the Roman states, cries out, (v. 5, 6) *thou art just*, &c. Pastorini.  
**8** *And the fourth Angel*. Here is the punishment of the Greeks during the siege of Constantinople by the Turks, where the fire engines, that were then made use of for the first time, so reduced the Grecian army, that the walls of the city were reduced to ashes, and the whole town to flames. Hence it appears how the Greeks were scorched with great heat; and how they blasphemed the name of God, appears too evident from the history of Notaros, admiral of the Constantinopolitan fleet. Past.  
**10** Calmet explains this passage of Rome the seat of idolatry, which was given up to the pillage of the barbarians under Alaric. Calmet.  
**12** *River Euphrates.* That is, a passage is laid open for the potentates of the East to lay their destructive hands upon the countries on this side the Euphrates. For they are the spirits of devils working signs, which are sent forth by the eastern princes, to oblige all to unite in arms against the great day of the Almighty God. Pastorini.  
**16** *Armagedon* *.* That is, the hill of robbers. Ch.  
**18** The seventh vial is poured out upon the air which lies between the earth and the heavens, to indicate that the judgments of God are going to fall upon the whole creation. After which follow these words, *it is done.* All is over, time is no more; upon which immediately follow lightnings, &c.  
**19** *Great Babylon came in remembrance before God.* The time of God’s punishing the wicked world is approaching: for by a third interpretation, Babylon may signify metaphorically all the wicked in general. Wi.  
**21** *And great hail like a talent came down*, &c. [1] Which need not be taken literally, but only metaphorically, to signify the heavy weight of God’s judgments upon sinners. Wi.

## Chapter 17

**1** I must repeat what I have already taken notice of, both in the preface to the Apocalypse, and sometimes in the annotations, that there are three ways of expounding all the visions of this revelation, from the end of chap. 3 to the end of ver. 10 chap. 20 all of which seem grounded on the opinions of the ancient Fathers. According to the first, all these visions are only to be fulfilled in antichrist’s time, a little before the end of the world. According to the second, the visions may be applied to particular events, which happened in the first three or four ages, under the persecuting heathens, till by Constantine, and the succeeding Christian emperors, idolatry by degrees was extirpated, and the faith of Christ triumphed over all its enemies, whether Jews or pagans. According to the third, by the great city of Babylon, is mystically and metaphorically signified all wicked great cities in the world, all the multitude of the wicked dispersed in all nations, their short and vain happiness, their persecutions and oppressions of the good and faithful servants of God, who live piously in this world, and who are called to be citizens of the celestial Jerusalem in the kingdom of God, where he reigneth for ever with his Angels and saints, and where they all reign with him, happy in his sight and enjoyment. I am more and more inclined to this third exposition, by reading this 17th chapter, with the contents of the 18th, 19th, and 20th chapters, till the 11th verse, and by reading what S. Jerom says in general terms, in his epistle to Marcella, tom. 4, part 1, p. 166, Nov. edit. “*that all this book* (of the Apocalypse) *is either to be expounded spiritually, or if we follow a carnal interpretation, we must content ourselves with Jewish fables.* And especially by reading what S. Aug. has delivered us upon the chief difficulties of the Apocalypse, in his 20th book de Civ. Dei, from chap. vi. to chap. xvi. and from p. 578. to p. 594. tom. 7. Nov. edit. To expound then these chapters together according to this third interpretation. Wi.—*Of the great harlot.* Nothing can be better applied than this epithet to ancient Rome, which had conquered almost all the kingdoms of the known world, as it is said in ver. 18 she *is the great city, a kingdom which hath dominion over the kings of the earth;* ver. 9 it was built upon *seven mountains*; ver. 6 was watered with the blood of the saints and *martyrs of Jesus* Christ; and in fine, ver. 5 it was the great *Babylon*, as S. Peter, in his first epistle, pleases to call it. Calmet.—*Come, I will shew thee the condemnati* *on of the great harlot, … Babylon … the mother of the fornications*. By this *harlot*, and this *Babylon*, is signified the multitude of all the wicked of all times and places, who have abandoned themselves to sensual pleasures, and sought for their happiness in riches and worldly grandeur; for this reason she is said to carry on her forehead this inscription, *a mystery;* that is, to be understood in a mystical sense of all the wicked, who make up as it were one city, as S. Aug. observes, which may be called *Babylon*, the city of confusion, the city of idolatry, and of all manner of vices.—*The beast*, that is, the devil, carries her, whose suggestions the wicked follow. He comes out from *the bottomless pit. He was*, i.e. had a much greater and more extensive power over the wicked world before Christ’s coming and incarnation; *and he is not*, i.e. according to S. Aug. his power hath been much extenuated and lessened since that time. He is *bound* or chained *up for a thousand years*, as it is said, c. 20:2. By which may be understood all the time from Christ’s coming, and the establishing of his Christian Church, till the last and severest persecution under antichrist. See S. Aug. l. xx. de Civ. Dei. c. vii. And when he shall come again, and be let loose, as it were, in antichrist’s time, he must continue a short while: for all the ancient fathers agree, by the interpretations they give to the Scripture, that antichrist, and consequently the devil with antichrist, must reign but a short time. The *scarlet coloured beast*, the devil, called the prince of this world, on whom the *harlot gilded* *with gold* sat; that is, all the wicked, and particularly all wicked kings and princes, with their worldly greatness, who were *drunk with the wine of her prostitution;* that is, who abandoned themselves and indulged their passions with all sensual pleasures, and contented themselves with the vain and deceitful happiness of this life; to be convinced of which, the Angel is said to have taken S. John *in spirit into a wilderness* from the company of the wicked world, the better to see and contemplate the vanity of their short and false happiness. This *woman*, this *harlot*, this *Babylon*, this multitude of the wicked, especially the heathen persecuting emperors at Rome, and in all other places, (and they who acted against the Christians under them) are said to be *drunk with the blood of the saints,* *and the blood of the martyrs*, by putting the Christians, the Catholics and the servants of God to death, from the foundation of the world to its consummation, by the instigation of the *beast*, the devil. The *beast*, the devil, is represented with *seven heads* and *ten horns;* that is, with many heads and many horns, signified by the numbers *seven* and *ten.* See S. Aug. c. xxiii. p. 606.—*The seven heads*, as it is said, v. 9, are seven mountains, and seven kings, i.e. a great many. And also the *ten horns*, (v. 12) are ten kings. Wi.  
**4** *Cup.… full of the abomination*, &c. These are common scriptural expressions for the abominations of idolatry, with which ancient Rome had notoriously polluted herself. For not content with worshipping her own heathenish gods, she adopted those of all the countries and nations she had subdued. In Rome itself there were no less than 420 heathenish temples, so that one of their most famous poets, Ovid, (lib. i. Trist.) says:  
**5** *A mystery.* That is, a secret, because what follows of the name and title of the great harlot is to be taken in a mystical sense.—*Babylon.* Either the city of the devil in general; or, if this place be to be understood of any particular city, *pagan Rome*, which then and for 300 years persecuted the Church, and was the principal seat both of empire and idolatry. Ch.  
**6** *Drunk with the blood of the saints.* Such was pagan Rome, for innumerable were the *martyrs* she put to death, both throughout the extent of her vast dominions, and even in her own bosom, the city itself. These were the victims of the ten persecutions raised by Rome against the Christians. Such was *the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the marty* *rs of Jesus.* Pastorini.  
**8** *The beast which thou sawest.* This beast, which supports Babylon, may signify the power of the devil; *which was, and is not*, being much limited by the coming of Christ, but shall again exert itself under antichrist. The seven heads of this beast are seven mountains or empires, instruments of his tyranny; of which five were then fallen, as above, chap. 13 ver. 1. The beast itself is said to be *the eighth, and is of the seventh;* because they all act under the devil, and by his instigation, so that his power is in them all, yet so as to make up, as it were, an eighth empire distinct from them all. Ch.  
**9** *Seven mountains*. We have already observed that ancient Rome stood upon seven mountains. The same cannot be said of modern Rome, as some of the hills are not inhabited.—*The seven heads … are seven kings*, or seven Roman emperors, who were particularly distinguished as the chief supporters of idolatry, and the most virulent persecutors of the Christian religion. Their names were Nero, Domitian, Severus, Decius, Valerian, Dioclesian and Antichrist.—*Five* of them *are* fallen or gone, viz. Nero, Domitian, Severus, Decius, Valerian, who supported the idolatrous empire for a time; *one is*, viz. Dioclesian, with whom the reign of idolatry falls; and *the other is not yet come*, that is, antichrist.  
**10** *Five are fallen, one is, and the other is not yet.* The meaning of this is obscure. And perhaps it were better to own with S. Aug. that we do not know the meaning, than to advance suspicions and conjectures. But it is not improbable that by these seven kings may be understood the collection of kings, in what are called the seven ages of the world, from its creations to its consummation. The first age, is reckoned from Adam to Noe, and the deluge: the second age, from Noe to Abraham; the third, from Abraham to Moses; the fourth, from Moses to David; the fifth, from David to Christ. These five were past, and *fallen*, when S. John wrote. The sixth is, and is to last from Christ to antichrist. And another, the seventh, *is not*, being the time of antichrist, and only a short time. See A. Lapide on this verse. Wi.  
**11** *The beast that was, and is* *not:* is *the eighth: and is of the seven.* The devil reigns with the kings in all these ages: he is *of the seven*, because he is the prince under whom reign the wicked in all ages: he is also *the eighth*, inasmuch as he is their prince, and they are only his instruments. Wi.  
**12** *The ten horns*, or ten kings, *which thou sawest*, as yet have received no kingdom, *but shall receive power as kings one* *hour after the beast;* or, as it is in the Greek, with the beast. According to the common interpretation, this must be referred to ten, or many kings, who are different from all the wicked kings that had been, and who should follow and live at the same time with *the beast*, by which here seems to be signified antichrist. Or, if by these ten kings we understand all the wicked kings, who were to come after S. John wrote, to the end of the world, they had not yet kingdoms, but the kingdoms which they should have, and all their vain happiness, would be very short, and at the same time they would be under the beast, and subject to him. Wi.—*Ten horns.* These denote ten kings or ten powers; namely, Goths, Huns, Alans, Vandals, Saxons, Burgundians, Franks, Heruli, Suevi, &c. the chief of the Barbarians that invaded the Roman empire in the fifth century.—They *shall receive power as kings, one hour after the beast*; that is, they will serve under their own leaders, to assist pagan Rome a little against its enemies; and their *one design* is afterwards to take the fruitful provinces of Rome to themselves, which we know they did. Pastorini.—*Ten kings.* Ten lesser kingdoms, enemies also of the Church of Christ; which nevertheless shall be made instruments of the justice of God, for the punishment of Babylon. Some understand this of the Goths, Vandals, Huns, and other barbarous nations that destroyed the empire of Rome. Ch.  
**13** *These have one design*, to make themselves as happy as they can in this world: and their *power they shall* give *to the beast*, being always slaves of the devil. Wi.  
**14** **Ve** **r.** **14** **.** *These shall fight with the Lamb.* Their actions and affections being always led away with the love of this world, which is an enemy to Christ and his doctrine: but *the Lamb*, Christ, *shall overco* *me them*, and punish them, when he pleases: for he, Christ, God and man, *is Lord of lords, and King of kings;* and as S. John says again, (c. 19:16,) has written on his thigh, the *King of kings, and Lor* *d of lords*, to signify to us his divinity, or divine nature. Wi.—All these different people were either heathens or heretics, and of course were bitter enemies to the Catholic religion; *but the Lamb o* *vercame them*, by turning their hearts, and converting them to Christianity.  
**15** **, &c.** *The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth*, signify the different nations, in all which is a multitude of wicked, especially among the great ones of this world. Wi.

## Chapter 18

**2** *Babylon the great is fallen, is f* *allen.* Idolatrous Rome is fallen. That mighty seat of power and dominion is fallen. The long fixed abode of voluptuousness and luxury, for *the merchants of the earth have become rich by the strength o* *f her delicacies*, and now the hand of God hath struck her. It is utterly destroyed; not a human being in it. Thus it is become an accursed place, given up for an *habitation of devils* and a *hold of eve* *ry unclean spirit*, or of frightful spectres and ghosts, and *a hold of every unclean and hateful bird*, of owls, ravens, vultures, &c. &c. Past.  
**4** *Go out from her, my people.* The people of God, the Christians, are all here told to leave the falling city, lest they *be partakers of her sins, and receive of her plagues.* At the time of Alaric’s sacking Rome, many fled away to S. Jerom, who was then in Judea; others fled into other parts, as many holy fathers testify. S. Jerom says, (Ep. vii) that S. Paula and several illustrious Christian families had left Rome as if by particular inspiration, and retired into Judea. The holy pope Innocent was drawn by a particular providence out of the city, as Lot out of Sodom, that he might not see the ruin of a guilty people, says Orosius, lib. 7. c. xxxix. We read likewise that Melania, as if she foresaw the approaching catastrophe, had prevailed upon many Christians to retire with her from a city doomed to destruction. Histor. Laus. c. cxviii. In fine, we all know that when the storm broke out, the Christians took refuge and were saved in the Churches of S. Peter and S. Paul, which Alaric had allowed to be places of safety. A.  
**10** *Alas!* *alas!* S. Aug. informs us, that the people of the eastern provinces, and the remotest cities, mourned in a public manner on this occasion. De Civ. Dei. l. 1, c. xxxiii.  
**13** We see here enumerated the articles of the luxury of the pagan Romans in dress, in ornaments, in furniture, in equipage, in the sumptuousness of their tables, &c. &c. Nothing is more remarkable than the extravagant luxury and profusion of some of the Roman emperors at their tables. Caligula once spent (according to Seneca) for a supper, 150,000 crowns. Suetonius tells us, that the emperor Vitellius would feast himself thrice, and often four times in a day, spending 10,000 crowns at each meal. But now they are all gone; they are now the fuel of fire, and *in one hour brought to nought.* A.  
**20** *Rejoice … heaven*, the *holy apostles and prophets*, and all the holy ministers of the gospel: and holy men are invited here to rejoice, because the divine justice is accomplished in the ruin of that guilty city. Past.—By the words *prophets*, &c. are not meant those of the old law, as pagan Rome had not been the cause of their deaths, but here only includes all the prophets, saints, and martyrs, who had been put to death for Christ throughout the whole Roman empire. A.

## Chapter 19

**1** Here we enter upon a new scene. Babylon the great is fallen. The saints are here represented rejoicing over *the woman* who was *drunk with the blood of the saints.* C. 17:6. Calmet.—*The voice of many multitudes … saying: Alleluia.* In these visions, when the martyrs have triumphed and overcome persecutors, are sometimes represented their praises of God in heaven. Here in the Protestant translation, are retained *Alleluia* and *Amen*, which as S. Aug. takes notice, used not to be changed nor translated in any language. Wi.  
**6** *The voice of a great multitude.* Menochius applies this voice to the multitude of Angels and saints, which from its strength may be compared to the voice of rushing waters, and because of the terror with which it strikes the wicked. Pastorini understands by this *voice of many waters*, the voices of many Angels that preside over the nations, denoted by *waters*, which had all before groaned under the tyranny of antichrist; and the *voice of great thund* *ers*, that of the Angel who presides over fire, which, as employed in military engines, by its explosion resembles thunder. It must be observed that the latter author refers it to the last stage of the world.  
**7** *For the marriage*, &c. In the New Testament, the word marriage points out the establishment of the Church, the vocation of different people to the faith, or the reign of the Messias. Calmet.  
**8** *Fine linen.* The symbol of justifications, or the good works and merit of her holy members; the most pleasing attire in which she can present herself to the Lamb. Her robe is *glittering a* *nd white*, because she has been purified as silver in the furnace, and washed *white* in the waters of tribulation and persecution. Pastorini.—The fine linen, or *byssus*, here mentioned, is, according to Calmet, a kind of silk produced by a shell-fish, called *pinna* *;* though the same learned commentator allows that the Greek authors use this word for *fine linen.*  
**10** *And I fell before his feet, to a* *dore him.* [1] They of the pretended reformation think they have here a clear proof that no veneration is due to Angels and saints, and that papists in so doing are idolaters. In answer to this: First, they make S. John the apostle guilty of that idolatry which they lay to our charge. For they must suppose and grant that S. John, as to the dispositions of his mind and will, was just ready, or rather falling down, did pay an idolatrous worship to the Angel; and what Christian can believe this of so great an apostle, that after he had been favoured with all those extraordinary visions, he should either be so very ignorant as not to know what was idolatry, or so impious as to become guilty of it, and give divine honour to any creature? And what makes S. John altogether inexcusable, (had it been idolatry) we find him doing the very same a second time, in the last chapter of the Apocalypse; (v. 7 and 8) that is, falling *down* at the Angel’s feet to *adore.* Secondly, as it would be extravagantly unreasonable to suspect this apostle, this evangelist, this prophet of the new law, to be guilty of what every Christian, every Jew knows to be idolatry; to wit, to give divine honour due to God alone to any creature whatsoever; so in reason we cannot but conclude that he was not for giving divine honour to any Angel, knowing them all to be God’s creatures. If therefore he was about to pay divine honour, we must either say that he took him who then appeared to him to be our Saviour Christ, God and man, as some expound it; or, which seems more probable, he was only for offering an inferior honour and veneration to the Angel, such as he knew was lawful: and therefore he was for doing it afterwards a second time; though the Angel would not receive it from S. John, to make us the more convinced of the great dignity of this apostle and prophet, who should be raised in heaven to a degree of glory, not inferior to that of the Angels: and thus the Angel tells him, that he is his fellow creature, who with him must adore Almighty God, that by these prophecies they both bear testimony concerning Jesus Christ and his Church, the Angel by revealing them, and S. John by publishing them, which seems to be the sense of the following words, *for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy:* or they may be expounded thus, for the testimony that we give concerning Christ and his Church, we both of us receive from the divine spirit of God, who reveals such truths to his prophets. Thirdly, the Protestants are for proving us idolaters from what S. John was about to do, or rather from what he did, expressed in these words, *and I fell before his feet to adore him;* or, as in the Prot. translation, *and I fell at his feet to worship him.* Now it is certain and evident that these words neither in the Latin nor in the Greek, express that divine worship and honour which is due, and which is given to God alone, whether we consult the Hebrew or the Sept. of the Old Testament, the very same words are many times used to signify no more than an inferior honour given to creatures. This is a thing well known, and agreed upon by every Protestant as well as Catholic, who has read the Scriptures, or who knows any thing of Latin, Greek, or Hebrew. Fourthly, it seems very strange, very unaccountable, that our adversaries will not understand the difference betwixt divine honour due to God alone, and an inferior honour, respect, or veneration given to Angels or saints, to their relics or images, which inferior honour may, in some sense, be called a religious honour, inasmuch as it is paid to persons or things that may be called sacred or holy. Is not honour or veneration certainly different, as the *objects* or things we pay honour to, and the intention of him that pays this honour, are different, though perhaps the exterior marks of bowing, of kneeling, of prostrating, of kissing, may be the same? We honour the king, and we also honour his courtiers, his officers, and such as are invested with dignities and authority from him: but shall any one think that we pay the same honour to all these persons or things belonging to them? though the eastern people kneel or prostrate themselves before kings or persons in dignities, they neither give nor design to give them divine honour. Why will our adversaries pretend to make us idolaters against our wills, minds, and intentions, when we have always protested that we give divine honour and supreme worship to God alone? that we honour, worship, serve and adore him only as the author of all things? that we never design to pay any thing but an inferior honour to the highest Angels or saints, or to their relics and images. We know, believe, and profess that there is an infinite distance betwixt God the creator, and the highest and most perfect of all created beings; so that the honour we give them is infinitely inferior, as they themselves are, to the honour that with our hearts and minds we pay to God: and must it be said that we give divine honour to creatures, and so become idolaters, when we never design it, when we design quite the contrary? This made Mr. Thorndike, in his book of just weights and measures, tell his Protestant brethren, that the Church of Rome cannot be charged with idolatry for their reverencing images, nor on any other account; and so exhorts them not to pretend to lead the people by the nose, to make them believe suppositions which they cannot prove. See C. 2 and 19. Wi.—*Fell before*, &c. S. Athanasius and S. Aug. think S. John took the Angel to be Jesus Christ, and as such was desirous of paying him the supreme homage, or λατρεια. Calmet.—S. John, in token of gratitude, offers to pay to the Angel such homage as is due to a being of his rank, which the Angel however refuses to accept, giving for reason, that his is *a fellow-servant* of the apostle, and of the apostle’s *brethren*, who bear *testimony* to Jesus Christ. Pastorini.—This speech evidently agrees with the character of the Baptist, but not with that of a real Angel.—*Testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.* The testimony which you give to Christ, by suffering for his holy name and the profession of his doctrine, is of equal value with the *spirit of prophecy* which I possess. Past. Calmet.  
**11** *Behold a white horse.* The titles and character given to him that sat on this white horse, shew that hereby was represented Jesus Christ, called also here the *word of God*, v. 13; and v. 16, *and he hath on his garment and on his thigh written: King of kings and Lord of lords*, &c. Wi.—*And he that sat*, &c. The heavens open and S. John sees Jesus Christ, the Son of God, descending, seated on *a white horse.* He is known by the peculiar appellations of *faithful and true.* Faithful, in protecting his servants; and true, by always keeping strictly true whatever he promises. Past.  
**12** *Flame*, &c. Which shews his indignation.—*Diadems;* the mark of power. So Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, after he had entered Antiochia, took two crowns, to signify that he was king of two countries, Syria and Egypt. Pastorini.—*Which* (name) *no man knoweth but himself.* Some interpreters think S. John alludes to an ancient custom which still obtains among the Orientals, of having a secret name, which they discover to no one. Calmet.—Pastorini understands this to be the name of the *word of God*, as mentioned in the subsequent verse; which is so comprehensive in its meaning, that human reason cannot fathom it, *and no man knoweth but himself.*  
**13** *Sprinkled with blood*, &c. Which betokens the carnage made among his enemies.  
**14** *The armie* *s*, &c. The celestial armies of saints follow the Son of God, as their captain and commander; they are all like him, mounted on *white horses*, and clothed in *fine linen, white and clean*, a symbol of their merit and glory. Past.  
**15** *Sharp two-edged sword.* The power which Christ exercises over the impious. Menochius.—*Wine press*, &c. This painting corresponds to the triumph of Jesus Christ. Calmet.—Some of the attributes here mentioned are also ascribed to Christ, by the prophet Isaiah. C. 63:2, 3. “Why then is thy apparel red, and thy garments like theirs that tread in the wine press? I have trodden the wine-press alone, and of the Gentiles there is not a man with me: I have trampled on them in my indignation, and have trodden them down in my wrath, and their blood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my apparel.” Past.  
**17** *An Angel … in the sun, … with a loud voice* invites all the birds of the air to a most plentiful entertainment which is preparing for them, where they may fill themselves with human flesh of all kinds; from that of *kings* to that of *bondmen;* (v. 18) and with the *flesh of horses* and that of *them that sin on them:* an expressive picture of the immense slaughter that is going to be made. It would seem that this bloody scene will terminate in the evening of the day, as the invitation is given to a supper. Past.  
**19** We have just now seen the heavenly captain on horseback, at the head of his holy troop, marching to battle; and now we see who are the enemies he comes to encounter. Here is the beast, or antichrist, with prodigious armies gathered from all parts of the earth, and headed by their kings and princes. Past.  
**20** *The beast*, &c. Antichrist is taken alive. Menochius.

## Chapter 20

**2** *And bound him for a thousand years.* I shall give the reader an abridgment of what S. Augustin has left us on this chapter, in his 20th book de Civ. Dei. From the 5th to the 16th chap. (t. vii. p. 578 et seq.) he treats upon these difficulties: What is meant by the first and second resurrection; by the binding and chaining up of the devil; by the thousand years that the saints reign with Christ; by the first and second death; by Gog and Magog, &c. As to the *first resurrection*, c. 6 he takes notice on the 5th verse, that *resurrection* [1] in the Gospels, and in S. Paul, is applied not only to the body but also to the soul; and the *second resurrection*, which is to come, is that of the bodies: that there is also a *death of the soul*, which is by sin; and that the *second deat* *h* is that of soul and body by eternal damnation: that both bad and good shall rise again in their bodies. On those words, (v. 6) *Blessed is he that hath part in the first resurrection; in these the se* *cond death hath no power.* Such, saith he, (c. 9) as have risen from sin, and have remained in that resurrection of the soul, shall never be liable to the second death, which is damnation. Cap. vii. p. 580, he says that *some Catholics not understanding rightly the first resurrection*, have been led into *ridiculous fables*, [2] and this by the interpretation which they put on the *thousand years;* as if the first resurrection implied *a resurrection of the bodies* of the martyrs and saints, who should live *on the earth with Christ* for a thousand years before the general resurrection, in all *manner of d* *elights.* This was the opinion of those called Millenarians: this, saith he, might seem *tolerable in some measure*, [3] if taken for spiritual delights, (for we ourselves were once in these sentiments) but if for carnal pleasures, it can only be *believed by carnal men*. He then expounds what may be understood by the *binding* and chaining of the devil for a thousand years; (Cap. vii. & viii, p. 581) that the thousand years, meaning a long time, may signify all the time from Christ’s first coming [4] to his second at the end of the world, and to the last short persecution under antichrist. The devil is said to be *bound*, that is, his power much *lessened* and restrained, in comparison of the great and extensive power he had over all nations before Christ’s incarnation; not but that he still tempts many, [5] and raiseth persecutions, which always turn to their greater good; and that towards the end of the world he shall be let loose, as it were, for a short time, and permitted with his infernal spirits to exercise his malice against mankind, to try the patience of the elect, and to shew the power of God’s grace, by which his faithful servants shall triumph over the devil. N.B. What S. Augustine adds divers times in these chapters: “Let no one,” says he, “imagine [6] that even during that short time, there shall be no Church of Christ on the earth: God forbid: even when the devil shall be let loose, he shall not be able to seduce the Church.” Cap. ix, p. 586, he expounds those words, (v. 4–5) *I saw the souls of them that were beheaded … and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand ye* *ars … This is the first resurrection:* i.e. the first resurrection is while the devil is chained up for the space of a thousand years. He takes notice that the *present state of the Church* is many times called *the kingdom of God*, and that the *Church of Christ reigns now with Christ*, both in the living saints and in those who are dead, in the souls of the martyrs, and of others, who having lived and died piously, now reign with Christ, not yet *in their bodies*, [7] *but their souls reign with him.* On those words of the 4th verse: *who had not adored the beast, nor his image, nor received his mark*, he only gives this exposition, as agreeable to the Christian faith, that by the *beast* may be understood the multitude of wicked sinners in general, and the *image of the beast* [8] those who are of the Church in outward appearance and profession only, and not by their works. When it is said (v. 5) that the *rest of the dead lived not till the thousand years were finished:* they lived not, says he, as to their souls, when they should have lived; and therefore not being happy in heaven, when their *bodies shall rise, it shall not be to life, but to judgment and damnation, which is the second death*. Cap. xi, he expounds the 7th and 8th verses, where it is said that Satan *shall be loosed … and seduce the nations which are over the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog*, [9] *and shall gather them tog* *ether to battle*. This, says S. Aug. will be *the last persecution* at the approach of the day of judgment, which the whole city, or the whole Church of Christ dispersed through the universe, will suffer from the whole city of the devil. Neither need Gog and Magog be taken for a particular [10] barbarous people, but such as are dispersed in a manner in every nation, and who shall then break out by the instigation of Satan into an open hatred and persecution against the faithful servants of God; as it is said, (v. 8) *they ascended upon the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints*, where we cannot literally understand one camp, one city, or one place, but the Church every where dispersed. Cap. xii, he expounds the 9th verse, where he takes *fire* to signify, metaphorically, *the* *firm resistance* and constancy of the good, and the *fire* [11] of their zeal, which devoured as it were the wicked; or we may understand with others, the temporal *fire* of God’s judgments in this world against the wicked, but not the last eternal fire; because the eternal fire comes *not down from heaven* but the wicked are cast into it below. Cap. xiii, he teacheth that the last persecution [12] of antichrist, here mentioned, shall last but three years and six months; i.e. a little while. Cap. xiv and xv, he expounds the 10th and following verse, of the devil being cast into the lake of fire, after the last persecution of antichrist. By *the beast* he understands, as before, the city or multitude of all the wicked; and by the *false prophet*, either antichrist or the outward appearance of faith in them that have none. Then follows the last judgment, where it is said that *the books are opened*, and also that *another book was opened.* By the first book, may be understood men and their consciences; and by the *other book, the book of life*, that [13] *of eternal predestination.* Thus far S. Augustine, where we see that he delivers the common Catholic doctrine, that by the thousand years, so often mentioned in this chapter, he understands all that time in which the souls of the martyrs, and of all other saints, reign happy with Christ in heaven, till after the general resurrection they receive a full and complete happiness, both as to soul and body. A false exposition of these *thousand years* gave occasion to the mistake, the error, and heresy of those called the Millenarians, which Mede and Dr. W. have followed. Papias, who lived soon after, or perhaps with S. John, was the chief promoter of this mistake; a man, says Eusebius, of “little judgment and capacity,” [14] who misconstrued the discourses which he heard. He was followed by divers writers in the second, third, and fourth century, who did not hold with Cerinthus and his followers, that the saints should rise before the general resurrection, and reign with Christ on earth for a thousand years in all manner of *sensual pleasures;* but in *spiritual delights*, in the city of Jerusalem, built anew after that glorious manner described in the next chapter. Now though this opinion had several considerable abettors, of which I find these seven: Papias, S. Justin, S. Irenæus, Tertullian, Nepos, (a bishop, in Egypt; in Euseb. l. vii. c. xxiv) Victorinus Petabionensis, Lactantius, and Severus Sulpitius: yet were there always other learned Catholic writers who rejected it as a fable. Of this number was Caius, a priest, at Rome, about the end of the second age; Origen, in his prologue on the Canticles; S. Denys, of Alexandria, who in the third age wrote to confute Nepos; (see Euseb. l. vii. hist. c. xxiv. who treats it as *a fable*) S. Basil, [15] who calls it an *old wife’s tale*, and a Jewish fiction, Epist. 293; S. Greg. Naz. Orat. 52; S. Epiphan. S. Jerom, Philastrius, Theodoret, who place this opinion among the heresies and heretical fables: so that this could never be looked upon as the constant doctrine and tradition of the Church. The bishop of Meaux takes notice, that Mede either mistook or falsified the text of S. Justin, [16] who, in his Dialogue with Tryphon, holds that opinion of a *thousand years reign;* but adds, “I also told you, that many who are Christians of pious and sound sentiments, do not own this to be true.” Thus we read in the Greek, as well as in the Latin translation: but Mr. Mede quite changes the sense, by adding a negative in this manner; *but many who are* not *of this pure and holy doctrine*, &c. We may observe that S. Justin says in the next page, that they who own not the resurrection of the body, and say that souls go to heaven without any future resurrection, are not to be accounted Christians, but are to be looked upon as Sadducees and unbelievers. Which is very true. And he adds, that he, and others who *think right* with him, know that there will be a resurrection of the flesh, and a rebuilding of Jerusalem for a thousand years, which S. Justin himself judged grounded on the prophets, Isaias, Ezechiel, &c. So that not to make S. Justin contradict himself, he mentions three opinions: the first is the heresy of those who absolutely denied the future resurrection of the dead: these were not Christians, but unbelievers, Sadducees, &c. The second was of those who held that the martyrs and saints should rise, and reign for a thousand years in their bodies on the earth; this, which was his own opinion, he calls *the right and true doctrine.* But thirdly, he does not condemn those pious Christians who, as he had said before, disowned this thousand years reign, for this would be to contradict himself. Wi.—In the above chapter, what man can reflect without trembling, that the devil has the rage of a dragon, the cunning of an old serpent, the malice of a calumniator, and that he is a most implacable enemy? On the other hand, what man is there that does not feel consolation in the reflection, that Jesus Christ has vanquished this savage fiend, and bound him in fetters, by limiting the exercise of his rage and malice? Some understand this chaining of the dragon of the reign of Constantine, and particularly after the defeat of Licinius; (see sup. c. 12:18) and the thousand years of the intermediate period between Constantine and antichrist, when the devil will again be let loose, but for a short time, only three years and a half. V.—*Bound him*, &c. The power of Satan has been very much abridged by the passion of Christ; for a thousand years; that is for the whole time of the new testament, but especially from the time of the destruction of Babylon or pagan Rome, till the new efforts of Gog and Magog against the Church, towards the end of the world. During which time the souls of the martyrs and saints live and reign with Christ in heaven, in the first resurrection, which is that of the soul to the life of glory, as the second resurrection will be that of the body, at the day of general judgment.

## Chapter 21

**1** *New*, by their form and qualities, but not by their substance.—*The first heaven and first earth was passed away:* being changed, not as to their substance, but in their qualities. Ch.  
**2** *Coming down from God out of heaven.* By the city we must understand its citizens, the Angels and saints. Wi.—Justice, innocence, the good works of the saints, are the ornaments of the inhabitants of this new Jerusalem, the Church triumphant. If the world of the old Adam has appeared so beautiful, so magnificent, good God, what will be the riches of that which is made for Jesus Christ, the second Adam, and for his members! O Jesus! Father of the world to come, render us worthy of this new and everlasting world, and give us a disgust, a mortal hatred, for that which perishes, and which is the cause of our perdition.  
**3** *Behold the tabernacle of God with men*, inasmuch as God’s elect shall there dwell with him for ever and ever. Wi.  
**6** *It is done.* The state of Christ’s Church on earth, and in this world, is now finished; and the time is come to reward the good, and to punish the wicked in the lake burning with fire and brimstone, in hell, with the devils for all eternity. Wi.—This living water is God himself, of which the saints shall be inebriated at the source; i.e. in God himself. Enviable moment, when all the designs of God upon Jesus Christ and upon his Church will be accomplished: but how little thought of now! And how can we hope to be inebriated at this source of God above, if we do not aspire after it whilst we are in this dreary desert here below? He who begins and finishes gratuitously here below the work of our faith, crowns it still more liberally in heaven.  
**9** *I will shew thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb:* all the Church triumphant in heaven. Wi.  
**16** *The city is situate four-square;* [1] and by what follows, so as to be a perfect square, though every thing that is quadrangular is not always a square, or perfect square. Wi.  
**17** *The measure of a man, which is of an Angel.* [2] This seems, without doubt, the sense of it. Wi.  
**22** *No temple in it.* No need of a temple for divine worship, where God is in such a perfect manner present to all the blessed, where nothing can distract or divert their souls from endless adorations, praises, &c. Wi.  
**23** *Needeth not sun nor moon*, where there is no vicissitude or succession of day and night, the divine brightness always shining to them. Wi.  
**24** *The kings of the earth shall bring their glory;* the elect, of all states and conditions, shall now be exalted like kings, or rather infinitely above the glory that we can imagine of any kings in this world. Wi.  
**27** *There shall not enter it any thing defiled.* This is what we ought always to remember and have in our minds. Wi.

## Chapter 22

**1** *A river of water of life*, or of living water. It is spoken with allusion to the rivers of paradise and to the tree of life. Wi.  
**2** *For the healing of the nations*, or Gentiles, to signify the call of all Gentiles or nations to this heavenly happiness. Wi.  
**4** *They shall see his face.* Thus in a few words is expressed the happiness of the blessed in heaven; they shall *s* *ee* God, from which vision proceed love, joy, and everlasting praises of the divine Majesty. Wi.  
**6** *These words are most faithful.* Here begins the conclusion and close of all these revelations.—*Th* *e Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his Angel to shew*, &c. and in the 16th verse it is said: *I, Jesus, have sent my Angel to testify:* from whence we may understand that Jesus, as to his person, is the same Lord God with the Father, though as man he is the *root* of the offspring *of David*, of the race of David, as the Messias was to be. Wi.  
**7** *Behold I come quickly.* Man’s life is short, and at his death he must give an account to God. All time is short, if compared with eternity. S. John (v. 8) was again for casting himself at the feet of the Angel, though here it is not expressed whether it were to adore God, or whether it were by an inferior veneration to the Angel, often expressed by adoration. Wi.  
**8** **Ver.** **8–9** **.** This is the second time the saint wishes to adore the Angel, but not with the supreme worship of *latria*, as he knew the object of his worship was only an Angel, and of course a mere creature; but the Angel, through respect for S. John, still refuses the proffered honour, (see C. 19:10) and to shew the holy society that was hereafter to exist between Angels and men, who were to compose but one and the same family. V.  
**10** *Seal not the words;* as not designed to be kept sealed or secret, but to be delivered to the faithful for their instruction, that they may be prepared to suffer persecutions; that their faith, hope, and charity may be enlivened and increased by a firm expectation of their happiness in the next world, after short sufferings in this. Wi.  
**11** *He that hurteth*, (by living in sins against God, himself, and his neighbours) *let him hurt* *still;* i.e. he shall be permitted; *and he that is just, let him be justified still*, and increase in virtues by God’s assistance. Wi.—It is not an exhortation or license to go on in sin, but an intimation that how far soever the wicked may proceed, their progress shall quickly end, and then they must expect to meet with proportionable punishments. Ch.  
**13** *I am alpha and omega.* See C. 1:8. Wi.  
**14** *That they may have a right* or power to eat of the *tree of life.* A right grounded on the promises of God and his graces. Wi.  
**15** *Without* are *dogs;* meaning unbelievers, and whosever *loveth* *and maketh a lie*, i.e. all the wicked, who have not walked in the ways of truth. Wi.  
**17** *And the Spirit and the bride say: Come*. That is, the *Spirit* of God, who moves us to love and praise him; and the *bride*, i.e. the Church, the spouse of Christ, which earnestly desires to be happy in the enjoyment of God: and every one that heareth these divine promises, let him with all the affections of his soul, with his whole heart, *say: Come.* He that thirsteth after justice, the Author and Fountain of all justice, *let him come* and be filled *gratis* by the bounty and liberality of our merciful God. Wi.  
**18** **Ver.** **18–19** **.** *I*, John, *testify* and bear witness of all the truths contained in this revelation: *If any man shall add to these things*, he becomes guilty of sin, and makes himself liable to the punishments and *plagues* that are *written in this book.* Wi.  
**20** **Ver.** **20–21** **.** *He that giveth testimony of these things*, i.e. God, and Jesus Christ by an Angel, saith, *surely*, (or even so, or truly, these are certain truths) *I come quickly*, to reward the good and punish the evil. To which words S. John himself replieth with a zealous prayer and earnest desire, saying, *Amen*, let it be so.—*Come, Lord Jesus:* come, and remain always in my soul by thy grace, and make me partaker of thy glory for ever and ever. Amen. Wi.—**Conclusion.** The Church in sighs and groans, and by the mouth of her children, solicits the coming of Jesus Christ, her divine Spouse. The fruit to be drawn from the perusal of this sacred book, is ardently to desire the kingdom of God, to sigh after the day of eternity, to feel the weight of the yoke of the present life, and the disgrace of our exile, and to live here below as strangers. Enkindle in me, O Lord, this desire; enable my poor soul to join with the beloved disciple in this prayer: *Come, Lord Jesus;* that she may go and lose herself in Thee, who art her Centre, her God, her All.
