# Amos Commentary

**Amos** prophesied in Israel about the same time as Osee, and was called from following the cattle to denounce God’s judgments to the people of Israel and the neighbouring nations, for their repeated crimes, in which they continued with repentance. Ch.—The kingdom was then almost free from idolatry, except that of the calves, yet dissolute and flourishing under Jeroboam II. The prophet spoke at Bethel, (C. 7) till the idolatrous priest, Amasias, forced him to flee to Thecua, four leagues south of Jerusalem, where he continued to prophesy against the various nations of Damascus, Juda, &c. but particularly against Israel. C. 1. &c. How long he continued is uncertain. S. Jerom and others account his style rustic; but S. Aug. (Doct. iv. 7.) as good a judge, pronounces that it was eloquent, and like that of the other inspired writers, suited to the speakers. C.—Amos means “one carrying,” or “a people torn away.” S. Jer. in Joel. H.—He deals in metaphors agreeably to his pastoral education, but is profound in sense. Id. ep. ad Paulin.—After denouncing judgments on different nations, he foretells the coming of Christ and abundance of grace. W.

## Chapter 1

**1** *Herdsmen.* S. Jerom’s MSS. after Aquila, have “pastorals,” ( H.) *pastoralibus* *.* C.—Theodotion retains Nokedim. Sept. read Accarim, ( H.) substituting *r* for *d*, (S. Jer.) and perhaps *a* for *n.* H.—They have also “Jerusalem,” for *Israel*, though the prophecy regard the latter. The country south of *Thecua* has no towns, and is solely for pasture. S. Jer.—Amos might have many flocks, like Mesa and king Dejotarus. 4 K. 3:4. C.—David was taken from the flocks to be king, and Amos to be a prophet. W.—*King.* These two lived long in prosperity. C.—*Earthquake.* Many understand this of a great *earthq* *uake*, which, they say, was felt at the time that king Ozias attempted to offer incense in the temple. But the best chronologists prove that the earthquake here spoken of must have been before that time: because Jeroboam the second, under whom Amos prophesied, was dead long before that attempt of Ozias. Ch.—This is asserted by Usher. Yet his arguments are not conclusive. If the attempt and earthquake happened in the 23d year of Ozias, Amos might commence A. 3215, six years before the death of Jeroboam. 4 K. 15:5. Zac. 11:15. C.—Josephus (ix. 1.) fixes upon the former period. Jeroboam, however, died in the 38th of Ozias, who was deposed 14 years later. W.  
**2** *Carmel.* “God’s vineyard,” may dente any fruitful mountain. Amos refers to pastoral affairs. C.  
**3** *Three-four.* That is, for their many unrepented of crimes. Ch.—three is the first number of which we can say “many or all.” Four denotes excess. Thus God forgives many sins, yet punishes when they become excessive. W.—Thus profane authors say, ( C.)  
**5** *Plain.* The city “Bikhath—Aven,” or the latter word, probably denotes Baal, as the Syrians style Baal-Bek, the city which the Greeks call Heliopolis. The valley between the two mountains extending northward, is still called Bucca.—*Pleasure.* Heb. “Beth Heden.” We find Eden in a delightful part of Libanus.—*Cyrene*, not in Africa, but on the river Cyrus, in Albania. 4 K. 15:29.  
**6** Edom*.* the Philistines and Tyrians (v. 9) exercised this inhumanity on the Idomeans, probably before they had thrown off the yoke of Juda, under Joram, (4 K. 8:21) as the Lord seems concerned for them; ( C.) or they sold the captive Israelites to Edom, to increase their misery. S. Jer.—Sept. “the captivity of Solomon,” or the subjects of that monarch. But the Heb. word means also *perfect*, ( H.) or absolute, (Jer. 13:19. C.) or “pacific,” seizing the citizens in times of peace. H.  
**7** *Gaza.* Ozias, Ezechias, and Psammetichus, ravaged the country. 2 Par. 26:6 and 4 K. 18:8. Is. 14:29. The Philistines recovered strength; but Nabuchodonosor, Alexander, and the Machabees conquered them again.  
**9** *Brethren;* for Edom and the Jews sprung from the same stock. Some think that he alludes to the alliance of the king of Tyre and David. But that had long ceased, and was not agreeable to the law; (Ex. 22:23. and 3 K. 9:13. C.) at least when it was attended with much danger. H.  
**10** *Thereof.* Salmanasar besieged it five years (Menander) and Nabuchodonosor thirteen, when he destroyed Tyre. Ezec. 26.  
**11** *Sword.* Edom was subdued by David, and remained tributary till Joram. It attempted to recover its liberty under Josaphat, though the Heb. text have improperly *Aram.* 2 Par. 20:2, 23. The two nations were often at variance. C.—*Cast off.* Sept. “violated the womb, *or* the mother on the earth.”  
**12** *Houses*, &c. Sept. “its foundations,” ( H.) or the fortified country. S. Jer.—Bosor lay towards Philadelphia, in the ancient territory of Edom. Their strong places were seized by Ozias, by the Chaldeans, and by the Machabees.  
**13** *Border.* They pretended that Galaad belonged to them. Judg. 11:12. David subdued Ammon; but after the division of the kingdom, they recovered their independence, and took occasion to commit these cruelties, while Israel had to contend with Syria. Jeremias (49:1) speaks of a later period.  
**14** *Babba*, the capital, called also Philadelphia. Ozias and Joatham attacked the people with advantage. C.  
**15** *Melchom*, the god or idol of the Ammonites, otherwise called Moloch, and Melech; which, in Heb. signifies a *ki* *ng*, or Melchom *their king.* Ch.—He assumed the title of “their king.” Judg. 11:14. Jer. 49:3. H.—Blind people, who could not see the vanity of such impotent gods! C.—*Both he.* Sept. “and their priests.” H.

## Chapter 2

**1** *Ashes.* Some think that he alludes to 4 K. 3:27 or rather to some war, the ashes of the dead were disturbed. C.—Both these acts of inhumanity deserved severe punishment. W.  
**2** *Fire:* war under Ozias. C.—*Carioth* *.* Sept. “the cities.” Carioth has this meaning, but is was also the name of a great city. Jer. 48:24. H.  
**3** *Judge*, ruler, or head, shall be no more.  
**4** *Walked.* After Solomon, scarcely a good prince appeared, till the days of Amos. Juda imitated the idolatry of Israel, hoping thus to find assistance. C.—His crime was the more grievous, as they had the law. W.  
**5** **V** **er.** **5** **.** *Fire.* Under Joathan, Rasin, &c. invaded the country. Achaz increased the misery, by applying to the Assyrians. C.  
**6** *Just man.* Joseph, (Rupert) or our Saviour, (Sanct.) or any other. The expression is proverbial. Ezec. 13:19. C.—Israel contemned the law, and adopted the abominations of all. W.  
**7** *Humble*, provoking him to anger.—*Name.* Such incests caused infidels to blaspheme. Lev. 18:8. C.—They must be punished with severity. W.  
**8** *Altar.* Herein they offended doubly, (Ex. 22:26) as they used the garments of others to hide their shameful actions. 4 K. 23:7. C.—Sept. “and tying up their garments with cords, they made veils touching the altar, and drank wine *procured* by calumnies,” ( H.) or “rapine,” &c. Chal.—*Condemned* by them unjustly, though some think that a very delicious and intoxicating wine is meant, such as was given to people in grief. Prov. 31:6. Mark 15:23. Helena learnt in Egypt how to compose such wine. Odys. iv.—Feasting in temples on carpets was an ancient custom.  
**9** *Beneath.* The Israelites seemed like locusts in comparison. Num. 13:34.  
**11** *Nazarites.* Some went secretly to Jerusalem for this purpose; or perhaps they performed these rites illegally at Bethel: for many parts of the law were observed, though not perfectly. C. 4:4. The Nazarites were in high estimation. Lam. 4:7. But the dissolute Israelites ( C.) derided them as well as the prophets, ( H.) and attempted to make them transgress. C.  
**13** *I will screek.* Unable to bear any longer the enormous load of your sins, &c. The Spirit of God, as S. Jerom takes notice, accommodates itself to the education of the prophet, and inspires him with encouragements taken from country affairs. Ch.—Sept. “I am overturned.” Heb. “pressed.” C.  
**14** *Swift.* Jeroboam I. Other kings are described afterwards. S. Jer.—In the latter times all was in confusion. C.

## Chapter 3

**1** *Family*, including all the posterity of Jacob. W.—He afterwards addresses the ten tribes in particular. S. Jer. C.  
**2** *Known*, with love, ( H.) and favoured with the law, &c. Above all, styling you my people. Ex. 19:6. Ezec. 20:5. C.—*Visit.* That is, punish. Ch.—I will treat you like my children, that I may spare you in eternity. C.  
**3** *Agreed?* As t hey cannot do this well, so neither can man be acceptable to God, unless he keep his laws. W.—The prophet here proves his mission, intimating that if he were not inspired, he would soon be open to detection. He had been banished from Bethel. C. 7. By many similes, he shows that the event will prove the sincerity of his character, and that he cannot resist the holy spirit which is in him.  
**4** *Nothing?* Thus, shall I inveigh against your crimes, if there were no need?  
**5** *Somewhat?* When the prophet speaks, has he no reason? God shews that he has sent him, by inflicting the punishments which he denounces.  
**6** *Afra* *id.* Yet you can hear these terrible truths without consternation! Will you therefore escape? C.—*Evil.* He speaks of the *evil* of sin, of which God is not the author. Ch.—All evil of punishment is sent by God, either to reclaim sinners or to be the beginning of sorrows, if they die impenitent. W.—You know that He rewards or punishes. If, therefore, what I foretell come to pass, do not blame me.  
**7** *Prophets.* In vain then would you silence them. C. 2:12, and 7:12. He always tends to the conclusion. v. 8. C.  
**9** *Azotus.* Sept. “Assyrians.”—*Follies.* Sept. “wonders.” Let you greatest enemies know what crimes you commit against yourselves ( H.) and others.  
**11** *About*, As oxen tread out corn, going round a tree. C.—Sept. “Tyre even all round, thy land shall be a desert.” Tsar means “Tyre and tribulation,” according to S. Jerom’s master. H.  
**12** *Ear:* things of small value. Thus few even of the poor will escape the Assyrians. M.—*Damascus.* Some render “couch side.” But there is no proof of this being accurate. Jeroboam II. subdued Damascus, and reigned in prosperity. Who would then have thought that Israel should so soon be removed into Media? C.—Sept. “over-against the tribe of *Juda*, and in Damascus, priests hear,” &c. They probably left *hares*, ( H.) “couches,” (Aquila) untranslated, and some person has substituted “priests.” S. Jer.—Only the miserable M. or fugitives escape the enemy. H.  
**14** *Bethel.* Manahem seems to have sent one of the calves to engage Phul to come to his assistance. Osee 10:5 and 4 K. 15:19. Salmanasar had both. Osee 8:5. Josias afterwards defiled the profane altars. 4 K. 23:15.—*Horns*, made of brass, which the Assyrians carried off. C.—The fairest possessions of sinners will at last perish. W.  
**15** *Winter.* Sept. “winged house,” to keep off cold, (S. Jer.) or to give air. C.—*Summer-house.* The noblemen had such is cooler regions. M.—The kings of Persia passed the summer at Ecbatana. Xen. Cyr. viii.—Palladius (1:12) orders that the summer apartments must look to the north.—*Ivory.* Many ornaments of this nature appeared in them, ( C.) whence Achab’s palace was so called. 3 K. 22:39. H.

## Chapter 4

**1** *Fat kine.* He means the great ones that lived in plenty and wealth, ( Ch.) and without restraint, (Is. 15:5. Jer. 46:20. C.) having no compassion for the poor. W.—The women who had too great an ascendency over their husbands, like Jezabel, may also be meant. Theod. Grot.—In many parts of the East the women affect being fat.  
**2** *Holiness.* He has none but himself to swear by. Heb. 6:13. His word is infallible; but he condescends to use an oath to make a deeper impression on man.—*Pikes;* spits, or large shields. Heb. also, “They will lead you away with hooks, (in the nose, Is. 37:29) and your children with fish-hooks,” or pots. You shall be treated like victims, being either roasted or boiled. No part shall be left.  
**3** *Breaches* of the city. C.—Sept. “naked.” Heb. “apart.” H.—The victors shall divide you among them. C.—*Armon*, a foreign country; some understand it of Armenia, ( Ch.) and this is the general opinion. M.—Sept. “on Mount Remmon.” Theodot. “Mona.” Israel was removed into *Armenia*, “the mountain of Menni.” Jer. 51:27.  
**4** Galgal. Thither the people went of their own accord, as to a place of devotion. Osee 4:15. Amos ironically tells them to proceed, as Christ addressed the Jews. Mat. 23:32. C.—After many admonitions have proved fruitless, God suffers infidels to act as they please. W.—This is the most dreadful of his judgments. H.—*Morning*, with haste.—*Three days.* This also may denote the false exactitude of the Israelites to perform what God did not require, while they neglected the most essential duties, like the Pharisees. It may also imply the giving tithes every third year, (Deut. 14:28) or presenting themselves at the three great festivals. Ex. 23:14. The schismatics observed parts of the law, and had a devotion of their own *choice.* C.  
**5** *With.* Heb. mechamets, ( H.) also “without leaven.” It was expressly forbidden, (Lev. 2:11) though not in the first fruits. Lev. 23:17.—*It*, to beg that God would remember you. Num. 10:10. Hence the Pharisees did so when they gave alms, (Mat. 6:2. C.) but out of ostentation. H.—Sept. “And they read the law *of their own invention*, (Theod.) or *of God*, out of *the land*, (which the Jews were not to do. S. Chrys. or. 3. c. Jud. Const. Apost. vi. 24.) and proclaimed praise *or* confession.” H.—These interpreters read inaccurately, ( C.) *krau méuts thure*, &c. yet S. Jerom explains their words of heretics reading the Scriptures out of the true Church, and misapplying them.  
**6** *Dulness*, (*stuporem*) as when the teeth have bitten at a stone ( H.) and are edged. Jer. 31:29. Sept. “gnashing.” Heb. “cleanness,” through want of food. Eliseus foretold a famine under Achab. 4 K. 8:1. That of Joel (1) seems to have happened later than this. C.—God sent these afflictions for their amendment. W.  
**7** *Months.* The latter rain falls in April. See Deut. 11:14. C.—*Harvest.* Sept. have as usual, “vintage.” But this is less accurate, as it never rains in the preceding summer months. S. Jer.  
**9** *Wind* *.* Prot. “blasting.” H.—“Pestilential air,” (Sept. Sym. &c.) which destroys the corn ( C.) and men. H.  
**10** *Egypt*, as I published the Egyptians, ( C.) or the Hebrews, when they came thence, and wished to return. Chal. S. Cyr.—*Horses.* I have deprived you of them, ( H.) under Achab and Joachaz. 4 K. 6 and 13.—*Nostrils.* Hazael slew many subjects of Jehu. 4 K. 10:32. C.—The stench of their carcasses and of the locusts caused *death* or the plague. H.  
**11** *Burning.* This comparison shews the condition of Israel. Hardly any escaped. Zac. 3:2 and 1 Cor. 3:15. C.  
**12** *These.* He mentions not what, to keep them in greater suspense and dread; (S. Jer.) or he will put in execution what he had threatened before. v. 2.—*Meet.* Sept. “beseech.” Aq. “oppose,” or to receive the Messias. S. Jer.—Prepare by repentance to find mercy. C.—After long captivity, Christ will save some. W.  
**13** *Wind.* Sept. “the Spirit, and announcing to man his Christ,” ( H.) or Cyrus. Theod.—But this version has read improperly. C.—Some hence brought an argument against the divinity of the Holy Spirit. S. Jer.—*Mist.* Sept. “the morning and the cloud,” spreading light or darkness over man.—*Earth, on the wings of the wi* *nd.* Ps. 17:11. C.  

---

## Chapter 5

**1** *Lamentation.* Such canticles were usual. Is. 14.—*Israel.* It no longer formed a separate kingdom. C.—When the people fear no evil, God laments for them. W.  
**3** *City*, before ( C.) or after the captivity. It required a long time to fill the cities as they had been. H.—When the Assyrians invaded the country, it was greatly reduced. C.  
**5** *Bethel, … Galgal, … Bersabee.* The places where they worshipped their idols. Ch.—They had all been honoured by the patriarchs. Bersabee had belonged to Juda under Achab. 3 K. 19:3. But it was originally in the tribe of Simeon, and Jeroboam II. recovered all that had been lost. 4 K. 14:25. C.—*Unprofitable.* Heb. leaven, “for vanity,” ( H.) Bethaven.  
**6** *Joseph.* His two grandchildren gave name to the principle tribes of the kingdom.—*Bethel* *.* Sept. “Israel,” which seems preferable. C.—Yet Bethel may stand, as it denotes the apostate Israelites.  
**7** *You.* Sept. “the Lord, [God] who does judgment on high, and has placed justice on the earth; (8) who maketh and transformeth all things, and turneth,” &c. H.—Heb. agrees with the Vulg. C.  
**8** *Arcturus and Orion.* Arcturus is a bright star in the north, Orion a beautiful constellation in the south. Ch.—Shepherds in Arabia and Spain are well acquainted with the stars. C.—We have examined the meaning of cima and *cesil*, Job 9:9 and 38:31. S. Jerom’s master asserts that the latter means “efflugence.” Cima is rendered the Pleiades by Aquila and Th.; “the seven stars,” by Prot. H.—When such allusions to the heathen mythology occur, they give no sanction to it, but serve to explain what is meant. S. Jer.—*Morning*, affording comfort. C. 4:13.—*Earth*, by floods ( C.) or rain. S. Jer.  
**9** *With a smile.* That is, with all ease, and without making any effort. Ch.—Aquila has “grinning,” to shew displeasure. S. Jer.—Heb. “he strengthens the oppressor against the strong,” so that those whom he pleases to chastise cannot escape.  
**10** *They*, the wicked, could not endure Amos, (C. 7:12) nor those who rebuked them.  
**12** *Grievous.* Heb. also, “numerous.”  
**13** *Time.* It is to no purpose speaking to the deaf, (Eccli. 32:9) or throwing pearls before swine. Mat. 7:6. Amos was silent for a while, till God opened his mouth again. C. 3:8 and 7:12.  
**14** *Said.* Probably Amaias took occasion, from the flourishing state of the kingdom, to assert that the Lord approved of their conduct. C.  
**15** *May be.* God will not be wanting on his side. But this implies that man may find a difficulty in seeking good, and neglect to do it, though he may if he please, with God’s assistance. W.—*Remnant.* Posterity. C.  
**16** *Lament.* Such hired mourners often seemed more grieved than those who were really affected. Hor. art. All were invited to join in the common sorrow. Jer. 9:17 and 48:31.  
**18** *The day.* Some imprudently laughed at the prophets. Is. 5:19. Jer. 17:15. Others wished for the coming of the Lord, not reflecting that he would punish their guilt. C.—Thus, many through impatience, desire to die. We must rather, repent, and leave our lives at God’s disposal. S. Jer.  
**19** *Serpent* *.* All his attempts would thus proved abortive. The Israelites were not ruined by Phul, or by Theglathphalassar. But the *serpent*, ( H.) Salmanasar, came and took them in their own houses. 4 K. 17:7. C.  
**21** *Festivities.* Some were still observed. C. 4:4.  
**22** *Vows.* Heb. “peace-offerings of your mercies;” a sort of oxen. 2 K. 6:13 and 3 K. 1:9. Sept. “the salvation of your appearance,” or what you offer for your welfare.  
**23** *Harp.* Praise ill becomes the sinner. Eccli. 15:9. Ps. 49:17.  
**24** *Mighty.* Heb. “Ethan.” Let your virtue appear, or the greatest miseries will shortly overwhelm you. C.  
**25** *Did you offer*, &c. Except the sacrifices that were offered at the first, in the dedication of the tabernacle, the Israelites offered no sacrifices in the desert. Ch.—They ceased after the beginning of the second year. S. Aug. q. 47 in Ex. Lev. 7. &c. W.—God did not require sacrifices when the people came out of Egypt. Jer. 7:22. Deut. 12:8. They were not performed so regularly in the desert, ( C.) and the people still bore a secret affection for idols, (v. 26) which rendered all their victims useless. H.  
**26** *A tabernacle*, &c. All this alludes to the idolatry which they committed, when they were drawn away by the daughters of Moab to the worship of their gods. Num. 25. Ch.—They imitated the superstitions of Egypt, and bore the image of Osiris, adorned with a star and crescent, on a sort of base, under a canopy. Heb. “You carried the tents of your king and the base of your statues, the star of your gods, which you have made for yourselves.” Sept. by changing ( C.) *ciun* in *Rephan*, or ραιφαν, ( H.) have caused great confusion among commentators. If any change were requisite, ( C.) cima ( H.) would be preferable. v. 8. Job 9:9. Yet the Heb. seems to be correct, and *chiun* denotes a pedestal rather than an idol. Some read *Kevan*, the Saturn of the Arabs, &c. and think that *Rephan* has been mistaken for it. The only difficulty is the authority of S. Stephen, who follows the Sept. Acts 7:43. Yet he probably spoke in Syriac, and might pronounce *Chevan;* though S. Luke might adopt the Sept. in a matter of so little consequence. C. Diss.—This decision may not probably give satisfaction to those who reflect that both these authors were under the immediate influence of the Holy Ghost, and that if an error had crept into the copy of the Sept. he would have corrected it. Truth is always of sufficient consequence. See Kennicott, Diss. ii. p. 344. H.—*Chiu* *n* and *Rephan* are “expressive of the same” god or idol, representing the *machine* of the heavens. The people of Peru worshipped Choun. Parkhurst, p. 137.—*Remvan* may be Remmon, (4 K. 6:18) or Saturn. Grot.—In a Coptic alphabet of the planets it is thus explained: (De Dieu. Collier. Dict. Sept. and Acts) “You have taken the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your Rempham, figures,” &c. Prot. marg. “the *Siccuth*, your king, and *Chiun*, your images, the star,” &c. H.  
**27** *Damacus*, or *Babylon*, (Acts 7) into Mesopotamia, &c. The sense is the same. C.—When the apostles quote passages, “they do not consider the words but the sense.” S. Jer.—One Greek copy, however, has *Damascus* in the Acts. H.

## Chapter 6

**1** *Wealthy.* Sept. Syr. and Arab. “despisers of Sion.” Heb. also, “who hate Sion.” The prophecy wholly regards Israel. C.—It is a great crime for the rich to neglect the poor; but still more so, when wealthy clergymen shew no compassion for the spiritual or corporal wants of their neighbours. W.—*State.* Heb. “to whom the house of Israel comes” for judgment.  
**2** *Chalane* *.* Ctesiphon ( C.) was built on its ruins. Gen. 10:10. H.—Why do you imitate these cities? or, has their greatness protected them? Phul probably took Chanane, and Jeroboam II. the other cities. v. 15 and 4 K. 14:25. At that time there was no appearance of the kingdom being destroyed; yet Amos composes a funeral canticle, to shew the certainty of the event.  
**3** *Separated.* Heb. “remove the evil day,” as if it would not overtake you. Ezec. 12:22. Sept. “who are praying ( C.) *or* coming (Grabe) to the evil day, approaching and touching false sabbaths.” H.—They pray to be delivered, while they continue ( C.) their false worship. H.  
**4** *Ivory*, with which the beds for eating were adorned. v. 7. C.—*Wanton.* Heb. “stretch themselves out upon their,” &c. H.  
**5** *David.* They think they excel him in music; but he consecrated his talent to a better purpose. C.—Sept. “they deemed them stable, and not fugitive things.” H.—They have placed their chief good in such pleasures. Theod. C.  
**6** *In bowels.* Sept. “refined,” ( H.) or cleared of the dregs.—*Joseph*, of their brethren, or they seem to have no share in the sufferings of mankind. Ps. 72:5.  
**7** *Luxurious.* Heb. “the feast of those who stretch themselves out, shall,” &c. Sept. “the neighing shall be removed from Ephraim.” His lusts shall be punished. Jer. 5:8.—Some translate Heb. “the mourning of those who stretch themselves on their beds is at hand.” Others, “their funeral feast is distant.” None shall bewail their death. So ambiguous is the original. C.  
**8** *Jacob.* God loved the humility of the patriarch, and hated the pride of his posterity. W.  
**9** *Die.* Their numbers will not protect them from the plague.  
**10** *Burn.* After the captivity, it was more common to bury or to embalm the dead. C.  
**11** *Lord.* He has done it. Do not repine. Theod. S. Cyr.—Heb. “Be silent, and not to remember the,” &c. He will offer comfort. C.—Still, none will return to the Lord. S. Jer.  
**12** *Clefts.* All shall perish, ( C.) both Israel and Juda. Chal. Grot.—But he speaks only of the former.  
**13** *Buffles*, which cannot be tamed. Heb. “with oxen.” We must understand, *on rocks.* C.—Sept. “Shall they be silent when they are with females?” H.—To turn the works of justice into sins, is no less unnatural than to plough with wild buffles. W.  
**14** *Naught:* in your idols, which are nothing, (1 Cor. 8:4) or in your own strength, fortifications, or allies.—*Horns:* glory and power. C.—*Pa rata tollo cornua* *.* Hor. epod. 6.  
**15** *Nation;* the Assyrians.—*Desert*, commonly called Bezor, ( C.) between Damietta and Rhinocorura. S. Jer.—The whole territory of Israel, reaching so far, (v. 2) shall be laid waste. C.

## Chapter 7

**1** *The locust*, &c. These judgments by locusts and fire, which by the prophet’s intercession were moderated, signify the former invasions of the Assyrians under Phul and Theglathphalassar, before the utter desolation of Israel by Salmanasar. Ch.—Locusts denoted the Assyrian invaders. 4 K. 18. W.—*Formed.* Lit. “the maker of the locust, in the beginning of the *herbs* shooting,” &c. ( H.) in spring. S. Jer.—They pasture in our January: yet the grass of autumn may be meant. The king took the best which grows in summer. C.—Sept. “and lo, a swarm of locusts coming in the morning; and lo, one bruchus, Gog, the king,” ( H.) or “against king Gog.” C.—Aquila has, “of the king of Gaza.” He probably left the original term, (S. Jer.) *gizze.* H.—The invasion of the Assyrians, Chaldeans, and Scythians is insinuated. Theod.—The latter came the year after the earthquake. C. 1. Pezron.—This was the first vision of Amos. C.—He saw the first and last inroads of the Assyrians, as well as the prosperity of Jeroboam. M.  
**2** *When.* Sept. “If it shall eat up,” &c. H.—*Little.* After Jeroboam II. the kingdom fell to decay, when Manahem called in the Assyrians. C.  
**3** *The.* Sept. “Repent, O Lord, on this head, and this shall,” &c.—*Not be:* the grass shall not be totally devoured. H.—The king of the Assyrians invaded Juda in vain. 4 K. 19. W.  
**4** *Part* of the land, if the prophet had not interposed; (v. 6. C.) or rather civil wars desolated a great part of the kingdom, before the Lord was appeased. H.—The fire foreshewed the captivity of the two tribes. 4 K. 24. W.  
**6** *The.* Sept. as v. 3. H.—We read not of locusts being sent, v. 1. But fire of war certainly raged before the final catastrophe of Jehu’s family, when Sellum slew Zacharias. 4 K. 15:8. C.  
**7** *Plastered.* Heb. “wall, made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.” Prot. H.—But Sept. Syr. &c. seem more literal, ( C.) “on a wall of adamant, and a diamond in his hand.” Heb. anac, ( H.) whence a diamond was called *anactites*, (Orpheus) or *anachites* *.* Pliny xxxvii. 4.—Saturn had a scythe of adamant, and walls of this kind were deemed impervious even to the inhabitants of heaven. Thus Virgil describes the gates of hell:  
**8** *Plaster.* Sept. “I will no more pass over it,” the adamantine wall. I will hide their faults no longer. H.—this third vision alluded to the distress of the ten tribes. 4 K. 15:20. W.  
**9** *Idol.* Heb. “Isaac.” C.—Sept. “laughter.” H.—Isaac had resided for some time at Bersabee, which was place frequented by idolaters. C. 5:5 and 8:14. Josias overthrew (4 K. 13:8. C.) the profane “altars.” H.—*Sword.* His son Zacharias was slain after six months reign. v. 6. 11.  
**10** *Words.* Nothing could be more unfounded. Amos had indeed denounced many judgments; but he was not wanting in respect to the king. C.  
**11** *Sword.* the prophet did not say this, but that the Lord would *rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the* *sword;* which was verified when Zacharias, the son and successor of Jeroboam, was slain by the sword. 4 K. 15:10. Ch.—The false prophet was therefore guilty of a lie. They accuse the preachers of truth as traitors. W.—Thus many missionary priests have been traduced in England. H.  
**12** *Seer.* This was the ancient title of prophets; (1 K. 9:9. C.) but it is here used contumeliously. H.—We know not whether Amasias acted by the king’s order or not. He was less afraid of the predictions than of losing his employment. C.  
**13** *Sanctuary*, or “palace.” Kimchi.—The kings resided commonly in Samaria; but they came hither to practise their religion, and had a palace. C.—The *king’s choice* was all that Amasias regarded, as many seem still to do, without examining whether the religion be true or false! Will the king screen them from the indignation of the just Judge at the hour of death? H.  
**14** *I am not a prophet.* That is, I am not a prophet by education: nor is prophesying my calling or profession: but I am a herdsman, whom God was pleased to send hither to prophesy to Israel. Ch.—He speaks with the like humility as the baptist, John 1:21. Lu. 7:26. It seems the prophets usually left their trade, and applied to meditation. Zac. 8:5. Sept. “I was not a prophet, nor,” &c.—*Plucking.* Sept. (Th.) “pricking.” C.—This was requisite to make the fruit ripen in four days’ time. Pliny xiii. 7. and xvi. 27.—Wild fig-trees have three sorts of fruits. The flies which proceed from some of them, prick the sweet figs, and make them ripen. Tourefort i. let. 8.—Amos probably conveyed such wild figs to be near those of the garden, while at other times he fed his cattle.  
**16** *Drop.* menaces. Ezec. 20:46. Sept. “thou shalt not disturb ( C.) *or* threaten the house of Jacob.” S. Jer.—*Idol;* the calf, worshipped in Bethel. Ch.—Heb. “Isaac,” as v. 9. H.  
**17** *Play.* Symmachus has better, “shall be treated as a harlot.” A “husband would rather hear that his wife had been slain than defiled.” S. Jer.—*Line*, and divided among strangers.—*Land*, out of Palestine. All other countries were deemed unclean. Amasias was probably exiled, or led captive by Theglathphalassar, as Salmanasar did not come till sixty-two years after the death of Jeroboam. We know no more of the history of Amasias. The martyrologies say he slew Amos. C.—His name means “rigid,” and he was a true image of a heretic. “All that he possesses shall fall to the share of devils.” S. Jer.

## Chapter 8

**1** *Hook.* Heb. “basket of summer fruit.” Sept. “bird cage *or* net.” H.—Israel was ripe for destruction. v. 2. C. 7:8. C.—Not only those who were near, (4 K. 15:29) but the rest also were taken, (4 K. 17:6) as we pull with a hook the fruit when we cannot reach otherwise. W.  
**3** *Temple*, when God comes like a mighty warrior; or when the profane temples shall be pillaged. C. 9:1. Heb. also, “the canticles of the temple *or* palace shall be changed into lamentations.”—*Place.* Heb. “a multitude of dead bodies shall be cast in every place. Keep silence.” C.  
**5** *Mouth:* the first day was observed as a festival. Num. 10:10. H.—At the expiration of the month usurers demanded their money. Hor. i. sat. 3. Aristoph. Nub. ii. 1.—*Corn*, to sell after the sabbatical year, when it was dearest. Sabbath also denotes all “festivals.” These misers think that there are too many.—*Sicle.* Having a large measure to buy, and a small one to sell again. Deut. 25:13. Prov. 20:10.  
**6** *Shoes*, for almost nothing. Thus they forced the poor to serve, or to sell their effects.  
**7** *Jacob*, because the rich despise the poor. It may also mean, that he swore by heaven, or the temple, (Lev. 26:19) or that he would destroy the high places. C.  
**8** *Altogether.* Sept. “its total ruin shall rise as a river.”—*Egypt.* The whole land shall be visited with misery, as Egypt is by the Nile. H.—The enemy shall retire with the booty. The Nile overflows in summer, and covers Egypt for six weeks, carrying much earth with its impetuous waves. Is. 18:2.  
**9** *Light.* Usher ( A. 3213.) explains this of an eclipse, at Pentecost. The Fathers generally understand that which accompanied the death of Christ; but it only implies great desolation and terror. Jer. 15:9. Joel 3:11. S. Jer. &c. C.—In their greatest prosperity, calamities shall unexpectedly fall upon them. W.  
**10** *Baldness*, the hair being cut in mourning. Job 1:20.—*Son*, most afflicted. Zac. 12:10. Jer. 6:26. C.  
**11** *Lord.* During the siege provisions were wanting, but instruction still more so. W.—Israel had banished Amos. They would be left destitute. We find no prophet among the during the captivity, except Tobias. C. 13:3. We may apply this to the state of the Jews since the death of Christ. They have no guides. C.—They read incessantly, and do not understand (S. Jer. Mercer.) the Bible, which non will ever penetrate who refuse to receive the key from the Church. H.  
**12** *Sea to sea:* from west to south, or to the ocean; in whatever part of the world they may be. C.  
**14** *Sin.* Sept. “propitiation,” which the pagans deemed requisite; (Hor. i. ode 2.) or worship ( H.) of Baal, (4 K. 17:16. C.) and all the other superstitions. H.—*Way.* Sept. “thy God,” or religion, (Acts 9:2) or pilgrimage to Bersabee. C. 5:5. Perhaps the true God was here adored; but it was in a manner which he condemned. C.—In vain do those pretend to honour Him, who follow the traditions of unbelieving men. H.

## Chapter 9

**1** *Altar*, in Jerusalem. C. 8:3 and 1:2. God is going to punish Israel, ( C.) or the two tribes. Chal. S. Jer.—The ruin of the altar and temple, imply the abolishing of sacrifices during the captivity, at Babylon. W.—But Amos speaks rather of Israel. C.—*Sword.* The princes and people are all guilty. Sept. “strike or cut on the heads of all.” H.  
**2** *Hell;* to the deepest caves, where they used to flee. Ps. 138:8.  
**3** *Top*, in woods, or caverns.—*Serpent* *.* Fishes and sea monsters are so called.  
**5** *A river.* Sept. “the river of Egypt.” C. 8:8. and 5:24. C.—Grabe’s ed. has “its consummation (*or* utter ruin) shall rise up as a river.” H.  
**6** *Ascension*, or his high throne. Ch.—Sept. “the ascent, and hath founded the declarations ( H.) *or* promise upon,” &c. which must be explained in a moral sense. C.—*Bundle.* That is, his Church, bound up together by the bands of one faith and communion, ( Ch.) which God will protect, and punish sinners. W.—Heb. “his apartments in heaven, and his assembly (*or* footstool) on earth.”—*Sea*, by floods, or rather by rain. C. 5:8. C.  
**7** *Ethiopians.* That is, as black as they, by your iniquities. Ch.—Chus was father of the Scythians, Arabs, &c. Yet none of these nations were under the peculiar protection of God. The Israelites depended too much on this prerogative, ( C.) which they deserved to lose by their sins. H.—God brought them out of Egypt. But he also took the Philistines from Caphtor, ( C.) and enabled them to settle in the country. H.—*Cappadocia.* Cyprus, (Gen. 10:14) or rather Crete. 1 K. C.—*Cyrene*, (Sym.) “wall,” (Th.) or “pit.” Sept. Theglathphalassar took Aram or the people of Damascus into captivity. C.—Their future return is represented as already past. Vat. Mercer.  
**9** *Ground*, to be mixed with the good corn.—Israel shall be purified in captivity. C.—Though many perished, God still preserved his Church. W.  
**10** *Us.* Such infidels delayed repentance, ( H.) or laughed at the menaces of impending ruin. C. 5:18. C.  
**11** *David.* S. James, after S. Peter, explains this of the vocation of the Gentiles. Acts 15:15. W.—After the fall of Israel, Juda still flourished: but this cannot be meant. The prosperity after the return from Babylon, or rather under Jesus Christ, must fulfil the prediction. Zorobalel had a very precarious authority, and the Machabees were not of the tribe of Juda, nor was their kingdom so flourishing or durable. C.  
**12** Edom, subdued by Hircan, with the surrounding nations. The same letters may be read *Adam*, “man,” as the Sept. have, agreeably to Acts 15:17. C.—“That the rest of men might seek the Lord, (Grabe substitutes me) and all the nations upon whom my,” &c. Edom and all mankind shall receive the glad tidings of salvation. H.  
**13** *Shall overtake*, &c. By this is meant the great abundance of spiritual blessings; which, as it were, by a constant succession, shall enrich the Church of Christ. Ch.—Munster, and his imitator, Clarius, see nothing but an allegory in this abundance and *return*, v. 14. Yet the literal sense ought to be adopted, when it involves no contradiction. Houbigant, pref. p. 297.—God promised a succession of crops to the faithful Israelites, (Lev. 26:5) and the return of the ten tribes is frequently specified. C.
